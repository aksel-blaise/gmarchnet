Statisticians frequently use complex statistical models to investigate analytical parameters, but such idealised datasets may be hard to relate to ""real-life"" examples and the literature difficult to assess. Using two faunal datasets that are more typical of archaeological and related research, one comprised of size-corrected linear measurements of bovid humeri and another of 3D geometric morphometric (GMM) shape data of African monkey skulls, and two simulated datasets, we illustrate some of the most important but often ignored issues of DFA. We specifically show why it is paramount to address ""over-fitting"" by cross-validation when applying this method and how the probability of correctly classifying cases by chance can be properly and explicitly taken into account. © 2011.","Classification accuracy; Cross-validation; Discriminant function analysis; Over-fitting; Resampling","archaeology; classification; data set; discriminant analysis; numerical model; primate; probability; skull; statistical analysis; Bovidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053448090
