However, sex determination using the skeletal remains of individuals who did not develop secondary sexual characteristics remains controversial. Accurately estimating the sex of subadults is hampered by a small number of studies based on identified skeletal collections of juvenile individuals. Here, we analyzed the sexual dimorphism of the subadult ilia using geometric morphometric techniques and individuals from the osteological collection of identified subadults from San José’s graveyard (Granada). Seventy-one left ilia from 40 males and 31 females aged between birth and 1 year were included in the analysis. Three landmarks and 27 semi-landmarks of the ilia were placed. By principal component analysis, we found that the size and shape of the ilia could be used to differentiate males and females. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Forensic anthropology; Geometric morphometrics; Ilium; Infant; Juvenile; Sex estimation","anatomic landmark; anatomy and histology; female; forensic anthropology; human; iliac bone; infant; male; newborn; principal component analysis; procedures; sex determination; Spain; Anatomic Landmarks; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Ilium; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Principal Component Analysis; Sex Determination by Skeleton; Spain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027376379
