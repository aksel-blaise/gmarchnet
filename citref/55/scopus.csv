We present an extensive study of the morphology of stemmed bifacial projectile points excavated from Garivaldino Rodrigues rockshelter (RS-TQ-58), Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. Garivaldino presents a range of dates from 11,660 to 7540calBP. Multivariate statistics applied to both traditional and geometric morphometric analyses failed to reveal any important changes in shape through time. However, the coefficients of variation presented a significant increase through time in three measurements related to projectile point neck and stem. The absence of change in shape might be related to small group size and low level of cultural innovation. Such cultural stability might be related to novelty-avoiding mechanisms or the operation of a meta-tradition that would be selected in very stable environments. On the other hand, the increase in the variation of linear measurements through time might suggest an increase in population size and copying errors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bifacial stemmed points; Brazilian archaeology; Cultural transmission; Garivaldino Rodrigues; Geometric morphometrics; Meta-tradition","archaeology; cultural history; cultural tradition; hunter-gatherer; morphometry; multivariate analysis; population size; Brazil; Rio Grande do Sul",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895755843
