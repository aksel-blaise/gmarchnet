We show that Elliptic Fourier Analysis and landmark/semi-landmark based methods can easily generate quantitative useful information relative to outline variation in lithic artifacts. This information can be used latter as raw data into univariate, multivariate analysis to explore mayor trends of morphological variation as well as relations between metric and morphological variation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030431181
