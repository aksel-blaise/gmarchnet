One long-held explanation for the variation in early Paleoindian point form is that prey size influenced the size and shape of projectile points. The study reported here evaluated this hypothesis with standard and geometric morphometric data recorded on Clovis and Folsom points from the Southern Plains and Southwest that are associated with mammoth or bison remains. Points used to hunt mammoth were found to be larger and of a different shape than points used to hunt bison, which supports the hypothesis. However, when both point type and prey size were taken into account, the results ran counter to predictions. Potential explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bison; Clovis; Folsom; Geometric morphometrics; Mammoth; Projectile points","archaeology; mammoth; morphometry; prey size; quantitative analysis; skeletal remains; Clovis [New Mexico]; New Mexico; United States; Bison",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251608170
