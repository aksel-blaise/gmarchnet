However, the variability of these characteristics is still both poorly understood and under-documented due to a lack of population-level data that are essential for reliably interpreting the fossil record of this species. Here we address the morphometric diversity of wild rabbits in seven current populations from south-western Europe. Size variations in different skeletal parts were analysed to explore the potential impact of sexual dimorphism. A geometric morphometric analysis of the third lower premolar (p3) - a tooth commonly used to distinguish leporid species - was used to evaluate the relative effects of size, phylogeny, geographical location and climate on shape variation. The results show a negligible impact of sexual dimorphism, contradicting previous studies. We also demonstrate geography and climate to be the main factors driving variation in p3 shape, potentially calling into question criteria typically used to identify rabbit species. These results are valuable not only for palaeobiologists studying the taxonomy and the evolutionary history of the leporid family but also for archaeologists interested in the socio-economic and behavioural aspects of Palaeolithic human groups. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.","adaptation; climatic influences; fossil record; morphometric variability; Oryctolagus cuniculus; sexual dimorphism; tooth geometric morphometrics","adaptation; archaeology; fossil record; hunting; lagomorph; morphometry; new species; paleoenvironment; Paleolithic; paleontology; prehistoric; sexual dimorphism; species diversity; taxonomy; tooth; wild population; Leporidae; Oryctolagus cuniculus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070835141
