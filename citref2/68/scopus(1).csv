Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

One of the most persistent of these is the assumed correlation between blade technologies, Upper Paleolithic industries, and anatomically (and behaviorally) modern humans. In this paper, we review some of the evidence for the production of early blade technologies in Eurasia and Africa dating to the late Lower and the Middle Paleolithic. The basic techniques for blade production appeared thousands of years before the Upper Paleolithic, and there is no justification for linking blades per se to any particular aspect of hominid anatomy or to any major change in the behavioral capacities of hominids. It is true that blades came to dominate the archaeological records of western Eurasia and Africa after 40,000 years ago, perhaps as a consequence of increasing reliance on complex composite tools during the Upper Paleolithic. At the same time, evidence from other regions of the world demonstrates that evolutionary trends in Pleistocene Eurasia were historically contingent and not universal.

The method is conceptually more parsimonious than more traditional biometric methods based on discrete linear and angular measurements. Most importantly, however, shape analysis captures a much higher proportion of the morphological information resident in any fossil than analyses based on discrete measurements. The number of harmonics required in an elliptic Fourier analysis can be estimated from a series of inverse Fourier reconstructions, or from the power spectrum. In most studies it is appropriate to normalize Fourier coefficients for size, although this information can be reincorporated at a later stage. The coefficients should probably not be standardized, unless there is evidence to suggest that high‐frequency information was genetically as important as low‐frequency information. Depending upon the aims of a particular study and the morphological disparity of the fossils in question, it might be appropriate to eliminate the first harmonic (‘best‐fitting’) ellipse from an analysis. Meaningful comparison of the left and right valves of bivalves requires the digitized coordinates of one or other to be mirrored prior to computation of the Fourier coefficients. □Biometric analysis, Bivalvia, elliptic Fourier analysis, morphometrics.

Numerous studies were aimed at creating systematic typologies of artifacts based on descriptions of their technical features and morphological attributes. Recently, the concept of chaîne opératoire, or ""operational sequence"" (sometimes called ""core reduction sequence""), borrowed from French social anthropologists, has been introduced into the study of Old World prehistory. Its conceptual framework is focused on the recognition of the overall technology and the practical skills of the prehistoric knapper in employing a particular technique responsible for the transformation of raw material to tools. Although the stone objects of all periods received attention, those of the Middle Paleolithic - due to issues such as the significance of lithic variability in retouched tools, the demise of the Neanderthals, or the emergence of ""modern behavior""-have been at the forefront. This paper discusses the definition of chaîne opératoire and its practice and demonstrates that as a system of classification, it is overformalized and provides but an illusion of reading the minds of prehistoric knappers. The need to pay more attention to the recognition of patterning in the technological information is essential if we wish to go beyond a formal type list of knapping products. We argue that an elaborate, complex typology of core reduction products and discrete chaînes opératoires is an approach that impedes informed behavioral interpretations by forcing a rigid framework of ""technical"" definitions on the prehistoric lithic technologies. © 2009 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

The aim of this article is to assess the grounds on which these claims have been advanced, and then work towards a better establishment of the cognitive implications of Levallois manufacture. Latest developments in the technological understanding of Levallois are presented in their context, and then put to work through a detailed case study: the analysis, in quantitative and qualitative terms, of a comprehensively refitted Levallois core from the 250,000 year-old site of Maastricht-Belvédère, in the Netherlands. By reconstructing and following the sequence of work on this highly productive core, it can be shown that its knapping did not simply entail the execution of a pre-set program, nor did it respond in an adventitious manner to external constraints. Rather, it is argued that the course of action was a structured and goal-oriented one, a generative interplay between the mental and material activities of the ancient flintknapper.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000537339

Several improvements to the method are described herein; these modifications are incorporated into the new computer programs Hangle, Hmatch and Hcurve. First, automated tracing of outlines using image capture software, although desirable, results in high frequency pixel 'noise' that can corrupt the Fourier analysis. Program Hangle eliminates this noise using optional and variable levels of outline smoothing. Secondly, a widely used Fourier technique, elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA, Kuhl and Giardina 1982), yields coefficients that are not computationally independent of each other, a condition that hampers and compromises statistical analysis. In addition, EFA increasingly downweights successively more detailed features of the outline. Program Hangle solves both of these problems. Lastly, Fourier methods in general are sensitive to the placement of the starting position of the digitized trace. This problem is acute when the organisms under study have no unambiguously defined, homologous point on the outline from which to start the trace. Program Hangle allows the user to normalize for starting position using various properties of individual outlines. Alternatively, Hmatch takes a new approach and can be used to normalize using properties of the entire population under study.","Foraminiferal outlines; Fourier shape analysis; Morphometric studies; New computer programs","morphometry",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033758975

Their association with both Neanderthals and early modern humans has, in particular, fuelled such debate. Yet, controversy exists regarding the extent of 'predetermination' and 'standardization' in so-called 'preferential Levallois flakes' (PLFs). Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an experimental and morphometric approach, we assess the degree of standardization in PLFs compared to the flakes produced during their manufacture. PLFs possess specific properties that unite them robustly as a group or 'category' of flake. The properties that do so, relate most strongly to relative flake thicknesses across their surface area. PLFs also exhibit significantly less variability than the flakes generated during their production. Again, this is most evident in flake thickness variables. A further aim of our study was to assess whether the particular PLF attributes identified during our analyses can be related to current knowledge regarding flake functionality and utility. Conclusions/Significance: PLFs are standardized in such a manner that they may be considered 'predetermined' with regard to a specific set of properties that distinguishes them statistically from a majority of other flakes. Moreover, their attributes can be linked to factors that, based on current knowledge, are desirable features in flake tools (e.g. durability, capacity for retouch, and reduction of torque). As such, our results support the hypothesis that the lengthy, multi-phase, and hierarchically organized process of Levallois reduction was a deliberate, engineered strategy orientated toward specific goals. In turn, our results support suggestions that Levallois knapping relied on a cognitive capacity for long-term working memory. This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that cognitive distinctions between later Pleistocene hominins such as the Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans were not as sharp as some scholars have previously suggested. © 2012 Eren, Lycett.",,"article; controlled study; fossil hominin; materials testing; morphometrics; paleoanthropology; standardization; structure analysis; animal; archeology; biological model; classification; comparative study; histology; history; hominid; Homo neanderthalensis; human; instrumentation; kitchen; laboratory diagnosis; methodology; morphometrics; physiology; standard; tool use; validation study; weapon; Animals; Archaeology; Body Weights and Measures; Cooking and Eating Utensils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Biological; Neanderthals; Specimen Handling; Tool Use Behavior; Validation Studies as Topic; Weapons",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856112566

This three-dimensional technique is compared with conventional two-dimensional methods to investigate which methods capture morphological variation in the assemblage most comprehensively. Additionally, a set of experimentally produced bifacial tools are incorporated into the analyses to isolate the behavioral pattern underpinning identified variation in the archaeological assemblage. The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture. The intensity with which this strategy was applied seems to have been mediated by the availability of raw material that was suitable for the production of large bifacial tools. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Acheulian data set is based on previously published data with the addition here of a study of the handaxes from the site of Boxgrove, England. The MTA data set is based on four classic sites from southwest France with large handaxe collections. Both standard caliper-based morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis applied to coordinate data taken from digitized images of handaxes are used to assess shape. The result is that, contrary to expectations based on assumptions of evolving technological skill, handaxes in the MTA are as or more variable in shape than Acheulian ones. This variation is allometric in Acheulian handaxes, and is linked to resharpening from the tip down to the base, but is not related to size in the MTA samples. These results suggest that the goals and constraints of handaxe manufacture, but particularly handaxe reduction as a result of reworking during use, were quite different in the MTA and Acheulian, implying that conclusions about hominin cognition drawn from patterns in shape variability in handaxes must be understood in the context of artifact life histories. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Acheulian; Boxgrove; Elliptical Fourier analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Handaxe; Life-history; MTA; Shape variability","Acheulean; artifact; hominid; life history; morphometry; Paleolithic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956090095

The Aterian is defined by the presence of 'tanged' or 'stemmed' tools, which have been widely assumed to be among the earliest projectile weapon tips. The present study systematically investigates morphological variation in a large sample of Aterian tools to test the hypothesis that these tools were hafted and/or used as projectile weapons. Methodology/Principal Findings: Both classical morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis of tool outlines are used to show that the shape variation in the sample exhibits size-dependent patterns consistent with a reduction of the tools from the tip down, with the tang remaining intact. Additionally, the process of reduction led to increasing side-to-side asymmetries as the tools got smaller. Finally, a comparison of shape-change trajectories between Aterian tools and Late Paleolithic arrowheads from the North German site of Stellmoor reveal significant differences in terms of the amount and location of the variation. Conclusions/Significance: The patterns of size-dependent shape variation strongly support the functional hypothesis of Aterian tools as hafted knives or scrapers with alternating active edges, rather than as weapon tips. Nevertheless, the same morphological patterns are interpreted as one of the earliest evidences for a hafting modification, and for the successful combination of different raw materials (haft and stone tip) into one implement, in itself an important achievement in the evolution of hominin technologies. © 2011 Radu Iovita.",,"article; elliptical Fourier analysis; fossil hominin; Fourier analysis; materials; morphometrics; Paleolithic; projectile weapon; Stone Age; tool use; weapon; weight, mass and size; archeology; devices; human; Archaeology; Equipment and Supplies; Fourier Analysis; Humans",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84455192786

Since the emergence of the processual paradigma, this research has been partly based on the use of interpretive frameworks derived from ethnoarcheological sources. However, this approach is flawed by the lack of correspondence between the time scale of the ethnographic information and the time scale of the archeological record. This paper presents the lithic assemblage from level J (ca. 50 ka BP), one of the Middle Paleolithic layers excavated in the Abric Romaní (Capellades, Spain). The study of this assemblage has been carried out from a spatio-temporal perspective, trying to discern two different time scales involved in the formation of the archeological record: the geological time scale of the assemblage-as-a-whole and the ethnographic time scale of the individual events. The results suggest that several domains of lithic variability, like raw material provisioning, artifact transport and spatial patterns, are time-dependent and should be approached taking into account the temporal depth of the archeological assemblages. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeological evidence; artifact; ethnic group; lithic fragment; Paleolithic; social history; spatiotemporal analysis; timescale; Spain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84655168089

Several Paleolithic sites with lithic assemblages attributable to the Acheulean Industrial Complex (Mode 2) have yielded bifacial bone artifacts. Many of these bone implements are similar to classic handaxes in plan shape. The arbitrary imposition of form represented by these bone bifaces suggests the deliberate application of certain operational concepts that originate from particular Acheulean technological behaviors, namely, stone handaxe manufacture. In addition, the presence of these bone tools suggests an application of specific reductive techniques that originated in both Mode 1 (i.e., Oldowan) and Mode 2 (i.e., Acheulean) lithic technologies. How does the Acheulean model for stone biface shape compare to that observed for bone biface shape? In order to understand the degree to which Acheulean stone bifaces may have served as a model of form in flaked bone technology, an objective method for evaluating form is necessary. The dimensionless approach of geometric morphometrics was applied to the study of 2D bone and stone biface plan shape. The similarity of bone and stone bifaces from the Middle Pleistocene (∼300 kya) Acheulean site Castel di Guido, Latium, Italy was evaluated by a geometric morphometric analysis of 2D outlines. The null hypothesis that there is no difference in the 2D shape of each artifact material class was tested by principal component analysis (PCA) and MANOVA/CVA of eigenshape scores. Results of the analysis show no significant difference between the plan morphology of bone and stone bifaces. These results may indicate that Acheulean concepts of preferred 2D shape were applied in the production of some bifacial bone tools and that a great disparity in raw materials did not significantly influence 2D biface morphology. Furthermore, these results lend support to the idea that Mode 2 stone flaking techniques and tool types were directly applied to bone materials in some instances. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051798141

Despite the importance of the concept of symmetry to studies of early human development, its current use is usually based on loose qualitative assessment. A more informative approach would be to use a continuous scale of this shape property rather than the strict current language of ""more"" or ""less"". A symmetry measurement tool has been developed, which is based on evaluation of the minimal distances that the vertices of a structure have to move in order to attain the required symmetry. Using this Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) method, it is possible to evaluate quantitatively how much symmetry exists in a non-symmetrical configuration and how the nearest symmetrical shape looks. We test and demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of this approach on handaxe samples from three Lower Paleolithic sites in Israel, Ubeidiya, Gesher Benot Ya'aqov and Ma'ayan Barukh, representing various stages in the Acheulian Techno-complex of the Levant.

Levallois technology remains an important focus for research in Palaeolithic archaeology, yet quantitative morphological comparisons of Levallois core morphology from different regions remain rare. Here, utilizing Levallois cores from Africa, the Near East, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent, patterns of morphological variability in the shape of the Levallois flaking surface and core outline (margin) shape were examined for patterns of variability and stability across regions using 3D geometric morphometrics. The multivariate statistical shape analyses undertaken revealed a clear pattern: that is, the greatest levels of shape variability in Levallois cores is evident in the form of their outline (planform) shape. Conversely, the geometrical relationship between the margin of the Levallois cores and their topological surface morphology was relatively uniform. This pattern of variability was evident in terms of variation both across regions and between cores from the same locality. These results indicate that the outline form of such cores was a less important variable than the geometric/topological properties of the surface morphology and, in particular, the relationship between the margin of the core and those variables. These results have implications for why it has been reported that replicating such cores in modern experiments is a particularly difficult task. The specific interrelationship between the geometric properties of the core and the core margin provide further evidence that Levallois core technology would be unlikely to emerge from the context of opportunistic migrating platform reduction strategies (such as those seen in many Mode 1 industries). If, as is widely suggested, Levallois cores were deliberate products in Pleistocene contexts, these results also hint that relatively sophisticated means of social transmission (i.e. teaching) may have been required to sustain their production over time and space. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Core variation; Geometric morphometric analysis; Levallois","archaeological evidence; archaeology; geometry; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; technological development; Africa; Europe; India",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871442389

Assemblages are mainly studied using either linear distance measurements or qualitative assessments of morphologies. Here, we present a method to quantify morphological variability in lithic artifacts using 3D models of stone artifacts. Our study on the sequence of the Upper Paleolithic layers V-I from the site Yabroud II in western Syria, demonstrates that utilizing 3D models provides a new insight into the variability of lithic technologies. We use quantitative data on convexities, twist and scar patterns on cores and blades, attributes previously not readily quantifiable, to trace technological change through the archaeological sequence. We are able to identify differences and translate these findings into a grouping of the layers. While layers VI-II are characterized by technological continuity and were grouped together, layers V and I can be separated from this group and represent technologically different groups chronologically before and after. Our results demonstrate the potential of 3D models for studying morphological variability in lithic assemblages. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Levant; Lithic technology; Quantitative methods; Upper Paleolithic; Yabroud","archaeology; artifact; Paleolithic; technological change; three-dimensional modeling; Levant; Mediterranean Region; Syrian Arab Republic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865044023

This practice results in confusions when large-scale assemblage comparisons are made with the aim of investigating phylogenetic relationships, as functional and cultural information is aggregated. It is argued here that functional criteria must be assessed separately, and that resharpening, as a uniform, repeated, conscious behavioral process of tool maintenance that indexes use and function, can provide a solution to this problem. The subject of this article is a quantitative method for extracting and comparing resharpening trajectories. The method is an adaptation of ontogenetic scaling methods from biology, and is based on obtaining a mathematical representation of shape and size, and finding a relationship between the two. Elliptical Fourier analysis is applied to stone tool contours in order to extract shape information, and then a series of regressions of shape on size provide trajectory vectors. The angles between these are then calculated and subjected to a variety of multivariate statistical tests. A case study involving several European Middle Paleolithic bifacial and unifacial tool assemblages is presented. The results show that resharpening and maintenance can be independent of morphology and technology, suggesting that there are strong grounds for focusing on functional systematics separately. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Bearing in mind the temporal issues involved in the interpretation of archeological assemblages, we have organized this chapter according to two different analytical levels. On the one hand, we have studied the technological and functional characteristics of the assemblage-as-a-whole, paying special attention to raw material provisioning, knapping strategies and tool manufacture. Raw material provisioning was basically local, although the nearest materials were not the most exploited. Core reduction strategies show a high variability due to the dominance of expedient criteria aimed at the production of small flakes. Finally, tool manufacture was characterized by the clear dominance of denticulates and notches, which were used at different tasks, but especially at hideworking. On the other hand, the second analytical level is focused on the event level and tryes to identify as much single technical episodes as possible. This approach is based on refitting and the identification of Raw Material Units. The spatial distribution of these events allows discussing the temporal dynamics in the formation of the lithic assemblages, highlighting the time-dependent nature of assemblage variability. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Denticulate; Discoidal method; Lithic analysis; Raw material provisioning; Raw material unit; Refitting; Use-wear",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923563845

This new method of flake production was accompanied by significant behavioral changes in hominin populations. The emergence of this technological advance is considered homogeneous in the European archaeological record at the Marine isotopic stage (MIS) 9/MIS 8 boundary. In this paper we report a series of combined electron spin resonance/U-series dates on mammal bones and teeth recovered from the lower units of San Bernardino Cave (Italy) and the technological analyses of the lithic assemblages. The San Bernardino Cave has yielded the earliest evidence of Levallois production on the Italian Peninsula recovered to date. In addition to our results and the review of the archaeological record, we describe the chronological and geographical differences between European territories and diversities in terms of technological developments. The belated emergence of Levallois technology in Italy compared to western Europe corresponds to the late Italian Neanderthal speciation event.

The least complicated hypothesis is that they were intended to arm hunting weapons. It has also been argued that they were produced for use in rituals or in connection with costly signaling displays. Lastly, it has been suggested that some cached Clovis points may have been used as saws. Here we report a study in which we morphometrically compared Clovis points from caches with Clovis points recovered from kill and camp sites to test two predictions of the hypothesis that cached Clovis points were intended to arm hunting weapons: 1) cached points should be the same shape as, but generally larger than, points from kill/camp sites, and 2) cached points and points from kill/camp sites should follow the same allometric trajectory. The results of the analyses are consistent with both predictions and therefore support the hypothesis. A follow-up review of the fit between the results of the analyses and the predictions of the other hypotheses indicates that the analyses support only the hunting equipment hypothesis.

In contrast, evidence of human processing of small animals and carnivores is very scarce in this chronology. In Level O of the Abric Romaní site, dated to 55ka, various evidence of human activity has been identified in Cervus elaphus, Bos primigenius and Equus ferus, but also in Felis silvestris. The present paper focuses on the specific case of this felid. The main aim is to explain the anthropogenic use of the wildcat, taking into account actualistic and archaeological studies. An analysis is undertaken of skeletal part representation, surface modifications (cutmarks), bone breakage pattern (one or both epiphyses missing from certain limb bones) and the spatial dispersion of the remains (clustered and unevenly distributed). The results indicate that all the remains belong to a nearly complete individual that was processed and consumed by Neanderthals inside the rock shelter. This case is compared with the other taxa identified in Level O, with other carnivores recovered from the Abric Romaní site and with other sites with a similar chronology. It is suggested that Neanderthals had a more diverse diet and more variable subsistence strategies than previously thought. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeology; chronology; diet; felid; human activity; Neanderthal; skeletal remains; taxonomy; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Animalia; Bos primigenius; Cervus elaphus; Equus ferus; Felidae; Felis silvestris; Ungulata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897062895

They are thus of prime importance to understand better human behaviors of this region. However, they are typo-technologically difficult to characterize and consist mainly of informal flakes. This paper presents an innovative approach focusing on form and function to better assess the prehistoric use of stone tools in the region using a sample of flakes from the cave of Song Terus, Java, Indonesia. The integration of morphological description, usewear and morphometric analysis (Elliptical Fourier Analysis) allows a detailed characterization of tool use not possible with other methods. We demonstrate that a specific form of stone flake is not related to a particular function and vice versa. Our results show that tool production was not oriented towards the production of flakes of specific form, or to the production of flake blanks that could be modified by retouch but was a system where the control of flake shape was relaxed in favor of the selection of flakes suitable for particular tasks either during reduction or once core reduction had concluded. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Elliptical Fourier Analysis; Form; Function; Indonesia; Morphometry; Plant; Song Terus; Southeast Asia; Stone flake; Usewear",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888292444

First, we will present the basic information concerning the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the Capellades region, which are fundamental to understand site formation. We will summarize the history of the archeological excavations carried out at the Abric Romaní, since the discovery of the site in 1909 to the current works. This history shows the different theoretical and methodological paradigms that dominated European Prehistory in the course of the twentieth century. Within this context, the excavation of level J will be exposed in detail. Finally, we will present the stratigraphy of the site and the chronological framework, which is largely based on U/Th dating of tufas. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Abric Romaní; Capellades; Chronology; Geology; Research history; Stratigraphy",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015789342

This procedure has facilitated the exchange of information between separate researchers and has improved the comparison of different assemblages. In these classifications, denticulates and notched tools have been regularly interpreted as analogues and chronologically unvaried in different and vast territories. Based on the definitions developed by Bordes, the denticulate category has become a catchall for any kind of tool bearing concavities. In this paper a new quantitative approach to the classification of denticulates and notched tools is proposed. The new methodology is based on measuring the length of notches and their distribution on the perimeter of the blank. Analyzing the lithic series of the Abric Romaní rock-shelter (Spain) and Grotta Maggiore di San Bernardino (Italy) led to the identification of 11 redundant forms: eight denticulates and three notched tools. Moreover, the application of Kuhn's Geometric Index of Unifacial Reduction brought local manufacturing trends to light, calling into question the presumed geographical uniformity of these categories of artifacts. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Denticulate; Lithic typology; Middle Paleolithic; Notched tool; Tool resharpening","archaeology; artifact; Mousterian; tool use; typology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650311108

This river passes by the Capellades locality, forming a narrow gorge known as “Cinglera del Capelló”. This corridor crosses the mountain range “Cordillera Prelitoral”, and is considered as a natural passage between the inland and coastal Catalonia regions. This situation provides the possibility to exploit a great variety of biotopes. The site yielded an important and complete stratigraphic sequence of European Middle Paleolithic. Fifteen archeological levels have been excavated until today, which appear as thin layers between sterile travertine platforms. This sequence has been dated by U-series between 70 and 40 ka BP, except for the uppermost level, which is attributed to the Early Upper Paleolithic. Pollen analyses have revealed five climatic phases, ranging from the milder conditions at the bottom to an interstadial climate at the top, correlated with the Hengelo interstadial. It is, consequently, a key site for human behavioral studies among Neanderthal groups. This paper presents the results of studies on resource procurements, lithics and animals and on the territory used by Neanderthal groups, through the example of level M dated around 55 ka BP. The results of the lithic analysis and faunal assemblages suggest that the resource procurement and management is focused on a local and semi-local exploitation in a geographic area of about 20 km around the rock-shelter. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Faunal assemblages; Lithic technology; Middle Paleolithic; Resource management",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855864943

The site has a long stratigraphical sequence representing a short chronology, but we focused on levels K, L, and M. The study of seasonality in ungulates indicates that the game was hunted at different periods of the year in each level. Combination of zooarchaeological analyses shows that in all levels the pattern of game procurement and transport to the shelter is similar. In the same way, there is no significant difference related to animal processing. The carcasses introduced into the shelter are used in an exhaustive and systematic way. Although seasonality in the occupation are changing, there are no significant differences in the activities of the Neanderthal groups in the three levels. We conclude that the presence of Neanderthals at Abric Romaní is highly seasonal and their displacements are strongly conditioned by the presence of game preys in the territory.","Late pleistocene; Middle paleolithic; Neanderthal behaviour; Seasonality; Zooarchaeology","archaeological evidence; depositional sequence; fauna; food processing; human activity; human behavior; hunting; hypothesis testing; Neanderthal; paleoenvironment; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; seasonality; stratigraphic correlation; ungulate; zoology; Spain; Animalia; Ungulata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953948177

These two sites are located in the South-eastern Pyrenees in Catalunya (Spain) and yield Mousterian levels which are attributed to MIS 3 and MIS 5. At the two studied sites, there is coexistence between expedient knapping systems and more complex techniques such as the Levallois method. Furthermore, cores are heavily exhausted, showing a pattern that cannot be explained by the absence or scarcity of raw material. This technical pattern can be traced across several Mousterian assemblages in the South-eastern Pyrenees, suggesting technocognitive continuity in the Middle Palaeolithic during the Upper Pleistocene, in which changes in lithic reduction patterns are not evident.

The shells have been analysed with regard to outline shape (Fourier shape analysis), dimensions, ornamentation (Arcumytilus) and ligament arrangement (Isognomon). Additionally, data on co-occurring fauna and palaeotemperatures calculated from δ18O values have been recorded. The results of the morphometric analyses have been interpreted with regard to phytogeny and palaeoecology. In all target taxa, a distinct, rapid size increase at around the Early/Late Kimmeridgian boundary is evident. Potential causes for this process are discussed, and an increase in food availability is regarded the most likely scenario. In Isognomon rugosus, a distinct change in resilifer arrangement co-occurs with size increase, resulting in the evolution of an endemic species in the Lusitanian Basin, for which the name Isognomon lusitanicus is re-established. Like in several extant Mytilidae, morphological species characterisation in Arcomytilus turns out unsatisfactory, due to high intra-specific variability. However, Arcomytilus morrisii is still regarded as a valid species that evolved in the Lusitanian Basin. Despite high shape variability, Eomiodon securiformis is also considered to be a clearly distinguished species. For all target taxa morphologic variability is discussed with regard to environment, and variation between populations is delineated. The data suggest a weak correlation of facies and shell shape in Arcomytilus, while Isognomon lusitanicus seems to develop local varieties in different subbasins. Finally, the great morphologic plasticity of bivalves from rather distinct systematic entities is shown to result from different causes, thus demonstrating that careful studies of the involved species are a prerequisite to draw correct palaeoecological conclusions.","Bivalvia; ecophenotypy; Fourier shape analysis; Late Jurassic; morphometry; Portugal; size increase","abundance; bivalve; fauna; Jurassic; Kimmeridgian; morphometry; taxonomy; Atlantic Ocean; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lusitanian Basin; Portugal; Bivalvia; Isognomon; Mytilidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650504632

Before drawing any behavioural or environmental inferences from the archaeological record, researchers must identify the taphonomic agents and mechanisms that have modified faunal assemblages. In this paper, post-depositional alterations of the faunal remains in the level O of the Abric Romaní site, dated around 55 ky, are investigated. As with other levels of this site studied previously, the origin of the macrofaunal accumulations in level O and the major taphonomic modifications within this level are due to human activity. After human occupation, however, post-depositional taphonomic processes occurred including carnivore damage, plant activity, water abrasion, rodent activity, cementation and manganese oxide pigmentation. In the present study we focus on post-depositional processes paying particular attention to the number of affected remains, degree of alteration, the sequence of modifications, skeletal part representation and spatial distribution of the remains. Our study concludes that the level O had a microenvironment of relative ambient humidity, marked by wet conditions and reactivations of weak water flows. In general, post-depositional processes were not highly destructive, which is conducive to the study of the faunal remains from an archaeological point of view. © 2012 E.

The successive Jurassic ammonoid faunas of southern Germany show characteristic patterns in morphospace occupation. While Early and Middle Jurassic ammonoids occupy limited areas of the morphospace range, the Late Jurassic ammonoids cover the entire spectrum. The ammonoids are characterised by an overall increase of both taxonomic diversity and morphological disparity in the course of the Jurassic. Strong fluctuations occur until the middle Late Jurassic, followed by a diversity decrease in the early Kimmeridgian and a disparity reduction in the early Tithonian. While diversity and disparity show similar progression during most of the Early Jurassic, they diverge subsequently and show only poor correlation until the end of the Jurassic. Particularly in the Middle Jurassic diversity and sea level changes correlate strongly. Neither temporal patterns in diversity nor disparity support the hypothesis of a mass extinction event in the early Toarcian. Significant changes in diversity and disparity in the early Callovian support a putative migration event of Boreal ammonoids into the Tethyan realm. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Past treatments of the topic suffer from an inadequate definition of the concept of ""standardization"" and a scarcity of quantitative comparisons of morphological variation. Ranges of variation in the sizes and shapes of Middle and Lower Paleolithic artifacts from several sites are compared using a bootstrapping method. These comparisons illustrate how variables related to the basic technological constraints of working isotropic stone and the fracture qualities of particular raw materials may lead to the appearance of differential standardization. Because they are influenced by so many factors, artifact forms may be less informative about technological ""design"" among ancient hominins than are phenomena such as core reduction and raw material exploitation. © 2010 by University Press of Colorado.
