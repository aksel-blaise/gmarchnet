As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

We illustrate the application of Procrustes superimposition to visually examine the concordance of observations for each dimension separately and how to conduct hypothesis testing in which the association between two data sets is tested while controlling for the variation related to other sources of data. Our simulation results show that PROTEST is as powerful or more powerful than the Mantel test for detecting matrix association under a variety of possible scenarios.

One contributory tradition is the multivariate analysis of covariance matrices originally developed as biometrics and now dominant across a broad expanse of applied statistics. This approach, couched solely in the linear geometry of covariance structures, ignores biomathematical aspects of the original measurements. The other tributary emphasizes the direct visualization of changes in biological form. However, making objective the biological meaning of the features seen in those diagrams was always problematical; also, the representation of variation, as distinct from pairwise difference, proved infeasible. To combine these two variants of biomathematical modeling into a valid praxis for quantitative studies of biological shape was a goal earnestly sought though most of this century. That goal was finally achieved in the 1980s when techniques from mathematical statistics, multivariate biometrics, non-Euclidean geometry and computer graphics were combined in a coherent new system of tools for the complete regionalized quantitative analysis of landmark points together with the biomedical images in which they are seen. In this morphometric synthesis, correspondence of landmarks (biologically labeled geometric points, like ""bridge of the nose"") across specimens is taken as a biomathematical primitive. The shapes of configurations of landmarks are defined as equivalence classes with respect to the Euclidean similarity group and then represented as single points in David Kendall's shape space, a Riemannian manifold with Procrustes distance as metric. All conventional multivariate strategies carry over to the study of shape variation and covariation when shapes are interpreted in the tangent space to the shape manifold at an average shape. For biomathematical interpretation of such analyses, one needs a basis for the tangent space compatible with the reality of local biotheoretical processes and explanations at many different geometric scales, and one needs graphics for visualizing average shape differences and other statistical contrasts there. Both of these needs are managed by the thin-plate spline, a deformation function that has an unusually helpful linear algebra. The spline also links the biometrics of landmarks to deformation analysis of the images from which the landmarks originally arose. This article reviews the history and principal tools of this synthesis in their biomathematical and biometrical context and demonstrates their usefulness in a study of focal neuroanatomical anomalies in schizophrenia.",,"anatomy; animal; article; biometry; computer graphics; human; mathematics; methodology; theoretical model; Anatomy; Animals; Biometry; Computer Graphics; Humans; Mathematics; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030095282

There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups. We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15 with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5 h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed from the unexposed in this sample.

Power surfaces are computed with emphasis on the simplest case of three points in the plane (i.e., landmarks at the vertices of a triangle). Goodall's ([1991] J Roy Stat Soc Serb 53:285-339) F-test was found to have the highest power followed by T2-tests using Kendall tangent space coordinates. Power for T2- tests using Bookstein shape coordinates was good if the baseline was not the shortest side of the triangle. The Rao and Suryawanshi ([1996] Proc Natl Acad Sci 93:12132-12136 and [1998] Proc Natl Acad Sci 95:4121-4125) shape variables had much lower power when triangles were not close to being equilateral. Power surfaces for the EDMA-I T statistic revealed very low power for many shape comparisons including those between very different shapes. Power surface for the EDMA-II Z statistic were also complicated and depended strongly on the choice of baseline used for size scaling. The type I error rate was also often not correct for this method. Results for more than three landmarks are also presented. The implications of the results for practical applications of morphometrics are discussed.

(1) Given an ordination of points representing specimens or species in morphological space, morphological disparity of the entire group is measured as the average squared distance of points from the centroid. The contribution that a subgroup makes to morphological disparity is measured as the average squared distance of its points from the overall centroid (not the subgroup centroid), weighted by the subgroup sample size relative to the total group sample size. Thus, morphological disparity of a group can be additively partitioned into the disparity components of its subgroups, and the relative contributions of these subgroups can be assessed quantitatively. (2) An alternative approach is to compare morphological disparity of a group to the disparity it would have if a certain subgroup were omitted. If the resulting disparity differs substantially from the original disparity, then the subgroup in question is considered to have a significant effect on morphological disparity. Because some subgroups are very centralized in morphological space, omitting them can cause an increase in morphological disparity when disparity is measured as the average dissimilarity among species. In general, relatively large subgroups that are located peripherally in morphospace make the greatest contributions to morphological disparity, and failure to sample smaller groups often has little effect on disparity estimates. The two methods are applied to morphological disparity in trilobites, partitioned at different levels in the taxonomic hierarchy. Results of the two methods are intuitively reasonable and largely in agreement, and point to the predominance of Early Cambrian olenelloids, Cambro-Ordovician Libristoma, Ordovician Asaphina and Cheirurina, Siluro-Devonian Phacopida and Phacopina, and Devonian Proetida. © 1993, Paleontological Society.

Two of these samples are artificially deformed (anteroposterior [AP] and circumferential [C] types). Measurements taken from lateral radiographs demonstrated that alternative forms of the cranial base angle (N‐S‐Ba, planum angle, planum sphenoidale to plane of the clivus and PANG angle, planum sphenoidale to basion‐sella plane) and the orbital and OANG angles (orbital roof to plane of the clivus and basion‐sella plane, respectively) of both deformed groups increased while the angle S‐Ba‐O decreased significantly with respect to the undeformed (N) sample. Changes in the AP group are largely due to anteroinferior displacement of the basion‐sella plane. Similar changes in group C are amplified by this group's posterosuperior frontal migration. This migration results in a relatively shallow orbit at the orbital plate/frontal squama interface. Unlike the deformation experienced by the external vault plates, the basion‐sella plane orientation remains stable with respect to the Frankfort Horizontal. Additionally, nasal region measurements such as maximum nasal aperture breadth and nasal height were largely stable between each deformed group and the undeformed group. However, facial (bimaxillary and bizygomatic), basicranial, cranial, and frontal breadths decreased significantly from group AP to group N to group C. Thus, gross morphological facial changes between each undeformed group and the control group are largely accounted for by dimensional changes in peripheral structures. These results stress the importance of the dynamic interrelationship between the cranial vault and base in the development of the craniofacial complex.

We test the hypothesis that fronto‐occipital artificial reshaping of the neurocranial vault results in specific changes in the cranial base and face. Fronto‐occipital reshaping results from the application of pads or a cradle board which constrains cranial vault growth, limiting growth between the frontal and occipital and allowing compensatory growth of the parietals in a mediolateral direction. Two skeletal series including both normal and artificially modified crania are analyzed, a prehistoric Peruvian Ancon sample (47 normal, 64 modified crania) and a Songish Indian sample from British Columbia (6 normal, 4 modified). Three‐dimensional coordinates of 53 landmarks were measured with a diagraph and used to form 9 finite elements as a prelude to finite element scaling analysis. Finite element scaling was used to compare average normal and modified crania and the results were evaluated for statistical significance using a bootstrap test. Fronto‐occipitally reshaped Ancon crania are significantly different from normal in the vault, cranial base, and face. The vault is compressed along an anterior‐superior to posterior‐inferior axis and expanded along a mediolateral axis in modified individuals. The cranial base is wider and shallower in the modified crania in the face is foreshortened and wider with the anterior orbital rim moving inferior and posterior towards the cranial base. The Songish crania display a different modification of the vault and face, indicating that important differences may exist in the morphological effects of fronto‐occipital reshaping from one group to another. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

A review of ethnohistorical sources in conjunction with a human osteological study of cranial shape modification offers original data regarding diversity in Tiwanaku society, which was situated in the southern Andes from ca. AD 500-1100. The study sample includes 412 individuals from the site of Tiwanaku, surrounding sites in the Tiwanaku and Katari valleys, and Tiwanaku-affiliated sites in the Moquegua valley of southern Peru. A distinct regional pattern is clear in the ways in which head form was modified. In the Moquegua valley, solely fronto-occipital modification was employed, while in the Katari valley a distinctly different, annular modification was practiced. In contrast, individuals interred in the capital city of Tiwanaku displayed both head form styles. These results suggest that diverse groups of people from neighboring areas were drawn to the Tiwanaku capital in the highlands, and cranial shape modification was involved in symbolic boundary maintenance at the juncture of two distinct environmental niches, the precise location of the capital site of Tiwanaku. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J. Phys. Anthropol. 79:253-267; Kohn et al. [1993] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 90:147-158). It can be argued that diverging observations partly result from methodological constraints. The present study compares samples of intentionally deformed and undeformed human crania, using elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA), a morphometric approach which has been shown to be particularly appropriate for characterizing the shape of two-dimensional outlines and associated shape changes. We improve the standard EFA approach by adding a preliminary orientation of the outlines following the rotation parameters of a Procrustes superimposition, using multiple homologous landmarks called control points. The results confirm that circumferentially deformed skulls exhibit modifications of the basioccipital region, together with increased anterior and inferior facial projection. However, the degree to which basioccipital flattening is modified in circumferentially deformed Peruvians was found to be less marked than changes observed in the face. Some of the modifications observed here can be related to morphological trends existing in the population from which our sample was taken. The observation of other modifications may be subject to methodological constraints of standard morphometric approaches. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Homologous control points; Intentional deformation; Outline analysis; Procrustes registration","article; elliptic fourier analysis; face malformation; finite element analysis; Fourier analysis; human; morphometrics; Peru; skull base; skull malformation; Adult; American Native Continental Ancestry Group; Anthropology, Physical; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Fourier Analysis; Humans; Male; Reference Values; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041418176

We test the hypothesis that, in addition to its direct effects on the cranial vault, annular cranial vault modification has a significant indirect effect on cranial base and facial morphology. Two skeletal series from the Pacific Northwest Coast, which include both nonmodified and modified crania, were used: the Kwakiutl (62 nonmodified, 45 modified) and Nootka (28 nonmodified, 20 modified). Three‐dimensional coordinates of 53 landmarks were obtained using a diagraph, and 36 landmarks were used to define nine finite elements in the cranial vault, cranial base, and face. Finite element scaling was used to compare average nonmodified and average modified crania, and the significance of the results were evaluated using a bootstrap test. Annular modification of the cranial vault produces significant effects on the morphology of the cranial base and face. Annular modification in the Kwakiutl resulted in restrictions of the cranial vault in the medial‐lateral and superior‐inferior dimensions and an increase in anterior‐posterior growth. Similar dimensional changes are observed in the cranial base. The Kwakiutl face is increased anterior‐posteriorly and reduced anterior‐laterally to posterior‐medially. Similar effects of modification are observed in the Nootka cranial vault and cranial base, though not in the face. These results demonstrate the developmental interdependence of the cranial vault, cranial base, and face. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Four hundred and fifteen skulls, representing a period of 7000 years, were examined of which 88.9 per cent were deformed. The practice was carried out equally between men and women. The techniques used in head deforming varied over time among the different cultural groups that inhabited the region. By analysis of the methods used in ACD, it can be demonstrated that head deforming may yield information significant to the study of the political and cultural changes that occurred throughout the prehistory of the region. As a form of stylistic behaviour, which may be viewed as a strategy of information exchange, ACD was found to be a significant cultural artifact that may serve to mark territory or social boundaries, reaffirm ethnicity, and maintain and strengthen exchange networks. Certain pathological consequences were found to be the result of ACD, including an increase in the prevalence of wormian bones, occipital bone necrosis, and an abnormal closing pattern of the cranial sutures. No evidence was found that ACD is associated with a deviated nasal septum or osteomas of the external auditory canal.

We hypothesize that the underlying scale which determines the presence or absence of a cranial non‐metric trait is an expression of general and/or local size variation in the cranium. Therefore metric and non‐metric traits will share a common developmental determination. The hypothesis implies that the underlying scale of a non‐metric trait will be correlated with measures of cranial size and shape. Forty‐eight cranial metric and twenty‐five cranial non‐metric traits were scored on the left side of adult male crania from four North American Indian populations. New threshold traits were generated for each non‐metric trait by dichotomizing discriminant scores produced by discriminant function analysis. The discriminant analysis was performed using metric traits to discriminate between groups formed by non‐metric trait presence or absence. Every non‐metric trait tested was significantly correlated with its threshold trait in at least one population. The correlations were of moderate to high levels depending on the trait and population sample studied. This implies that metric and non‐metric traits share a moderate to high degree of developmental determination. The cause of these correlations may lie in the common effects that growth and development of the soft tissue and functional spaces of the cranium exert on both metric and non‐metric traits.

However, artificial vault deformation has been suggested to be the cause of 'archaic' characters such as frontal recession in key fossil Australian crania. We use log-log plots of cranial arc versus chord measurements and we score nonmetric traits often thought to be associated with artificial deformation to make systematic comparisons across groups and deformation types to identify universal consequences of artificial deformation. Based on our large comparative sample (n=588) apparatus-deformed crania have flatter frontals and occipitals and usually more angulated parietals in the sagittal plane than undeformed crania, regardless of deformation type. Fossil Australian samples exhibit evidence of both undeformed and deformed individuals. The sample from Coobool Creek provides evidence that undeformed individuals had more rounded frontals than recent Australians. However, many individuals from Coobool Creek, Kow Swamp, and Nacurrie exhibit modification of one or more cranial contours. The Kow Swamp individuals in particular plot with deformed crania from all regions. In addition, the frequency of hyperostotic traits such as bregmatic eminence, metopic and sagittal keels in H. sapiens is influenced by both artificial deformation and pathological hypervascularity/hyperostosis. Thus it is unwise to use cranial contours and these nonmetric traits to infer genetic relatedness between Fossil Australians and Indonesian H. erectus.","Cranial contours; Homo erectus; Origin of H. sapiens","cranium; evolution; Australia; Indonesia; Animalia; Crania; Hominidae; Homo erectus; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033081055

Discriminant function analysis is used to study the metric differences between macaque crania grouped according to the presence or absence of nine nonmetric traits. The computation of total structure coefficients from the discriminant function analyses provides information regarding how closely each metric variable is related to the discriminant functions derived. Total structure coefficients have not been used previously in the study of the relationship between metric and nonmetric traits. The results of the analysis are interpreted using an explicit approach to cranial morphogenesis—functional cranial analysis. It is concluded that the relationship between cranial metric and nonmetric traits is explicable in terms of a common developmental pathway shared by the two types of traits. Identification of the specific etiology of nonmetric traits depends on future anatomical studies of organisms throughout the period of nonmetric trait development.
