Morphometric studies most often use the arrangements of morphological landmarks as the data source and extract shape information from them by Procrustes superimposition. The MorphoJ software combines this approach with a wide range of methods for shape analysis in different biological contexts. The program offers an integrated and user-friendly environment for standard multivariate analyses such as principal components, discriminant analysis and multivariate regression as well as specialized applications including phylogenetics, quantitative genetics and analyses of modularity in shape data.

Eleven statistical techniques are evaluated in reference to one broadly interspecific data set (craniometries of adult Old World monkeys) and one narrowly intraspecific data set (anthropometries of adult Native American males). Three different types of residuals are compared to three versions of shape ratios, and these are contrasted to “cscores,” Penrose shape, and multivariate adjustments based on the first principal component of the logged variance‐covariance matrix; all methods are also compared to raw and logged raw data. In order to help us identify appropriate; methods for size‐adjustment, geometrically similar or “isometric” versions of the male vervet and the Inuit male were created by scalar multiplication of all variables. The geometric mean of all variables is used as overall “size” throughout this investigation, but our conclusions would be the same for most other size variables. Residual adjustments failed to correctly identify individuals of the same shape in both sampkles. Like residuals, cscores are also sample‐specific and incorrectly attribute different shape values to individuals known to be identical in shape. Multivariate “residuals” (e.g., discarding the first principal component and Burnaby's method) are plagued by similar problems. If one of the goals of an analysis is to identify individuals (OTUs) of the same shape after accounting for overalll size differences, then none of these methods can be recommended. We also reject the assertion that size‐adjusted variables should be unciorrelated with size of “size‐free”; rather, whether or not shape covaries with size is an important empirical determination in any analysis. Without explicit similarity criteria, “lines of subtraction” can be very misleading. Only variables in the Mosimann family of shape rations allowed us to identify sized individuals of the same shape (“Iso‐OUTs”). Residuals from isometric lines in logarithmic space, projections of logged data to a plane orthogonal to an isometric vector, and Penrose shape distance based on logged data are also part of this shape family. Shape defined in this manner can be significantly correlated with size in allometric data sets (e.g., guenon craniometrics); ratio shape differences may be largely independent of size in narrowly intraspecific or intrasexual data sets (e.g., Native American anthropometrics). Log‐transformations of shape variables are not always necessary or desirable. We hope our findings enciourage other workers to question the assumptions and utility of residuals as size‐adjusted data and to explore shape and relative size within Mosimann's explicitly geometric framework. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

From where did they come and what routes did they take? These questions have gripped scientists for decades, but until recently answers have proven difficult to find. Current genetic evidence implies dispersal from a single Siberian population toward the Bering Land Bridge no earlier than about 30,000 years ago (and possibly after 22,000 years ago), then migration from Beringia to the Americas sometime after 16,500 years ago. The archaeological records of Siberia and Beringia generally support these findings, as do archaeological sites in North and South America dating to as early as 15,000 years ago.

however, central questions remain unresolved. One contentious issue is whether the settlement occurred by means of a single migration or multiple streams of migration from Siberia. The pattern of dispersals within the Americas is also poorly understood. To address these questions at a higher resolution than was previously possible, we assembled data from 52 Native American and 17 Siberian groups genotyped at 364,470 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Here we show that Native Americans descend from at least three streams of Asian gene flow. Most descend entirely from a single ancestral population that we call First American. However, speakers of Eskimog-Aleut languages from the Arctic inherit almost half their ancestry from a second stream of Asian gene flow, and the Na-Dene-speaking Chipewyan from Canada inherit roughly one-tenth of their ancestry from a third stream. We show that the initial peopling followed a southward expansion facilitated by the coast, with sequential population splits and little gene flow after divergence, especially in South America.

However, additional details about the intial colonization of the Americas remain unclear. To investigate the pioneering phase in the Americas we analyzed a total of 623 complete mtDNAs from the Americas and Asia, including 20 new complete mtDNAs from the Americas and seven from Asia. This sequence data was used to direct high-resolution genotyping from 20 American and 26 Asian populations. Here we describe more genetic diversity within the founder population than was previously reported. The newly resolved phylogenetic structure suggests that ancestors of Native Americans paused when they reached Beringia, during which time New World founder lineages differentiated from their Asian sister-clades. This pause in movement was followed by a swift migration southward that distributed the founder types all the way to South America. The data also suggest more recent bi-directional gene flow between Siberia and the North American Arctic. © 2007 Tamm et al.",,"mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial DNA; American Indian; article; Asia; controlled study; gene flow; gene sequence; genetic variability; genotype; geographic distribution; haplotype; human; phylogeography; population migration; South America; Western Hemisphere; American Indian; genetics; mutation; phylogeny; Asia; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genotype; Haplotypes; Humans; Indians, North American; Mutation; Phylogeny",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-39749105082

Although Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians, there is no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to. Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania from the First Americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First Americans. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"mitochondrial DNA; anatomy; chromosome; divergence; ethnic group; genetic analysis; genome; human evolution; hunter-gatherer; Mesolithic; morphology; Paleolithic; population structure; American Indian; article; DNA damage; gene flow; gene frequency; human; human genome; Mesolithic; mitochondrial genome; Paleolithic; priority journal; Russian Federation; single nucleotide polymorphism; Y chromosome; American Indian; animal; Asia; Asian continental ancestry group; Caucasian; classification; ethnology; genetics; haplotype; human genome; male; migration; phylogeny; phylogeography; skeleton; Malta; Crania; Animals; Asia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Chromosomes, Human, Y; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; European Continental Ancestry Group; Gene Flow; Genome, Human; Genome, Mitochondrial; Haplotypes; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Siberia; Skeleton",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892367625

Just when and how they did so has been one of the most perplexing and controversial questions in archaeology. This dazzling, cutting-edge synthesis, written for a wide audience by an archaeologist who has long been at the center of these debates, tells the scientific story of the first Americans: where they came from, when they arrived, and how they met the challenges of moving across the vast, unknown landscapes of Ice Age North America. David J. Meltzer pulls together the latest ideas from archaeology, geology, linguistics, skeletal biology, genetics, and other fields to trace the breakthroughs that have revolutionized our understanding in recent years. Among many other topics, he explores disputes over the hemisphere's oldest and most controversial sites and considers how the first Americans coped with changing global climates. He also confronts some radical claims: that the Americas were colonized from Europe or that a crashing comet obliterated the Pleistocene megafauna. Full of entertaining descriptions of on-site encounters, personalities, and controversies, this is a compelling behind-the-scenes account of how science is illuminating our past. © 2009 by the Regents of the University of California.",,,Book,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887856379

Nearly 50 years of archaeological research point to the Clovis complex as having developed south of the North American ice sheets from an ancestral technology. However, both the origins and the genetic legacy of the people who manufactured Clovis tools remain under debate. It is generally believed that these people ultimately derived from Asia and were directly related to contemporary Native Americans. An alternative, Solutrean, hypothesis posits that the Clovis predecessors emigrated from southwestern Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum. Here we report the genome sequence of a male infant (Anzick-1) recovered from the Anzick burial site in western Montana. The human bones date to 10,705 ± 35 14 C years bp (approximately 12,707-12,556 calendar years bp) and were directly associated with Clovis tools. We sequenced the genome to an average depth of 14.4× and show that the gene flow from the Siberian Upper Palaeolithic Mal'ta population into Native American ancestors is also shared by the Anzick-1 individual and thus happened before 12,600 years bp. We also show that the Anzick-1 individual is more closely related to all indigenous American populations than to any other group. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that Anzick-1 belonged to a population directly ancestral to many contemporary Native Americans. Finally, we find evidence of a deep divergence in Native American populations that predates the Anzick-1 individual. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, the precise time and mode of the colonization of the New World remain hotly disputed issues. Native American populations exhibit almost exclusively five mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups (A-D and X). Haplogroups A-D are also frequent in Asia, suggesting a northeastern Asian origin of these lineages. However, the differential pattern of distribution and frequency of haplogroup X led some to suggest that it may represent an independent migration to the Americas. Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Native American haplogroups, including haplogroup X, were part of a single founding population, thereby refuting multiple-migration models. A detailed demographic history of the mtDNA sequences estimated with a Bayesian coalescent method indicates a complex model for the peopling of the Americas, in which the initial differentiation from Asian populations ended with a moderate bottleneck in Beringia during the last glacial maximum (LGM), around ∼23,000 to ∼19,000 years ago. Toward the end of the LGM, a strong population expansion started ∼18,000 and finished ∼15,000 years ago. These results support a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World, suggesting a rapid settlement of the continent along a Pacific coastal route. © 2008 The American Society of Human Genetics.",,"mitochondrial DNA; article; Asia; controlled study; DNA sequence; genomics; human; migration; mitochondrial genetics; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; population genetics; priority journal; United States; American Indian; genetics; genomics; haplotype; migration; phylogeny; Western Hemisphere; American Native Continental Ancestry Group; Americas; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Genomics; Haplotypes; Humans; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149133334

Using ancient and modern genome-wide data, we found that the ancestors of all present-day Native Americans, including Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago (ka) and after no more than an 8000-year isolation period in Beringia. After their arrival to the Americas, ancestral Native Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches around 13 ka, one that is now dispersed across North and South America and the other restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow resulted in some Native Americans sharing ancestry with present-day East Asians (including Siberians) and, more distantly, Australo-Melanesians. Putative ""Paleoamerican"" relict populations, including the historical Mexican Pericúes and South American Fuego-Patagonians, are not directly related to modern Australo-Melanesians as suggested by the Paleoamerican Model. © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Proponents of multiple migration models have claimed that patterns of variation among extant New World populations reflect ancient, discrete migrations to the Americas during the terminal Pleistocene. Although multiple migration models appear to explain patterns of both past and present craniometric variation, this interpretation rests on a number of key assumptions that require further investigation. We examined a series of Paleoindian (n = 11) and Archaic (n = 384) crania from North and South America, and compare these early samples to a large worldwide sample of late Holocene (n = 6,742) remains to assess within-and among-group variability in early samples, and to determine how patterns of variation could be viewed as a reflection of both population history and population structure. Analyses included univariate and multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis, calculation of biological distances, and multivariate allocation methods. We also performed model-bound analyses of these data, including Relethford-Blangero analysis and calculation of FST. Our results indicate that under the assumptions of migration/founder models, the data are consistent with Paleoindians having derived from an undifferentiated Asian population that was not ancestral to modern American Indians. This view can be accommodated into existing models of multiple founders (migrations) in the New World. However, the assumptions required for such an interpretation are not realistic, and the diversity of early populations could as easily reflect population structuring processes such as genetic drift, demographic growth, and other phenomena. When the data were analyzed controlling for the effects of genetic drift (i.e., with smaller long-term effective population sizes for Paleoindians), the Paleoindian samples were no longer distinct from modern Native American populations. Other factors that need to be considered include processes involved in craniofacial change and adaptation during the past 10,000 years. Finally, patterns of variation in the North and South American Paleoindian samples are different, suggesting that the process of New World colonization is more complex than previously assumed.

Archaeological evidence indicates the presence of humans as far as southern Chile by 14.6 thousand years ago (ka), shortly after the Pleistocene ice sheets blocking access from eastern Beringia began to retreat. Genetic estimates of the timing and route of entry have been constrained by the lack of suitable calibration points and low genetic diversity of Native Americans. We sequenced 92wholemitochondrial genomes from pre-Columbian South American skeletons dating from 8.6 to 0.5 ka, allowing a detailed, temporally calibrated reconstruction of the peopling of the Americas in a Bayesian coalescent analysis. The data suggest that a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16.0 ka, following previous isolation in eastern Beringia for ∼2.4 to 9 thousand years after separation from eastern Siberian populations. Following a rapid movement throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a marked phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted through time. All of the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression test to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages. © 2016 The Authors.",,"Calibration; Statistical tests; Calibration points; Coalescent analysis; Extinction rates; Genetic diversity; Mitochondrial DNA; Multiple logistic regression; Native Americans; Principal Components; Population statistics; ancient DNA; mitochondrial DNA; American Indian; archeology; Bayes theorem; Chile; genetic variation; genetics; haplotype; human; migration; mitochondrial genome; phylogeny; population genetics; South America; Western Hemisphere; Americas; Archaeology; Bayes Theorem; Chile; DNA, Ancient; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Mitochondrial; Haplotypes; Humans; Indians, North American; Phylogeny; South America",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973892872

Anthropol. 27:477-495, 1986) suggested a multidisciplinary model for the human settlement of the New World. Since their synthesis, several studies based mainly on partial evidence such as skull morphology and molecular genetics have presented competing, apparently mutually exclusive, settlement hypotheses. These contradictory views are represented by the genetic-based Single Wave or Out of Beringia models and the cranial morphology-based Two Components/ Stocks model. Here, we present a geometric morphometric analysis of 576 late Pleistocene/early Holocene and modern skulls suggesting that the classical Paleoamerican and Mongoloid craniofacial patterns should be viewed as extremes of a continuous morphological variation. Our results also suggest that recent contact among Asian and American circumarctic populations took place during the Holocene. These results along with data from other fields are synthesized in a model for the settlement of the New World that considers, in an integrative and parsimonious way, evidence coming from genetics and physical anthropology. This model takes into account a founder population occupying Beringia during the last glaciation characterized by high craniofacial diversity, founder mtDNA and Y-chromosome lineages and some private autosomal alleles. After a Beringian population expansion, which could have occurred concomitant with their entry into America, more recent circumarctic gene flow would have enabled the dispersion of northeast Asian-derived characters and some particular genetic lineages from East Asia to America and vice versa. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Beringia; Geometric-morphometrics; Molecular genetics; Native Americans; Settlement models; Skull shape","mitochondrial DNA; adult; allometry; American Indian; anatomical variation; article; autosome; craniofacial morphology; female; gene flow; genetic analysis; geometry; glaciation; Holocene; human; human experiment; interdisciplinary research; male; molecular genetics; morphology; morphometrics; normal human; Pleistocene; population dispersion; population research; race; skull; United States; Y chromosome; American Native Continental Ancestry Group; Americas; Anthropology, Physical; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Face; Female; Fossils; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Population Dynamics; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-52149093840

This paper addresses the question of whether there is significant variability among ancient American crania. A sample of 11 crania (Spirit Cave, Wizards Beach, Browns Valley, Pelican Rapids, Prospect, Wet Gravel male, Wet Gravel female, Medicine Crow, Turin, Lime Creek, and Swanson Lake) dating from the early to mid Holocene was available. Some have recent accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates, while others are dated geologically or archaeologically. All are in excess of 4500 BP, and most are 7000 BP or older. Measurements follow the definitions of Howells [(1973) Cranial variation in man, Cambridge: Harvard University). Some crania are incomplete, but 22 measurements were common to all fossils. Cranial variation was examined by calculating the Mahalanobis distance between each pair of fossils, using a pooled within sample covariance matrix estimated from the data of Howells. The distance relationships among crania suggest the presence of at least three distinct groups: 1) a middle Archaic Plains group (Turin and Medicine Crow), 2) a Paleo/Early Archaic Great Lakes/Plains group (Browns Valley, Pelican Rapids, Lime Creek), and 3) a spatially and temporally heterogeneous group that includes the Great Basin/Pacific Coast (Spirit Cave, Wizards Beach, Prospect) and Nebraska (Wet Gravel specimens and Swanson Lake). These crania were also compared to Howells' worldwide recent sample, which was expanded by including six additional American Indian samples. None of the fossils, except for the Wet Gravel male, shows any particular affinity to recent Native Americans; their greatest similarities are with Europe, Polynesia, or East Asia. Several. crania would be atypical in any recent population for which we have data. Browns Valley, Pelican Rapids, and Lime Creek are the most distinctive. They provide evidence for the presence of an early population that bears no similarity to the morphometric pattern of recent American Indians or even to crania of comparable date in other regions of the continent. The heterogeneity among early American crania makes it inadvisable to pool them for purposes of morphometric analysis. Whether this heterogeneity results from different early migrations or one highly differentiated population cannot be established from our data. Our results are inconsistent with hypotheses of an ancestor-descendent relationship between early and late Holocene American populations. They suggest that the pattern of cranial variation is of recent origin, at least in the Plains region. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cranial morphometrics; New World; Paleoamericans","anthropology; archeology; article; comparative study; female; fossil; geology; human; human tissue; male; mass spectrometry; migration; morphometrics; North America; skull; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Female; Fossils; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; North America; Reference Values; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035143530

In turn, this has led to suggestions that the temporal bone is particularly reliable in analyses of primate phylogeny and human population history. While several reasons have been suggested to explain the temporal bone's strong fit with neutral expectation, the temporal bone has never systematically been compared against other individual cranial bones defined using the same biological criteria. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the shapes of all cranial bones possess reliable information regarding neutral genetic evolution, or whether the temporal bone is unique in this respect. This study tests the hypothesis that the human temporal bone is more congruent with neutral expectation than six other individual cranial bones by correlating population affinity matrices generated using neutral genetic and 3D craniometric data. The results demonstrate that while the temporal bone shows the absolute strongest correlation with neutral genetic data compared with all other bones, it is not statistically differentiated from the sphenoid, frontal, and parietal bones in this regard. Potential reasons for the temporal bone's consistently strong fit with neutral expectation, such as its overall anatomical complexity and/or its contribution to the architecture of the basicranium, are examined. The results suggest that future phylogenetic and taxonomic studies would benefit from considering the shape of the entire cranium minus those regions that deviate most from neutrality. ©2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Neutral evolution; Population history; Temporal bone","article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; frontal bone; human; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phylogeny; physical anthropology; population genetics; primate; skull; sphenoid; temporal bone; Bone Development; Classification; Fossils; Gene Frequency; Genetic Markers; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Skull; Temporal Bone; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349102576

His population affinities have been the subject of scientific debate and legal controversy. Based on an initial study of cranial morphology it was asserted that Kennewick Man was neither Native American nor closely related to the claimant Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest, who claimed ancestral relationship and requested repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The morphological analysis was important to judicial decisions that Kennewick Man was not Native American and that therefore NAGPRA did not apply. Instead of repatriation, additional studies of the remains were permitted. Subsequent craniometric analysis affirmed Kennewick Man to be more closely related to circumpacific groups such as the Ainu and Polynesians than he is to modern Native Americans. In order to resolve Kennewick Man's ancestry and affiliations, we have sequenced his genome to ∼1 × coverage and compared it to worldwide genomic data including for the Ainu and Polynesians. We find that Kennewick Man is closer to modern Native Americans than to any other population worldwide. Among the Native American groups for whom genome-wide data are available for comparison, several seem to be descended from a population closely related to that of Kennewick Man, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville), one of the five tribes claiming Kennewick Man.

Although advancements in DNA analysis have overshadowed other areas of progress in the subfields of biological anthropology, bioarchaeologists are now utilizing many other new forms of technology in their work. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning offers a sophisticated method of documenting and studying prehistoric human skeletons. In recent years, portable laser scanning devices capable of creating high resolution images have become available, enabling researchers to scan and archive skeletal collections from archaeological sites and museum collections around the world. 3D laser scanners are inexpensive, simple to operate, and completely non-destructive to human skeletal material. A major benefit is that they offer a cost-effective method of creating a digital record of skeletal collections for museum archives. Since published research using 3D methods typically focuses on sophisticated analyses used to analyze 3D data that are difficult for the novice user to follow, in this paper we provide a simple and straightforward overview of 3D scanning methods aimed at non-specialists. We discuss how these methods can be used to preserve and document osteological material in museums, develop research ideas in the subfields of biological anthropology, and increase the potential for scholarly collaboration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeological methods; Bioarchaeology; Museum conservation; Three-dimensional laser scanning methods; Virtual anthropology","anthropology; archaeology; DNA; laser method; museum; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862181849

Recent evidence from these diverse fields is found to support different colonization scenarios. The currently available genetic evidence suggests a ″single migration″ model, in which both early and later Native American groups derive from one expansion event into the continent. In contrast, the pronounced anatomical differences between early and late Native American populations have led others to propose more complex scenarios, involving separate colonization events of the New World and a distinct origin for these groups. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using large samples of Early American crania, we: 1) calculated the rate of morphological differentiation between Early and Late American samples under three different time divergence assumptions, and compared our findings to the predicted morphological differentiation under neutral conditions in each case; and 2) further tested three dispersal scenarios for the colonization of the New World by comparing the morphological distances among early and late Amerindians, East Asians, Australo-Melanesians and early modern humans from Asia to geographical distances associated with each dispersion model. Results indicate that the assumption of a last shared common ancestor outside the continent better explains the observed morphological differences between early and late American groups. This result is corroborated by our finding that a model comprising two Asian waves of migration coming through Bering into the Americas fits the cranial anatomical evidence best, especially when the effects of diversifying selection to climate are taken into account. Conclusions: We conclude that the morphological diversity documented through time in the New World is best accounted for by a model postulating two waves of human expansion into the continent originating in East Asia and entering through Beringia. © 2010 Hubbe et al.",,"American Indian; article; Asia; Asian; calculation; climate; controlled study; evolution; geographic distribution; human; last common ancestor; Melanesia; morphology; population dispersion; population migration; sample; skull; time; Western Hemisphere; geography; Crania; Americas; Evolution; Geography; Humans",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956203274

Largely ignored in this debate, extreme environments are assumed either as barriers to this early wave of migration or without potential for past habitability. Here, we report on a rare 12-13ka human occupation from Quebrada Maní (site QM12), a plantless, near rainless landscape (1240m asl and 85km from the Pacific Ocean) located in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. This location harbored wetlands and riparian woodlands that were fed by increased rainfall further east in the central Andes during the latest Pleistocene. Excavations at QM12 yielded a diverse cultural assemblage of lithics, burned and cut bones, marine gastropods, pigments, plant fibers, and wooden artifacts alongside a prepared fireplace. Sixteen radiocarbon dates from site QM12 on charcoal, marine shells, animal dung, plant remains and wood reveal that the occupation took place between 12.8 and 11.7ka. These results demonstrate that the Atacama Desert was not a barrier to early American settlement and dispersal, and provide new clues for understanding the cultural complexity and diversity of the peopling of South America during the Last Glacial-interglacial transition. © 2013 The Authors.","Atacama; Early Americans; Hyperarid environments; Late Pleistocene","Archeological sites; Atacama; Early Americans; Extreme environment; Glacial interglacial transition; Hyperarid environments; Late Pleistocene; Latest pleistocene; Charcoal; Employment; Plants (botany); Landforms; archaeology; cultural history; dispersal; environmental conditions; historical geography; Last Glacial-Interglacial; lithic fragment; occupation; Pleistocene; radiocarbon dating; settlement history; Atacama Desert; Chile",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881108281

Y-chromosome STRs (DYS434, DYS437, DYS439, DYS393, DYS391, DYS390, DYS19, DYS389I, DYS389II, and DYS388) and the biallelic system DYS199 were also amplified, Y-STR alleles could be characterized in nine cases, with an average of 4.1 loci per sample correctly typed. In two samples of the same ethnic group (Aonikenk), an identical and complete eight-loci haplotype was recovered. The DYS199 biallelic system was used as a control of contamination by modern DNA and, along with DYS19, as a marker of American origin. The analysis of both mtDNA and Y-STRs revealed DNA from Amerindian ancestry. The observed polymorphisms are consistent with the hypothesis that the ancient Fuegians are close to populations from south-central Chile and Argentina, but their high nucleotide diversity and the frequency of single lineages strongly support early genetic differentiation of the Fuegians through combined processes of population bottleneck, isolation, and/or migration, followed by strong genetic drift. This suggests an early genetic diversification of the Fuegians right after their arrival at the southernmost extreme of South America. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","America; Ancient DNA; Fuegians; MtDNA; Tierra del Fuego; Y-STR","mitochondrial DNA; Aborigine; allele; Argentina; article; Chile; DNA determination; DNA polymorphism; DNA sequence; gene amplification; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic marker; genetic variability; haplotype; human; population differentiation; population migration; short tandem repeat; South America; Y chromosome; Argentina; Bone and Bones; Chile; Chromosomes, Human, Y; DNA, Mitochondrial; History, 19th Century; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Polymorphism, Genetic; Population Dynamics; Tandem Repeat Sequences; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1942518744

Different ecological conditions obtain in each subarea: puna, altiplano, and precordillera in the highlands; valleys, the desert, and oases in the intermediate zone; and coastal environments along the Pacific shores. In prehistoric times, all these environments were very interconnected. There are three different cultural traditions in the local prehistory: the early hunting and gathering tradition (10,000-4000 B.P.), the Chinchorro Tradition (7500-2500 B.P.), and the Altiplano or Andean Tradition (3000-0 B.P.). This proposed sequence is described, with emphasis on the early Chinchorro adaptations, including the important patterns of mummification, and its possible relation to tropical forest groups of the Amazon basin; and the Pre-Tiwanaku and later Tiwanaku and Inca developments, in relation to the circum-Titicaca region.

The study of small sites with brief occupation spans can open windows on high-resolution contexts in which associations and activities are clear. Through the use of a program designed to identify lacustrine Pleistocene environments in which the initial human populations would presumably have settled, Quebrada Santa Julia, a site attesting to human presence dating to 13,000 calibrated years BP, has recently been located on the semiarid coast of Chile. It is the only known Paleoindian site with fluted projectile points in unambiguous association with extinct megafauna on the Andean Pacific coast. It represents a small lakeside camp with a brief occupation span in which multiple activities, including the processing of prey transported from a nearby location, were conducted. The present of extralocal lithic raw materials argues for movements into the interior, as has been suggested for other early settlements in the Andean region. Notwithstanding its proximity to the littoral, the site has not yielded any evidence of the exploitation of marine resources. © 2007 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

In a previous communication, we were able to show, by means of a distance analysis, that a craniofacial differentiation accompanied the process of cultural evolution in the valleys (Rothhammer and Santoro [2001] Lat. Am. Antiq. 12:59-66). Recently, numerous South Amerindian mtDNA studies were published, and more accurate molecular techniques to study ancient mtDNA are available. In view of these recent developments, we decided 1) to study chronological changes of ancient mtDNA haplogroup frequencies in the nearby Lluta, Azapa, and Camarones Valleys, 2) to identify microevolutionary forces responsible for such changes, and 3) to compare ancient mtDNA haplogroup frequencies with previous data in order to validate craniometrical results and to reconstruct the biological history of the prehistoric valley groups in the context of their interaction with culturally more developed highland populations. From a total of 97 samples from 83 individuals, 68 samples (61 individuals) yielded amplifications for the fragments that harbor classical mtDNA markers. The haplogroup distribution among the total sample was as follows: 26.2%, haplogroup A; 34.4%, haplogroup B; 14.8%, haplogroup C; 3.3%, haplogroup D; and 21.3%, other haplogroups. Haplogroup B tended to increase, and haplogroup A to decrease during a 3,900-year time interval. The sequence data are congruent with the haplogroup analysis. In fact, the sequencing of hypervariable region I of 30 prehistoric individuals revealed 43 polymorphic sites. Sequence alignment and subsequent phylogenetic tree construction showed two major clusters associated with the most common restriction haplogroups. Individuals belonging to haplogroups C and D tended to cluster together with nonclassical lineages. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Ancient mtDNA; Cultural change; Highland migration; Microevolution","DNA marker; mitochondrial DNA; American Indian; article; bone; Chile; chronology; craniofacial morphology; cultural anthropology; desert; differentiation; DNA determination; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; evolution; facies; gene amplification; gene cluster; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; human; migration; phylogeny; Base Sequence; Cephalometry; Chile; Cluster Analysis; Cultural Evolution; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution, Molecular; Fossils; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18644368853

However, some aspects concerning the population affinities among early and modern Asians and Native Americans remain controversial. Specifically, contradictory views based mainly on partial evidence such as skull morphology or molecular genetics have led to hypotheses such as the ""Two Waves/Components"" and ""Single Wave"" or ""Out of Beringia"" model, respectively. Alternatively, an integrative scenario considering both morphological and molecular variation has been proposed and named as the ""Recurrent Gene Flow"" hypothesis. This scenario considers a single origin for all the Native Americans, and local, within-continent evolution plus the persistence of contact among Circum-Arctic groups. Here we analyze 2D geometric morphometric data to evaluate the associations between observed craniometric distance matrix and different geographic design matrices reflecting distinct scenarios for the peopling of the New World using basic and partial Mantel tests. Additionally, we calculated the rate of morphological differentiation between Early and Late American samples under the different settlement scenarios and compared our findings to the predicted morphological differentiation under neutral conditions. Also, we incorporated in our analyses some variants of the classical Single Wave and Two Waves models as well as the Recurrent Gene Flow model. Our results suggest a better explanatory performance of the Recurrent Gene Flow model, and provide additional insights concerning affinities among Asian and Native American Circum-Arctic groups.

Acknowledging vault modifications, researchers have sought measurements in other regions which are unaffected by deformation. In the 1970s, a set of 10 ""relatively"" unaffected facial measurements was identified in Argentinean crania that later became the basis of numerous South American biodistance studies. These measurements include: minimum frontal breadth, bizygomatic breadth, orbit height, orbit breadth, palate breath, palate length, upper facial height, basion-prosthion length, nasal height, and nasal breadth. Palate length was excluded from the present analysis due to considerable measurement error. The suitability of these measurements in populations other than Argentineans has not been rigorously tested. Using a sample of 350 prehistoric crania from the Museo Arqueológico San Miguel de Azapa (MASMA, Arica, Chile), this project tested the hypothesis that these measurements are unaffected by either annular or tabular deformation. Results obtained from MANOVA analysis indicate this hypothesis cannot be fully supported. Among males, only 3 of the 9 measurements are unaffected by either form of deformation (palate breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth), while analysis of females indicates that 4 of the 9 measurements remain unaltered (minimum frontal breadth, orbit breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth). Additionally, analogous to the vault, facial measurements display patterns consistent with the deformation applied. Two implications can be drawn from this research: 1) previous studies using these measurements must be interpreted cautiously, and 2) researchers using these measurements must explicitly test their suitability in each population. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Artificial; Biodistance; Craniofacial; Face; Intentional; South America","Argentina; article; calculation; Chile; craniofacial morphology; face malformation; geological time; measurement; multivariate analysis of variance; palate; population distribution; skull malformation; Cephalometry; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Facial Bones; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Skull; South America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746217091

In this context, the finding of remains from five individuals dated to the 9th millenium BP on the re-excavations at Baño Nuevo Cave (Andean Central Patagonia, Chile) is particularly interesting. They may not appear excessively old, but several radiocarbon dates (two of them done through AMS directly on the bone of one of the individuals) place them among the very few well-dated early human skeletons throughout the Americas. The small sample size militates against any interpretation of biological affiliation (to say nothing of population movements) and we can only affirm that these people belonged to a generalized ""mongoloid stock"", different from historically known Patagonian populations.

The skeletons found at this site were ascribed to the Early to Middle Holocene and represented the oldest known population of Western South America, and thus were used in several studies addressing the early population history of the continent. However, later excavations at Lauricocha led to doubts regarding the antiquity of the site. Here, we provide new dating, craniometric, and genetic evidence for this iconic site. We obtained new radiocarbon dates, generated complete mitochondrial genomes and nuclear SNP data from five individuals, and re-analyzed the human remains of Lauricocha to revise the initial morphological and craniometric analysis conducted in the 1960's. We show that Lauricocha was indeed occupied in the Early to Middle Holocene but the temporal spread of dates we obtained from the human remains show that they do not qualify as a single contemporaneous population. However, the genetic results from five of the individuals fall within the spectrum of genetic diversity observed in pre-Columbian and modern Native Central American populations. © 2015 Fehren-Schmitz et al.

These remains are from Acha-3, a site 5.4 km from the coastline at the confluence of the Acha ravine and Azapa valley. Findings from Acha-3 (a) define funerary, technological, and economic patterns for the Early Archaic (9,000-8,000 B.C.) with strong Chinchorro tradition connections, (b) demonstrate a subsistence strategy adapted to the marine ecosystem by means of associated bioarchaeological data, and (c) identify the oldest funerary site known for the lowlands of the south-central Andes. Two radiocarbon dates place Acha-3 at the end of the Early Archaic period and link it, culturally as well as chronologically, to Acha-2, a campsite. A burial at Acha-3 contains three individuals wearing headbands fabricated from camelid and plant fibers. The bodies were wrapped with camelid and sea lion skins and decorated plant fiber mats in an elaborate funerary bundle, with few offerings. Although there are no signs of artificial mummification, the clear intention to straighten and stiffen the bodies in elaborate funerary bundles, the multiple extended inhumations, and the associated cultural elements suggest that Acha-3 treatments were local precursors to Chinchorro funerary practices.

There was a negative correlation between δ15N and δ13C for coastal sites, but a positive correlation for valley sites. Results for the valley sites point to a diet that was influenced by marine resources throughout all time periods. The unusually heavy δ15N values for the coastal sites require a dietary component with a δ15N composition significantly heavier than that of marine resources. The hyper-aridity at the study area (mean annual rainfall of 0.5-0.6mm/year) is a likely contributing factor to the production of heavy δ15N values, but is unlikely to account for the heaviest δ15N values (&gt;+30‰). One possible explanation for the heaviest δ15N values is that dietary components were impacted by isotopically-heavy guano, which is abundant in the region. Guano may have been used as a fertilizer during crop cultivation at the onset of the Formative period, continuing through the Historic period after Spanish contact. The indirect impact of guano from abundant bird habitats in the region may have influenced wild foodstuffs harvested throughout the pre-agricultural period. Results provide support for the utility of dental calculus as a proxy for obtaining stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures for use in paleodietary studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioarchaeology; Carbon; Chile prehistory; Dental calculus; Nitrogen; Paleodiet; Seabird guano; Stable isotopes","carbon isotope; dentition; diet; guano; Holocene; nitrogen isotope; paleoenvironment; prehistoric; resource allocation; stable isotope; Chile; Aves",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882692839

We present a set of δ13Ccollagen and δ15Ncollagen isotopic values on the main faunal resources from the forest and steppe areas of the Aisén region (Central-Western Patagonia, Chile), in order to characterise their isotopic ranges and assess their consumption by past hunter-gatherer populations. Two sets of bioarchaeological remains are used for this comparison; a 10200-9700calyear bp assemblage from Baño Nuevo cave and a 1600-300calyear bp assemblage gathered at different locations throughout Aisén. Isotopic signals from both assemblages indicate diets based on the consumption of protein provided by terrestrial mammals from steppe environments and no long-term signature of forest-resource consumption. On the other hand, the earlier group shows values that may indicate a wider dietary breadth, although this observation is preliminary. These results further suggest that the use of forests and the resources they provided, although visible through the zooarchaeological record (i.e. taxa represented at sites), must have been discontinuous and, perhaps, marginal in comparison with steppe regions. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Carbon and nitrogen isotopes; Forest/steppe ecotone; Human diets; Isotopic ecology; Western Patagonia",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897478545

Despite the strong cultural influence of Tiwanaku and numerous other groups evident in interactions with Atacameños, the role of immigration into the oases during this period is unclear. While archaeological and bioarchaeological research in the region has shown no evidence that clearly indicates large groups of foreign immigrants, the contemporary increase in interregional exchange networks connecting the oases to other parts of the Andes suggests residential mobility and the possibility that movement of people both into and out of the oases accompanied these foreign influences. Here, we analyze biodistance through cranial non-metric traits in a skeletal sample from prehistoric San Pedro de Atacama to elucidate the extent of foreign influence in the oases and discuss its implications. We analyzed 715 individuals from the Middle Period (AD 400-1000) and later Regional Developments Period (AD 1000-1450), and found greater phenotypic differences between Middle Period cemeteries than among cemeteries in the subsequent period. We argue that this greater diversity extends beyond the relationship between the oases and the renowned Tiwanaku polity and reflects the role of the oases and its different ayllus as a node and way station for the Middle Period's myriad interregional networks.

Wear rate and plane (angle) were additionally evaluated using a subsample of paired first and second mandibular molars. The Formative period represents the transition from marine foraging to agro-pastoral dependence in the region, and differences in oral pathology indicate that diet varied by site location (coast vs valley interior) but not by archaeological phase (early vs late). We predicted that occlusal wear would demonstrate similar patterns, resulting from differences in food consistency, and therefore hypothesised that in coastal groups consuming greater quantities of foraged foods, occlusal surfaces should wear faster and exhibit flat molar wear, whereas among valley interior groups consuming greater quantities of agro-pastoral products, these should wear slower but exhibit more angled molar wear. Heavier posterior tooth wear was identified among coastal residents, but rate and angle of molar occlusal attrition did not differ significantly by location. Heavier overall wear and a steeper molar wear plane were identified during the early phase indicating that food consistency varied somewhat over the course of the Formative period. Overall, the results indicate that, although limited differences in tooth wear exist by site location, wear varied more over time likely reflecting a gradual transition from foraging to agro-pastoral dependence in the lower Azapa Valley. Although oral health indicators point to differences in dietary investment by location, maintenance of a mixed subsistence economy likely sustained a comparative consistency of foodstuffs. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Chile; Formative period; Marine foraging; Occlusal wear plane; Tooth wear",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879090777

During the 19th century, craniometric studies suggested that the Botocudo resembled more the Paleoamerican population of Lagoa Santa than typical Native Americans groups. These results suggest that the Botocudo Indians might represent a population that retained the biological characteristics of early groups of the continent, remaining largely isolated from groups that gave origin to the modern Native South American variation. Moreover, recently, some of the Botocudo remains have been shown to have mitochondrial and autosomal DNA lineages currently found in Polynesian populations. Here, we explore the morphological affinities of Botocudo skulls within a worldwide context. Distinct multivariate analyses based on 32 craniometric variables show that 1) the two individuals with Polynesian DNA sequences have morphological characteristics that fall within the Polynesian and Botocudo variation, making their assignation as Native American specimens problematic, and 2) there are high morphological affinities between Botocudo, Early Americans, and the Polynesian series of Easter Island, which support the early observations that the Botocudo can be seen as retaining the Paleoamerican morphology, particularly when the neurocranium is considered. Although these results do not elucidate the origin of the Polynesian DNA lineages among the Botocudo, they support the hypothesis that the Botocudo represent a case of late survival of ancient Paleoamerican populations, retaining the morphological characteristics of ancestral Late Pleistocene populations from Asia. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cranial morphology; Lagoa Santa; Paleoamerican; settlement of the Americas","DNA; anatomical variation; Article; Brazil; DNA sequence; human; Indian; Late Holocene; measurement; morphological trait; morphology; skull; American Indian; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; female; genetics; male; migration; Oceanic ancestry group; physical anthropology; Polynesia; skull; statistics and numerical data; Anthropology, Physical; Brazil; Cephalometry; Female; Human Migration; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Polynesia; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929617500

In particular, it is unclear whether high levels of between-group craniometric diversity in South America result from multiple migrations or from local diversification processes. Previous attempts to explain this diversity have largely focused on testing alternative dispersal or gene flow models, reaching conflicting or inconclusive results. Here, a novel analytical framework is applied to three-dimensional geometric morphometric data to partition the effects of population divergence from geographically mediated gene flow to understand the ancestry of the early South Americans in the context of global human history. The results show that Paleoamericans share a last common ancestor with contemporary Native American groups outside, rather than inside, the Americas. Therefore, and in accordance with some recent genomic studies, craniometric data suggest that the New World was populated by multiple waves of dispersion from northeast Asia throughout the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved;",,"Genes; Cranial morphology; Early Holocene; Evolutionary population; Genomic studies; Geometric morphometric; Late Pleistocene; Multiple waves; Native Americans; Population statistics; American Indian; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; female; history; human; male; skull; South America; Cephalometry; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Skull; South America",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024503877

The rich fossil record of Morocco allows assessing changes in facial morphology from the late Middle Pleistocene through the Late Pleistocene. Specimens associated with the Aterian industry in Morocco were originally thought to be relatively recent (40–20 ka), but could be much older (35–90 ka). Predating this population are the late Middle Pleistocene specimens of Irhoud. Later in the same geographical area, larger samples are represented by the Iberomaurusian series. We conducted a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of the facial shape of the Aterian specimen Dar es-Soltan II-5, with the aim of deciphering the affinities of this specimen with earlier North African and Levantine fossils, later Upper Paleolithic Eurasian specimens, as well as later North African populations. We used a large comparative sample (n = 191) comprising seven geographic populations of recent humans, Iberomaurusians from Afalou and Taforalt (n = 22), and Middle and Late Pleistocene Eurasian and African fossils. The 3D coordinates of 19 facial landmarks were collected. Specimen landmark configurations were processed with Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Principal Components, Canonical Variates, and cluster analyses were performed and Procrustes distances and Mahalanobis squared distances were calculated. Both Irhoud 1 and Dar es-Soltan II-5 are similar to the early anatomically modern humans from Qafzeh, and the Iberomaurusian sample is closely connected to the Upper Paleolithic European sample. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aterian; Facial morphology; Modern human origins; Neandertals; Upper Paleolithic",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045656827

The prevailing view is that the first Paleoindians, ancestors of the Amerindians, arrived from Asia and Beringia to the American continent using a Pacific coastal route in pre-Clovis times. In this article skeletal remains dated 9000-4000 BP, excavated from archaeological sites in northern, central and southern Chile, were analyzed using geometric morphometric and ancient mtDNA techniques. Results indicate that the ancient cranial material from southwestern South America exhibit a wide range of cranial vault shape variation which is independent of chronology. mtDNA restriction and sequence analysis performed on the same skeletal remains, revealed only the presence of the main four founding mtDNA haplogroups (A, B, C and D) as early as 9,000 BP. Our results using morphometric and molecular mtDNA haplogroup data show that human populations inhabiting the Americas during archaic times can not be considered as belonging to two different groups on the basis of analyzed data. These results are consistent with those recently obtained using complete sequence mtDNA analyses.","Ancient mtDNA; Geometric morphometrics; Paleoindian and archaic crania; Peopling of America",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84055176660

Nonetheless, so far only two paleoindian skeletons have been exhumed from the local rockshelters. The oldest one (9870 ± 50 BP; CAL 11060 ± 50), uncovered in Toca dos Coqueiros and known as ""Zuzu,"" represents a rare opportunity to explore the biological relationships of paleoindian groups living in northeastern Brazil. As previously demonstrated, South and Central America Paleoindians present skull morphology distinct from the one found nowadays in Amerindians and similar to Australo-Melanesians. Here we test the hypothesis that Zuzu shows higher morphological affinity with Paleoindians. However, Zuzu is a controversial skeleton since previous osteological assessments have disagreed on several aspects, especially regarding its sex. Thus, we compared Zuzu to males and females independently. Morphological affinities were assessed through clustering of principal components considering 18 worldwide populations and through principal components analysis of the individual dispersion of five key regions for America's settlement. The results obtained do not allow us to refute the hypothesis, expanding the known geographical dispersion of the Paleoindian morphology into northeast Brazil. To contribute to the discussion regarding Zuzu's sex, a new estimation is presented based on visual inspection of cranial and postcranial markers, complemented by a discriminant analysis of its morphology in relation to the paleoindian sample. The results favor a male classification and are consistent with the mortuary offerings found in the burial, yet do not agree with a molecular determination. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","First Americans; Multivariate analysis; Paleoindians; Sex assignment","DNA; anatomical variation; archeology; article; Brazil; craniometry; female; fossil; Holocene; human; male; molecular evolution; principal component analysis; skeleton; skull; South America; Brazil; Classification; Cluster Analysis; Female; Fossils; Humans; Male; Sex Characteristics; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548750956

The results show obvious differences between groups living on the coast and those living in the valley. The history of the settlement of Arica is interpreted as the result of two main settlement events, one linked with the establishment of coastal fishermen and the other with the development of agro-pastoralism, the latter becoming predominant in the later periods.

Morphometric analyses from these Argentinean Pampas samples are presented together with early samples from Chile, Brazil, and Colombia. Results show that while there is no clear separation between early and late samples from Chile, samples from Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina show more pronounced differences, the latter presenting the largest morphological variation among early American samples. However, the hypotheses that morphological differences between early and late American samples are related to evolutionary processes are difficult to support using cranial morphometric differences alone.

A recurrent paleoanthropological concern is about the understanding of the great deal of craniofacial diversity that evolved into the Americas, which includes a vector of continuum variation between a generalized morphology observed among humans groups leading the Out-of-Africa dispersion, and a derived set of craniofacial traits classically labeled as “mongoloid” and that would have arise in Asia during the Holocene. Here, we use geometric morphometric techniques and multivariate statistics along with quantitative genetic approaches to look more closely into the human craniofacial evolutionary history during the Late Pleistocene–Early Holocene from Asia and the New World. We detected significant signals of deviation of the neutral evolutionary expectations, suggesting an important action of non-stochastic evolution (e.g. natural selection, phenotypic plasticity) in the Americas. We also found further support to the Recurrent Gene Flow model that refers to an ancestral, founder population experiencing a standstill in Beringia, and exhibiting high within-group craniofacial variation. This original, internally variable stock would have been the ancestral source of variation that fuelled the subsequent local micro evolution of other derived phenotypic patterns, giving origin to the craniofacial diversity observed among Holocene Native American samples. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Craniofacial evolution; Geometric morphometrics; New world settlement; Paleoamericans; Quantitative genetics","cranium; genetics; Holocene; human evolution; human settlement; morphometry; quantitative analysis; Asia; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948799702

Among the ongoing debates surrounding the peopling of South America, there has been a great deal of focus on the cranial shape of prehistoric populations on this continent, which some researchers have described as having two distinct forms. The cranial shape of early Holocene Paleoamericans, which predate approximately 8000 years BP, has been categorized as dolichocephalic (long-headed), while late Holocene populations have been generally described as brachycephalic (round-headed), despite more recent assessments that examine variation with a higher level of precision. Although more detailed analytical approaches to investigating craniofacial variation are available, researchers still categorize South American crania as having these two head shapes. These distinctions in head shape have been used to infer multiple origin models, some of which contend that the dolichocephalic population was biologically distinct and later replaced by brachycephalic individuals. In contrast, genetic studies infer a common ancestral origin among all prehistoric South American populations. Given discrepancies between genetic and cranial data, our study tests the hypothesis that Holocene populations consist of two cranial morphologies that coincide with the early and late Holocene periods. Using high-resolution 3D models generated from a laser surface scanner, cranial indices for 95 individuals from western South America dating from the Early, Middle, and Late periods were analyzed, most of which have been excluded from cranial assessments in South America. Our results show that the majority of crania analyzed in this study have an intermediate (mesocephalic) head shape, spatiotemporal variability, and no clear transition from dolichocephaly to brachycephaly during the Holocene. By re-examining the relevance of these categories that are determined through the calculation of the cranial index, and general morphological descriptions (long and narrow or short and wide skulls) that coincide with them, our research offers valuable insight into the ongoing debates centered on the colonization of South America. Given our results, we propose that caution should be used when referring to the terms “dolichocephalic” and “brachycephalic” head shapes and the general morphological descriptions for these terms to categorize early and late Holocene South American populations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","3D laser scanning; Andean archaeology; Bioarchaeology; Cranial variation; Human skeletal biology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009798880

This study analyzes the craniofacial size and shape variation of diachronic samples from the study region to test distinct population history scenarios that support continuity or, alternatively, divergence. Materials and methods: A total of 92 adult skulls belonging to five chronological groups, ranging from c. 10,100 to 350 14C YBP, were analyzed through Procrustean geometric morphometric techniques. Matrix correlation analysis, multivariate exploratory (PCA, FDA), and evolutionary quantitative genetic methods (R-matrix analysis and β-test) were used to study the diachronic craniofacial shape variation. Results: A model that supports strong evolutionary diversification over the Holocene better explains the patterns of morphological variation observed. At least two periods of significant craniofacial size and shape change were detected: one during the middle to initial late Holocene transition (c. 4,000–3,200 14C YBP) and other toward the final late Holocene (post-2,000 14C YBP), which exhibit differences in the pattern and magnitude of cranial divergence. In addition, the differentiation viewed between early and mid-Holocene foragers could mark the initial entry of non-local populations into the region toward the beginnings of the middle Holocene. Discussion: Distinct to previous investigations the present study supports a more complex regional population history where multiple population contractions/extinctions, dispersals and assimilations along with dietary adaptations took place during the last 10,000 years. These results are in agreement with the archaeological and paleoecological record which suggests marked periods of change rather than temporal stability. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biocultural discontinuity; Bogotá highplain; geometric morphometrics; Holocene; skull morphology","adult; correlation analysis; diet; differentiation; exploratory research; forager; Late Holocene; model; morphology; morphometrics; muscle contractility; nonhuman; quantitative study; skull; South America; American Indian; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; Colombia; evolution; face; female; history; human; male; skull; Adult; Biological Evolution; Cephalometry; Colombia; Face; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996931199

One of the most common means of assessing biological differences is through comparing craniofacial metrics. Craniofacial growth is under genetic control but strongly influenced by environmental factors, including artificial cranial modification (ACM). Some scholars believe ACM affects craniofacial metrics, but other scholars disagree. This study seeks to remedy this debate. A total of 218 adult crania (101 unmodified, 117 modified) from coastal and inland sites of three northern Chilean valleys were surveyed and examined for craniofacial metric changes through the use of modern orthodontic cephalometric analyses. Unmodified crania were statistically tested with the hierarchical linear analysis test to determine if there were any differences based on site, region (coast vs. inland), period, or sex within the unmodified sample, followed by a comparison of these data to modified cranial data. Statistical tests, specifically the ANOVA test, of the data determined that ACM affected some but not all craniofacial measurements utilized in this study. This conclusion, coupled with the varying conclusions of similar previously conducted studies, suggests that scholars must be cautious in employing modified crania and craniofacial metrics in any study of biological affinities.","Andes; Artificial cranial modification; Bioarqueología; Cephalometry; Craniofacial metrics",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944237246

Craniometric information obtained from a sample of 565 individuals from different sites of the studied regions was evaluated using methods derived from quantitative genetics and multivariate statistical analysis techniques. It is shown that during the Formative and Tiwanaku periods inhabitants of the Cochabamba valleys maintained contact with the population of northern Chile. This contact was more fluid with the people from the interior valley of Azapa than it was with the settlers of San Pedro Atacama (SPA). An important biological affinity in the Late Period between the inhabitants of the Azapa valley and the late SPA groups is also examined.

The results reaffirm the differences between the coastal and interior Azapa valley groups and strengthen the hypothesis of two pathways to populating the south central Andean area.

Our analyses focus on early series from Lagoa Santa, East-Central Brazil, and Sabana de Bogotá, Colombia, and are based on multivariate analyses of linear craniometric measurements of these series and reference worldwide populations. Our results indicate strong morphological affinities between early Americans and Late Pleistocene specimens from Europe and East Asia, suggesting that the first American groups shared the same morphological pattern seen in other parts of the planet by the end of the Pleistocene. These analyses suggest that the best scenario to explain the morphological diversity seen in the continent across time is one that assumes an extra influx of morphological diversity into the continent during the Holocene, given that in situ differentiation cannot explain the diversity observed across time. However, it is unclear with the present data the nature of this extra influx, if due to two discrete dispersion waves into the continent or if due to continuous gene-flow from Asia during the Holocene. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943374797
