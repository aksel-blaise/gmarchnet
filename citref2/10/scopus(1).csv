These methods show differences in shape among specimens as residuals after rotation, translation, and scaling them so that they align as well as possible. A new method is presented that generalizes Siegel and Benson's (1982) resistant-fit theta-rho analysis so that more than two objects can be compared at the same time. Both least-squares and resistant-fit approaches are generalized to allow for affine transformations (uniform shape change). The methods are compared, using artificial data and data on 18 landmarks on the wings of 127 species of North American mosquitoes.

Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude more individuals than previous studies and to obtain new insights about the past. We show that the populations of Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ∼8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ∼24,000-year-old Siberian. By ∼6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact ∼4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people from Germany traced ∼75% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya, documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans until at least ∼3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results provide support for a steppe origin of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We propose an approach to investigate the role of development for morphological asymmetry by means of morphometric methods. Our approach combines geometric morphometrics with the two-way ANOVA customary for conventional analyses of fluctuating asymmetry and can discover localized features of shape variation by examining the patterns of covariance among landmarks This approach extends the notion of form used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry from collections of distances between morphological landmarks to an explicitly geometric concept of shape characterized by the configuration of landmarks. We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings of tsetse files (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring of young and old females. The morphological landmarks differed markedly in their degree of variability, but multivariate patterns of landmark covariation identified by principal component analysis were generally similar between fluctuating asymmetry (within-individual variability) and variation among individuals. Therefore, there is no evidence that special developmental processes control fluctuating asymmetry. We relate some of the morphometric patterns to processes known to be involved in the development of fly wings.","Developmental stability; Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Glossina palpalis; Procrustes analysis; Shape; Tsetse flies; Wing veins","developmental biology; fluctuating asymmetry; instability; methodology; morphometry; Diptera; Glossina palpalis; Glossinidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031731745

However, there is debate about whether these changes resulted from the circulation of ideas or from human migrations, potentially also facilitating the spread of languages and certain phenotypic traits. We investigated this by using new, improved methods to sequence low-coverage genomes from 101 ancient humans from across Eurasia. We show that the Bronze Age was a highly dynamic period involving large-scale population migrations and replacements, responsible for shaping major parts of present-day demographic structure in both Europe and Asia. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesized spread of Indo-European languages during the Early Bronze Age. We also demonstrate that light skin pigmentation in Europeans was already present at high frequency in the Bronze Age, but not lactose tolerance, indicating a more recent onset of positive selection on lactose tolerance than previously thought. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Computerized geometric morphometric methods for quantitative shape analysis measure, test and visualize differences in form in a highly effective, reproducible, accurate and statistically powerful way. Plant leaves are commonly used in taxonomic analyses and are particularly suitable to landmark based geometric morphometrics. However, botanists do not yet seem to have taken advantage of this set of methods in their studies as much as zoologists have done. Using free software and an example dataset from two geographical populations of sessile oak leaves, we describe in detailed but simple terms how to: a) compute size and shape variables using Procrustes methods; b) test measurement error and the main levels of variation (population and trees) using a hierachical design; c) estimate the accuracy of group discrimination; d) repeat this estimate after controlling for the effect of size differences on shape (i.e., allometry). Measurement error was completely negligible; individual variation in leaf morphology was large and differences between trees were generally bigger than within trees; differences between the two geographic populations were small in both size and shape; despite a weak allometric trend, controlling for the effect of size on shape slighly increased discrimination accuracy. Procrustes based methods for the analysis of landmarks were highly efficient in measuring the hierarchical structure of differences in leaves and in revealing very small-scale variation. In taxonomy and many other fields of botany and biology, the application of geometric morphometrics contributes to increase scientific rigour in the description of important aspects of the phenotypic dimension of biodiversity. Easy to follow but detailed step by step example studies can promote a more extensive use of these numerical methods, as they provide an introduction to the discipline which, for many biologists, is less intimidating than the often inaccessible specialistic literature. © 2011 Viscosi, Cardini.",,"accuracy; allometry; article; computer program; controlled study; discriminant analysis; geographical variation (species); geometric morphometrics; leaf morphology; measurement error; morphometrics; multivariate analysis of covariance; nonhuman; oak; permutation test; plant taxonomy; Quercus petraea; statistical analysis; analysis of variance; classification; geography; histology; Italy; methodology; oak; organ size; plant leaf; population dynamics; regression analysis; Quercus petraea; Analysis of Variance; Classification; Discriminant Analysis; Geography; Italy; Organ Size; Plant Leaves; Population Dynamics; Quercus; Regression Analysis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053446079

Elements considered are: the distal humerus, proximal and distal radius, distal tibia, distal metapodials, astragalus, calcaneus, and the first and second phalanx. This evaluation includes an assessment of 1385 elements from 49 goat and 84 modern sheep skeletons. It also includes a blind test on elements drawn from 20 specimens taken by six analysts with differing levels of experience. Overall, the criteria evaluated are highly reliable, especially in goats and only slightly less so in sheep. A major exception is the distal tibia, where diagnostic criteria tested proved substantially less reliable than other criteria evaluated here. Strongly positive results were also obtained when the sample was partitioned by sex, domestic status, and age. Results of the blind test show some variability depending on the level of experience of the analyst, underscoring the need for training and access to adequate modern reference collections before attempting to apply these criteria to archaeological assemblages. The results of this assessment stand in stark contrast to those obtained in an earlier assessment of the reliability of criteria used to distinguish between mandibles and mandibular teeth of sheep and goats. In all but a few teeth, dental criteria proved to be much less reliable, especially in goats. They were also significantly less reliable in the identification of both younger and older animals. Unlike dental criteria, there are no biases introduced by variable reliability of postcranial criteria that distort taxon-specific harvest profiles based on long-bones. © 2010.","Goat; Post-crania; Sheep; Taxonomic identification","archaeology; assessment method; bone; cranium; goat; identification key; reliability analysis; sheep; skeleton; taxonomy; tooth; Animalia; Capra; Capra hircus; Crania; Ovis; Ovis aries",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956174032

A vast network of trade routes, it connected the diverse geographies and populations of China, the Eurasian Steppe, Central Asia, India, Western Asia, and Europe. Although its main use was for importing silk from China, traders moving in the opposite direction carried to China jewelry, glassware, and other exotic goods from the Mediterranean, jade from Khotan, and horses and furs from the nomads of the Steppe. In both directions, technology and ideologies were transmitted. The Silk Road brought together the achievements of the different peoples of Eurasia to advance the Old World as a whole. The majority of the Silk Road routes passed through the Eurasian Steppe, whose nomadic people were participants and mediators in its economic and cultural exchanges. Until now, the origins of these routes and relationships have not been examined in great detail. In The Prehistory of the Silk Road, E. E. Kuzmina, renowned Russian archaeologist, looks at the history of this crucial area before the formal establishment of Silk Road trade and diplomacy. From the late Neolithic period to the early Bronze Age, Kuzmina traces the evolution of the material culture of the Steppe and the contact between civilizations that proved critical to the development of the widespread trade that would follow, including nomadic migrations, the domestication and use of the horse and the camel, and the spread of wheeled transport. The Prehistory of the Silk Road combines detailed research in archaeology with evidence from physical anthropology, linguistics, and other fields, incorporating both primary and secondary sources from a range of languages, including a vast accumulation of Russian-language scholarship largely untapped in the West. The book is complemented by an extensive bibliography that will be of great use to scholars. © 2008 University of Pennsylvania Press. All rights reserved.",,,Book,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012117842

An understanding of its osteology is therefore important to the zoo-archaeologist. The aims of this study are: (a) to determine when the epiphyses of long-bones of wethers and rams fuse; (b) to understand how castration affects dental and limb-bone development; (c) to examine the relation between age and bone-size; and (d) to find osteometric ways of distinguishing between the three sexes using a collection of 12 male (ram) and 30 castrate (wether) unimproved Shetland sheep skeletons whose ages range from 8 to 52 months (wethers) and 11 to 31 months (rams). They are compared to the 26 adult females (ewes) of the same breed in Davis (1996) Journal of Archaeological Science 23, 593-612. Fusion of the wethers' epiphyses proceeds continuously, and by their fifth year all limb-bone epiphyses are fully fused. Despite much variation in the ages of epiphysial closure, rams appear to fuse their epiphyses considerably earlier than wethers, which corroborates earlier studies. This delay of fusion in wethers allows elongation of long-bones. While castration appears to have little influence on the age at which milk teeth are replaced, rams' teeth may wear slightly faster than those of wethers. Most bones or parts of bones probably cease growing at or before epiphysial fusion. Some important exceptions include the scapula, distal humerus, proximal radius (and astragalus), which appear to continue growing for some time. Measurements of these bones or parts of bones may therefore be less useful for comparing sheep from different sites/periods. Apart from the pubis shaft thickness, long-bone lengths and shaft widths, few dimensions provide a clear distinction between males, females and castrates. Plots of long-bone lengths versus shaft widths do show some shape differences between the three sexes with ewes being short and slender, rams being short and robust and wethers being long and slender. These inter-sex differences however do not appear to provide a clear identification of archaeological specimens of sheep long-bones.

Here we present a discriminant function model linking astragalus morphology to four broadly defined habitat categories (open, light cover, heavy cover, and closed) using modern bovids of known ecology. Twenty-four measurements were taken on a sample of 286 astragali from 36 extant African antelope species. These measurements were used to generate ratios reflecting shape. An 11 variable discriminant function model was developed that had high classification success rates for complete astragali. Resubstitution analysis, jackknife analysis, and the classification of several ""test samples"" of specimens suggest that the predictive accuracy of this model is around 87%. The total classification success rates of 87% (jackknifed) or 93% (resubstitution) are considerably higher than those derived in another study of bovid astragalus ecomorphology (67%; [DeGusta, D., Vrba, E.S., 2003.

This approach is typically considered an ""ecomorphological"" method, and has frequently been applied to bovid postcranial remains. Methods for predicting habitat preference from bovid postcrania currently exist for femora, metapodials, and astragali. Here we describe three methods for predicting paleohabitats using measurements of African bovid phalanges (proximal, intermediate, and distal). The proximal phalanx method correctly predicted the habitat preference for 130 of 183 modern bovid specimens (71.0%, 2.8 times better than chance, p < 0.0001). The intermediate phalanx method correctly predicted the habitat preference for 115 of 163 modern bovid specimens (70.6%, 2.8 times better than chance, p < 0.0001). The distal phalanx method correctly predicted the habitat preference for 87 of 122 modern bovid specimens (71.3%, 2.8 times better than chance, p < 0.0001). These accuracies compare well with those of existing such methods (1.8-3.4 times better than chance). Analysis of the probabilities associated with the habitat predictions allows confidence thresholds to be established that identify specific predictions which have <5% chance of being in error. This raises the effective accuracy of the methods to 95%. Extensive exploration and manipulation of the underlying data demonstrate that the habitat predictions are generally robust, and are relatively independent of body weight, taxonomy, and sample composition. These methods are broadly applicable, relatively accurate, and can be used to generate independent predictions of habitat from different elements, and thus constitute a useful approach to inferring past environments. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we sequence the genomes of 137 ancient humans (about 1× average coverage), covering a period of 4,000 years, to understand the population history of the Eurasian steppes after the Bronze Age migrations. We find that the genetics of the Scythian groups that dominated the Eurasian steppes throughout the Iron Age were highly structured, with diverse origins comprising Late Bronze Age herders, European farmers and southern Siberian hunter-gatherers. Later, Scythians admixed with the eastern steppe nomads who formed the Xiongnu confederations, and moved westward in about the second or third century bc, forming the Hun traditions in the fourth-fifth century ad, and carrying with them plague that was basal to the Justinian plague. These nomads were further admixed with East Asian groups during several short-Term khanates in the Medieval period.

The earliest indisputable archaeobotanical remains of broomcorn millet outside of East Asia identified thus far date to the end of the third millennium BC in eastern Kazakhstan. By the end of the second millennium BC, broomcorn millet cultivation had spread to the rest of Central Eurasia and to Eastern Europe. Both millets are well suited to an arid ecology where the dominant portion of the annual precipitation falls during the warm summer months. Indeed, the earliest sites with millet remains outside of East Asia are restricted to a narrow foothill ecocline between 800 and 2000 m a.s.l., where summer precipitation is relatively high (about 125 mm or more, from May through October). Ethnohistorically, millets, as fast-growing, warm-season crops, were commonly cultivated as a way to reduce agricultural risk and were grown as a low-investment rain-fed summer crop. In Eurasian regions with moist winters and very low summer precipitation, the prevailing agricultural regime had long depended on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivated with supplemental irrigation. We propose that the secondary wave of millet cultivation that spread into the summer-dry regions of southern Central Asia is associated with an intensification of productive economies in general, and specifically with the expansion of centrally organized irrigation works. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","agriculture; irrigation; Panicum miliaceum; plant domestication; seasonality; Setaria italica","agricultural intensification; archaeology; barley; climate variation; crop residue; cultivation; domestication; ethnobotany; irrigation system; millet; precipitation (climatology); seasonality; wheat; Central Asia; Eastern Europe; Europe; Far East; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Panicum miliaceum; Setaria italica; Sorghum bicolor; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986317222

However, new genetic studies contradict the identification of these specimens as dogs, questioning the validity of traditional measurements used to morphologically identify canid fossil skulls. We employ 3D geometric morphometric analyses to compare the cranial morphology of Goyet and Eliseevichi MAE to that of ancient and modern dogs and wolves. We demonstrate that these Paleolithic canids are definitively wolves and not dogs. Compared to mesaticephalic (wolf-like breeds) dog skulls, Goyet and Eliseevichi MAE, do not have cranial flexion and the dorsal surface of their muzzles has no concavity near the orbits. Morphologically, these early fossil canids resemble wolves, and thus no longer support the establishment of dog domestication in the Paleolithic.",,"anatomy and histology; animal; audiovisual equipment; dog; evolution; fossil; procedures; skull; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Biological Evolution; Dogs; Fossils; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Models, Anatomic; Skull",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923206653

We use these data to examine dietary differences across time and space within and between populations.Our results show that at the Bronze Age sites of mountainous southern Kazakhstan people consumed C4 plants, likely domesticated millets (Panicum miliaceum and Setaria italica) as supported by previously published archaeobotanical direct evidence. By dating individuals with high δ13C values we find the earliest evidence to date of the consumption of large quantities of millet in Central Asia. By contrast, there is little input of C4 plants to diets of individuals dating to the Bronze Age from northern Kazakhstan. Stable isotope data from later periods show that from the Early Iron Age and continuing through to the Turkic period, C4 plants were a major component of the human food web across the region. The wide variety of stable isotope results, both within and between contemporary sites from the southern regions of Kazakhstan, indicates a diversity of food choice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bronze Age; C4; Central Asia; Millet; Pastoralism; Steppe agriculture","Bronze Age; carbon isotope; cereal; collagen; cultivation; diet; food consumption; isotopic analysis; nitrogen isotope; pastoralism; radiocarbon dating; stable isotope; Kazakhstan; Animalia; Panicum miliaceum; Setaria italica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928327124

The project investigates a population of 356 unimproved Shetland sheep skeletons evenly distributed between females bred at different ages, males and castrates, raised on either high or low nutritional planes. This first instalment focuses on two aspects of our larger study, namely bone growth and epiphyseal fusion as affected by sex, castration and nutrition. Nutrition, sex and castration are shown to influence bone growth in ways that are often element-dependant and not consistent through time. We demonstrate that metric variability (variance) is strongest in males, with little difference between females and castrates, and that, in our sample, nutrition has little influence on variance in any sex cohort. Of importance to the development of models of past animal management this study demonstrates that the standard epiphyseal fusion ranges used by zooarchaeologists are too narrow in most instances and do not account for the large variation between sexes or the lesser variation between planes of nutrition. We recommend methods for recognizing castration and the presence of more than one sheep breed, or type, within the zooarchaeological record. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ageing; Bone growth; Castration; Epiphyseal fusion; Nutrition; Sexing; Zooarchaeology","age determination; aging; archaeology; bone; castration; growth; morphometry; nutritional status; sex determination; sheep; skeleton; Animalia; Ovis aries",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860606016

The results of new faunal analyses of six later Bronze Age sites in Central and Northern Kazakhstan are presented. These studies are based upon the analysis of 63,529 bone fragments, of which 27,023 were identifiable to species and element. These assemblages are compared with 16 other sites in Central and Northern Kazakhstan, and the Trans-Ural region. The herd structures at the final Bronze Age site of Kent are discussed in detail. Analyses of absorbed lipid residues from four sites are also presented. In total, 140 pottery sherds were analysed, of which 73 provided sufficient residues for stable isotope ratio determinations. It is concluded that species proportions are highly variable regionally. Cattle are most prevalent in the forest steppe zone, whilst caprines become more common in semi-arid steppe regions. Proportions of horse are particularly variable, even within environmentally similar areas. Lipid residue results indicate the high prevalence of ruminant dairy products in pottery vessels, whilst faunal data from Kent suggests that cattle husbandry might have been particularly focussed on milk, in comparison with sheep and goats.

We based this appreciation upon the detailed morphology of the distal part of the metapodials. Landmark approaches were applied to archaeological and palaeontological samples from three distinct areas: Switzerland Plateau, Paris Basin, and Charente (France). Little differences of isometric size characterized the three regional samples. Multivariate analyses of shape (principal component analysis, discriminant, canonical variates and neural network analyses) revealed similar sets of complex shape features on both metacarpals and metatarsals. In addition, regional groups appeared clearly differentiated by well defined shape patterns, the functional implications of which remain to be established. These results evidence the existence of a regional structuration of populations (particularly clear on the CVA of both metacarpals and metatarsals) suggesting the absence of long distance migrations. Finally, it appears that the distinction between size and shape systematically operated by geometric morphometrics can provide better insights into the study of the mobility of ancient populations.

We analyzed 74 ancient whole-genome sequences from across Inner Asia and Anatolia and show that the Botai people associated with the earliest horse husbandry derived from a hunter-gatherer population deeply diverged from the Yamnaya. Our results also suggest distinct migrations bringing West Eurasian ancestry into South Asia before and after, but not at the time of, Yamnaya culture. We find no evidence of steppe ancestry in Bronze Age Anatolia from when Indo-European languages are attested there.

Animal physiological and behavioural characteristics affect their suitability to different climatic, topographical and ecological environments. This paper attempts to advance our understanding of the environmental factors constraining animal husbandry on the prehistoric Eurasian steppe, an area that exhibits a broad range of environmental conditions, through comparisons of data on archaeological animal bone assemblages and historic and modern herd compositions (specifically the proportions of cattle, sheep/goats and horse). Results: There are strong biases towards different taxa dependent on region. The consistencies between the later prehistoric animal bone data and the modern and historic livestock herd compositions indicate the constraining role of the environment on the pastoral economies practiced across the Eurasian steppe, in that pastoral strategies appear to be focussing on species best adapted to regional environments. Other patterns may be indicative of socioeconomic trends, such as the relatively low proportions of horse herded in modern times. Conclusions: The results indicate variability in herd compositions across the study area being influenced in part by regional climatic, topographical and ecological conditions. Thus, it is suggested, that part of the variability seen in herd compositions is environmentally determined, with herders making decisions based on the animals' biological and behavioural characteristics. Better understanding of the environmental constraints on pastoral economies will enable us to address a range of questions relating to past pastoralists, and allow us to better assess the cultural factors at play. © 2011, Bendrey; licensee Springer.","Archaeozoology; Climate; Domestic animals; Eurasian steppe; Herd compositions; Pastoralism; Prehistory",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975292492

Specifically, it considers how zooarchaeological evidence can be employed to investigate later-medieval and post-medieval ""improvements"" in animal husbandry. Previous studies of animal bone assemblages have indicated that the size of many domestic species in England increases from the fifteenth century - an observation that has been used to support the writings of those historians that have argued that the Agricultural Revolution occurred several centuries prior to the traditionally ascribed date of 1760-1840. Here, zooarchaeological data are presented which suggest that the size of cattle, sheep, pig and domestic fowl were increasing from as early as the fourteenth century. However, it is argued that the description of these changes as revolutionary is misleading and disguises the interplay of factors that influenced agricultural practice in the post-Black Death period. This paper concludes with a plea for greater awareness of the value of collecting and analysing faunal data from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to enable the historically attested productivity increases of the traditionally dated Agricultural Revolution to be examined archaeologically. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","Agricultural revolution; Animal husbandry; England; Improvement; Zooarchaeology","agricultural history; historical geography; livestock farming; Medieval; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Animalia; Bos taurus; Ovis aries; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-31344441513

International research on Eurasia today reflects the juxtaposition of archaeological theory and practice from distinct epistemological traditions, and migration is at the crux of current debates. Migration was employed paradigmatically during the Soviet era to explain the geography and materiality of prehistoric ethnogenesis, whereas in the west it was harshly criticized in prehistoric applications, especially in the 1970s. Since the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), migration has resurfaced as an important, yet polemical, explanation in both academic arenas. Short- and longdistance population movements are seen as fundamental mechanisms for the formation and distribution of regional archaeological cultures from the Paleolithic to historical periods and as a primary social response to environmental, demographic, and political pressures. Critics view the archaeological record of Eurasia as a product of complex local and regional interaction, exchange, and innovation, reinvigorating essential debates around migration, diffusion, and autochthonous change in Eurasian prehistory. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

Zooarchaeologists have attempted to study these changes osteologically in their search for the geographic and temporal origins of initial animal domestication during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Traditional biometric approaches have explored broad changes in body size over time, but this approach provides poor resolution. Here we investigate whether geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of cranial shape can be used to provide better resolution between wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), since shape is less affected by environmental factors than size. GMM combined with traditional multivariate statistics were applied to the crania of 42 modern domestic pigs (representing 6 breeds), 10 wild×domestic first generation hybrid pigs and 55 adult wild boar. Further analyses were carried out on morphologically discrete portions of the crania to simulate the fragmented nature of archaeological mammal remains. We found highly significant discrimination between wild and domestic pigs, both on the whole crania, and subsets including the parietal, the basicranium, the angle of the nasal and the zygomatic. We also demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate different domestic breeds on the basis of cranial morphology, and that 1st generation hybrid wild×domestic pig morphology more closely resembles wild pigs than domestic, suggesting that a wild phenotype (here represented by morphology) is dominant over a recessive domestic one. Our data demonstrate that GMM techniques can provide a quantifiable, clear classification between wild and domestic Sus (even using partial cranial remains) which has significant implications for zooarchaeological research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Crania; Domestication; Geometric morphometrics; Sus scrofa; Zooarchaeology","archaeology; biometry; body size; domestication; Holocene; morphometry; phenotype; pig; three-dimensional modeling; Animalia; Crania; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892961583

It extends 8 thousand kilometers west to east (from the Black Sea to the Yellow Sea), spanning an area of 8 million sq. km. The beginnings of the ""steppe belt"" cultures coincide with the Copper Age (5th millennium BC) and the activation of the Carpatho-Balkan Metallurgical Province. In the Early and Middle Bronze Age (4th-3rd millennia BC), advanced pastoral cultures emerged in the Circumpontic Metallurgical Province. The appearance of the Maykop culture in the Northern Caucasus represents a signifi cant marking point at that time. Changes were initiated including unambiguous evidence of horse riding (prehistoric cavalry) and the introduction of metal weapons such as shafthole axes and spearheads. In the late 3rd millennium BC, military-oriented stockbreeding societies emerged in Eastern Central Asia (Sayan-Altai and Mongolia). The period around 2000 BC was marked by two migration waves moving in opposite directions. Steppe semi-nomads associated with the Abashevo-Sintashta and later with the Srubnaya-Andronovo communities moved from Eastern Europe eastwards to the Altai and even to Xinjiang. Warring Seima-Turbino groups migrated from Central Asia towards the Urals and further into Eastern Europe. By the mid-2nd millennium BC, the formation of the ""steppe belt"" cultures was completed, and these cultures continued to exist until relatively recently. The stockbreeding societies of the steppes often played a key role in Eurasian history. © 2008.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-56849093201

Zdanovich 1997 ; Kosintsev 2001 ; Nelin 2000 ; Epimakhov 2003). Bronze Age steppe communities illustrate comparatively different scales of social, economic, and political organization, as well as local variability in their extents of mobility and geographic ranges of interaction (e.g., Anthony et al. 2005 ; Chernykh 2004 ; Shishlina 2003 ; Frachetti 2008a). Even in local settings, evidence suggests that Bronze Age steppe communities were organizationally heterogeneous - meaning they were not politically or economically centralized under a shared corpus of functional institutions. Yet widespread distribution of related forms of material culture has prompted archaeologists to define an expansive cultural community through the broad lens of culture history and economic interaction throughout the second millennium bce. One may observe that the emergence of a seemingly extensive socio-economic landscape throughout the Bronze Age stands at odds with the organizationally small-scale and locally rooted societies that occupied this vast territory. Current archaeological models of social complexity to date do not adequately fit the Bronze Age conditions evident across the Eurasian steppe zone (see Koryakova 2002). The apparent disjuncture between the scale of socio-political institutions of steppe populations and the geographic extent of their functional economic arena provides a unique case for the investigation of alternative models of interaction and social complexity among regional communities. © Cambridge University Press 2009 and 2010.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951864744

Accordingly, astragali are an important target for studies seeking to predict the habitat preferences of fossil bovids based on bony anatomy. However, previous work has not tested functional hypotheses linking astragalar morphology with habitat while controlling for body size and phylogenetic signal. This article presents a functional framework relating the morphology of the bovid astragalus to habitat-specific locomotor ecology and tests four hypotheses emanating from this framework. Highly cursorial bovids living in structurally open habitats are hypothesized to differ from their less cursorial closed-habitat dwelling relatives in having (1) relatively short astragali to maintain rotational speed throughout the camming motion of the rotating astragalus, (2) a greater range of angular excursion at the hock, (3) relatively larger joint surface areas, and (4) a more pronounced ""spline-and-groove"" morphology promoting lateral joint stability. A diverse sample of 181 astragali from 50 extant species was scanned using a Next Engine laser scanner. Species were assigned to one of four habitat categories based on the published ecological literature. A series of 11 linear measurements and three joint surface areas were measured on each astragalus. A geometric mean body size proxy was used to size-correct the measurement data. Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) was used to test for differences between habitat categories while controlling for body size differences and phylogenetic signal. Statistically significant PGLS results support Hypotheses 1 and 2 (which are not mutually exclusive) as well as Hypothesis 3. No support was found for Hypothesis 4. These findings confirm that the morphology of the bovid astragalus is related to habitat-specific locomotor ecology, and that this relationship is statistically significant after controlling for body size and phylogeny. Thus, this study validates the use of this bone as an ecomorphological indicator. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Astragalus; Bovidae; Ecomorphology; Functional morphology; Phylogenetic generalized least squares","anatomy and histology; animal; ankle; audiovisual equipment; biomechanics; bone; Bovinae; ecosystem; environment; fossil; phylogeny; physiology; talus; Animals; Ankle Joint; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone and Bones; Cattle; Ecosystem; Environment; Fossils; Models, Anatomic; Phylogeny; Talus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907972120

Cervids are often the most abundant taxon in Eurasian Plio-Pleistocene sites, yet their post-cranial remains are rarely utilized in paleoecological reconstructions. Cervids are found in a wide variety of habitats, and thus their ecomorphology spans an appropriate range to serve as a proxy for paleohabitat. Four morphological features are examined in this study; the calcaneus as a whole (n=122), the medial margin of the patellar surface of the femur (n=133), the lateral margin of the tibial plateau (n=136), and the plantar margin of the third phalanx (n=62). These features were chosen because they represent various aspects of cervid locomotion important for power generation, stability, and substrate interaction. For each feature, canonical variates analyses with cross-validations were used to assess how well landmark configurations distinguish among specimens from different habitat types. Cross-validations returned correct reclassifications rates ranging from 38.9% to 66.3% in a four-habitat system, with resubstitution rates of 55.4% to 79.1% correct.

In this article, we synthesize paleobotanical data from across this broad region and discuss the piecemeal archaeological evidence for agriculture in relation to environmental records of vegetation and climate change. The synthesis shows that agricultural products were present in northern Central Asia by the mid-3rd millennium BC; however, solid evidence for their spread even further north into the Altai Mountains and southern Siberia only comes from the late 2nd and early 1st millennia BC. The earliest crops introduced into Central Asia likely came as a mixed package of free-threshing wheat, naked barley, and broomcorn millet, an assemblage pioneered further south along the northern foothills of the Central Asian mountains. Further east, in Mongolia, and debatably to the west of Central Asia, in the steppe of northern Kazakhstan and the southern Ural region of Russia, the earliest evidence of agriculture (with a similar mixed assemblage) is considerably later, roughly late 1st millennium BC. The lack of clear-cut early evidence for agricultural goods either east or west of the Central Asian mountain belt suggests that agriculture spread northward along these mountains, based on an agropastoral system pioneered millennia earlier at higher elevations of lower latitudes. Additionally, moister regional environmental conditions in the northern mountains after 3000 cal.

Fossils are common throughout the sequence and provide evidence of paleoenvironments and environmental change through time. This study developed discriminant function ecomorphology models that linked astragalus morphology to broadly defined habitat categories (open, light cover, heavy cover, forest, and wetlands) using modern bovids of known ecology. These models used seven variables suitable for use on fragmentary fossils and had overall classification success rates of >82%. Four hundred and one fossils were analyzed from Shungura Formation members B through G (3.4-1.9 million years ago). Analysis by member documented the full range of ecomorph categories, demonstrating that a wide range of habitats existed along the axis of the paleo-Omo River. Heavy cover ecomorphs, reflecting habitats such as woodland and heavy bushland, were the most common in the fossil sample. The trend of increasing open cover habitats from Members C through F suggested by other paleoenvironmental proxies was documented by the increase in open habitat ecomorphs during this interval. However, finer grained analysis demonstrated considerable variability in ecomorph frequencies over time, suggesting that substantial short-term variability is masked when grouping samples by member. The hominin genera Australopithecus, Homo, and Paranthropus are associated with a range of ecomorphs, indicating that all three genera were living in temporally variable and heterogeneous landscapes. Australopithecus finds were predominantly associated with lower frequencies of open habitat ecomorphs, and high frequencies of heavy cover ecomorphs, perhaps indicating a more woodland focus for this genus. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bovidae; East Africa; Hominin; Palaeoecology; Pleistocene; Pliocene","archaeology; ecomorphology; environmental change; fossil; hominid; lithostratigraphy; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; paleontology; Pleistocene; Pliocene; ruminant; Ethiopia; Omo Valley; Australopithecus; Bovidae; Paranthropus; anatomy and histology; animal; antelope; biodiversity; ecosystem; environment; Ethiopia; fossil; hominid; locomotion; paleontology; physiology; ruminant; talus; Animals; Antelopes; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Environment; Ethiopia; Fossils; Hominidae; Locomotion; Paleontology; Ruminants; Talus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957725107

This study provides a geometric morphometric study of cervid rearlimb morphology as it relates to phylogeny, size, and ecomorphology. These methods are then applied to an extinct Pleistocene cervid, Eucladoceros, which is found in some of the earliest hominin-occupied sites in Eurasia. Variation in cervid postcranial functional morphology associated with different habitats can be summarized as trade-offs between joint stability versus mobility and rapid movement versus power-generation. Cervids in open habitats emphasize limb stability to avoid joint dislocation during rapid flight from predators. Closed-adapted cervids require more joint mobility to rapidly switch directions in complex habitats. Two skeletal features (of the tibia and calcaneus) have significant phylogenetic signals, while two (the femur and third phalanx) do not. Additionally, morphology of two of these features (tibia and third phalanx) were correlated with body size. For the tibial analysis (but not the third phalanx) this correlation was ameliorated when phylogeny was taken into account. Eucladoceros specimens from France and Romania fall on the more open side of the habitat continuum, a result that is at odds with reconstructions of their diet as browsers, suggesting that they may have had a behavioral regime unlike any extant cervid.

The central Eurasian steppe (CES) is a focal point for the investigation of the shifting nature of pastoral societies because of the clear transition in archaeological patterning that occurred from the Middle (MBA) to Late Bronze Age (LBA). The spread of LBA (1700–1400 cal BC) Andronovo cultural materials found across wide swaths of the steppe provide indirect evidence for broad scale interactions, but the degree to which people moved across the landscape remains poorly understood.

Strontium isotope results, referenced against the distribution of contemporary bioavailable strontium in the vicinity of both sites, suggest local communities engaged in small-scale mobility with limited ranges. Reduced strontium and oxygen isotopic variation visible in humans from Lisakovsk suggests mobility decreased from the Middle to Late Bronze Age likely indicative of a shift in resource and landscape use over time. © 2017, © Association for Environmental Archaeology 2017.","Andronovo; bioavailable strontium; Bronze Age; Eurasian steppe; Human mobility; landscape use; Sintashta; stable isotopes",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032665729

This has led to the idea that the agricultural Oxus civilisation and non-Oxus mobile pastoralists formed two distinct cultural-economic groups in this region that are easily distinguishable through archaeological remains. Recent excavations of campsites in southern Turkmenistan, however, provide new evidence of variability in exchange between sites, suggesting adaptation by pastoralist groups in their interactions with settled Oxus farming groups. Rather than wholly reiterating or dissolving the distinctions between them, such practices dynamically reshaped the boundaries of these social and economic groups. These findings challenge us to move away from notions of centre-periphery, dependency and diffusion in discussions of intercultural contact in Eurasian prehistory.

However, recent studies suggest that the economic transition between the Iron Age and Roman periods occurred much earlier than previously thought and was partially disconnected from Italy. This article, based on the morphometric analysis of pig teeth and bones, sheds new light on this transition. It reveals a more complex agropastoral change process, in two distinct phases, from the Middle La Tène period and after the creation of the Roman Empire. Moreover, it identifies two large economic models, around the Mediterranean platform and in the temperate part of Europe, with different paces of change, production objectives, and agricultural and market strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Gaul; Iron Age; Morphological changes; Morphometrics; Pig; Roman period; Zooarchaeology","animal husbandry; archaeology; bone; Iron Age; modeling; morphology; morphometry; pig; Roman era; tooth; Europe; Suidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052969680

However, the extent of diversity within husbandry practices across these communities remains unclear, particularly for the Alpine and Swiss Central Plateau regions. Differences in tooth size and shape provide valuable proxies for exploring the history of pig populations and inferring changes to cultural and socio-economic behaviours. Thus, to explore geographical and chronological changes in pig husbandry in Bronze Age Switzerland, we tracked the phenotypic diversification of pig populations using the geometric morphometrics of the second and third lower molars as proxies. Our results confirmed the phenotypic homogeneity of Alpine pig populations during the Bronze Age, both in size and shape. Thus, strong homogeneity appeared to exist in the genetic make-up of pig herds in this area, which can probably be attributed to interactions among the local communities. Conversely, pig populations from the Swiss Central Plateau exhibited a greater diversification in shape between the eastern and western populations, indicating a lack of genetic interaction. In parallel, we observed a significant decline in the size of the east Central Plateau pig population during the Late Bronze Age, possibly due to shifts in husbandry practices induced by changes in forest management. Based on our findings, we hypothesise that geographical, topographical, environmental, and cultural factors influenced local pig husbandry practices and the phenotypic diversity of pig molars between regions in Bronze Age Switzerland. However, further investigations comparing Bronze Age pig populations over a broader scale are required, using genetic and isotopic markers to further test changes in husbandry practices and the genetic diversity. © 2018 The Authors","Bronze Age; Geometric morphometrics; Pig husbandry; Teeth; Zooarchaeology",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049895536

Over the millennia sheep lineages developed which were adapted to the diverse landscapes and climates currently inhabited by the species. With time, human selection also fostered desired traits, such as docility, higher average milk production, abundant fleece or excessive fat depots, amongst others. However, verifying their appearance in the archaeological record is quite difficult applying standard archaeozoological methods. Here we present a Geometric Morphometric (GMM) approach that can shed light on these developments. Our study compares astragali of three wild and five domestic sheep populations. They come from prehistoric contexts in SW Asia dating to the Early Neolithic, Middle Chalcolithic and Late Bronze Age as well as modern reference series housed in natural history collections. We observe that ancient and modern wild sheep share the same astragalar morphology. Moreover, domestic sheep from Middle Chalcolithic Central Anatolia still resemble closely their Neolithic SE Anatolian wild relatives. Modern sheep populations from the United Kingdom and NW Germany form a distinct cluster, whereas sheep populations from Late Bronze Age Syria and particularly modern Karakul sheep clearly position away from all of the aforementioned groups, underscoring their distinct morphology. We conclude that the phenotypes preserved in the astragalar size and shape are at the same time a reflection of the respective population's geography, chronology and genetics. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Archaeozoology; Astragalus; Geometric Morphometrics; Shape; Sheep morphotypes; Size",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058181537
