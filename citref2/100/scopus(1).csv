As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

Eleven statistical techniques are evaluated in reference to one broadly interspecific data set (craniometries of adult Old World monkeys) and one narrowly intraspecific data set (anthropometries of adult Native American males). Three different types of residuals are compared to three versions of shape ratios, and these are contrasted to “cscores,” Penrose shape, and multivariate adjustments based on the first principal component of the logged variance‐covariance matrix; all methods are also compared to raw and logged raw data. In order to help us identify appropriate; methods for size‐adjustment, geometrically similar or “isometric” versions of the male vervet and the Inuit male were created by scalar multiplication of all variables. The geometric mean of all variables is used as overall “size” throughout this investigation, but our conclusions would be the same for most other size variables. Residual adjustments failed to correctly identify individuals of the same shape in both sampkles. Like residuals, cscores are also sample‐specific and incorrectly attribute different shape values to individuals known to be identical in shape. Multivariate “residuals” (e.g., discarding the first principal component and Burnaby's method) are plagued by similar problems. If one of the goals of an analysis is to identify individuals (OTUs) of the same shape after accounting for overalll size differences, then none of these methods can be recommended. We also reject the assertion that size‐adjusted variables should be unciorrelated with size of “size‐free”; rather, whether or not shape covaries with size is an important empirical determination in any analysis. Without explicit similarity criteria, “lines of subtraction” can be very misleading. Only variables in the Mosimann family of shape rations allowed us to identify sized individuals of the same shape (“Iso‐OUTs”). Residuals from isometric lines in logarithmic space, projections of logged data to a plane orthogonal to an isometric vector, and Penrose shape distance based on logged data are also part of this shape family. Shape defined in this manner can be significantly correlated with size in allometric data sets (e.g., guenon craniometrics); ratio shape differences may be largely independent of size in narrowly intraspecific or intrasexual data sets (e.g., Native American anthropometrics). Log‐transformations of shape variables are not always necessary or desirable. We hope our findings enciourage other workers to question the assumptions and utility of residuals as size‐adjusted data and to explore shape and relative size within Mosimann's explicitly geometric framework. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption.

These advances have provoked some controversy. The major aims of this review are to put these debates in context and to provide an overview for the nonmathematician. The purpose of morphometric studies is considered, together with issues relating to the nature, significance and identification of landmarks before turning to a review of available technologies for the analysis of morphological variation. These are considered in terms of underlying models and assumptions in order to clarify when each is appropriate. To illustrate the application of these methods, 3 example studies are presented. The first examines differences amongst ancient and modern adult human crania using 2-dimensional data. The second illustrates the extension of these methods into 3 dimensions in a study of facial growth in monkeys. The third presents an application to the analysis of the form of the hominoid talus. The review ends with an account of available software resources for shape analysis.","Facial variation; Geometric morphometrics; Sexual dimorphism; Shape analysis; Talus","bone development; bone scintiscanning; comparative anatomy; compartment model; computer assisted tomography; craniofacial morphology; evolution; fossil; geometry; human; image analysis; image reconstruction; monkey; morphometrics; nonhuman; priority journal; review; sex difference; species difference; talus; Adult; Animals; Evolution; Fossils; Haplorhini; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Anatomic; Paleontology; Sex Characteristics; Skull; Talus; Crania; Hominidae; Hominoidea; Primates",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033852603

Power surfaces are computed with emphasis on the simplest case of three points in the plane (i.e., landmarks at the vertices of a triangle). Goodall's ([1991] J Roy Stat Soc Serb 53:285-339) F-test was found to have the highest power followed by T2-tests using Kendall tangent space coordinates. Power for T2- tests using Bookstein shape coordinates was good if the baseline was not the shortest side of the triangle. The Rao and Suryawanshi ([1996] Proc Natl Acad Sci 93:12132-12136 and [1998] Proc Natl Acad Sci 95:4121-4125) shape variables had much lower power when triangles were not close to being equilateral. Power surfaces for the EDMA-I T statistic revealed very low power for many shape comparisons including those between very different shapes. Power surface for the EDMA-II Z statistic were also complicated and depended strongly on the choice of baseline used for size scaling. The type I error rate was also often not correct for this method. Results for more than three landmarks are also presented. The implications of the results for practical applications of morphometrics are discussed.

However, the reliability of these hypotheses has never been subjected to external validation. To rectify this, we applied identical methods to equivalent evidence from two groups of extant higher primates for whom reliable molecular phylogenies are available, the hominoids and papionins. We found that the phylogenetic hypotheses based on the craniodental data were incompatible with the molecular phylogenies for the groups. Given the robustness of the molecular phylogenies, these results indicate that little confidence can be placed in phylogenies generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence.

There are several reasons handaxes are used for this purpose, but principal among these is the notion that handaxe shape is an arbitrary imposition of form, on varied raw material, that reflects shared mental templates. If this is so, then changes in handaxe shape through time and space may speak directly to evolving mental capabilities. It is argued here, however, that far too little attention has been paid to much simpler levels of explanation that may say much less about mental capabilities. This point is illustrated by re-examining some data sets that have been used by others to show patterns in handaxe shape interpreted as reflecting differences in mental constructs or for elevated mental abilities. It will be argued here that some very basic factors, such as raw materials and reduction intensity, are better able to explain the observed patterns. As a result, the existence of mental templates for preferred handaxe shapes seems unlikely.

Furthermore, establishing where these covariation patterns may diverge in ontogeny can offer insight into when selection may have acted on development. Here, covariation patterns are compared among adult and non-adult members of the African ape/human clade, in order to address three questions. First, are integration patterns constant among adult African apes and humans? Second, are they are constant in non-adults - i.e. throughout ontogeny? Third, if they are not constant, when do they diverge? Measurements are obtained from 677 crania of adult and non-adult African apes and humans. In order to address the first two questions, correlation matrices and theoretical integration matrices are compared using matrix correlation methods. The third question is evaluated by comparing correlation and variance/covariance patterns, using matrix correlation and random skewers methods, respectively, between adjacent age categories within each species, and between equivalent age categories among the four species. Results show that the hominoids share a similar pattern of ontogenetic integration, suggesting that common developmental/functional integrative processes may play an important role in keeping covariance structure stable across this lineage. However, there are some important differences in the magnitude of integration and in phenotypic covariance structure among the species, which may provide some insight into how selection acted to differentiate humans from the great apes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We extend these formulations in an examination of the forelimb of three callitrichid species (adult Saguinus oedipus, Saguinus fuscicollis, and Callithrix jacchus). We employ principal components analysis to explore the relationship between variance explained by size-and-shape versus shape alone. Independence of shape vectors is examined via correlation analysis. Then we use log shape data to construct intersample (species means) and total sample (between all paris of individuals) matrices of average taxonomic distances. These distance matrices are subjected to cluster analysis and principal coordinate ordinations. Results of principal components analysis suggest that after isometric size is removed, there remains sufficient shape information to discriminate among the three taxa. Careful examination and quantification of the relationships between shape and size suggest that size information (e.g., geometric mean) is fundamental for understanding shape differences within and among callitrichid species; in other words, most aspects of forelimb shape are significantly correlated with size. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we also demonstrate that such correlations are not ""spurious"". Ordinations and clustering of log shape distance matrices (based on means and individuals) support the notion that, despite differences in size, the two tamarins are more similar in shape than either is to C. jacchus (despite size similarity between S. fuscicollis and C. jacchus). Although shape variation in the forelimb of calliirichids may have a functional component, the phylogenetic signal remains strong and serves to group individuals accordingly. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","callitrichids; multivariate statistics; size and shape",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001022934

The first is to assess the applicability of allometric techniques for purposes of predication and comparison, and the second is to test the possibility that the relationship between weight and stature was more significantly different in AL 288-1 (Australopithecus afarensis) and other Plio-Pleistocene hominids than it is in modern humans. It is argued that in the great majority of cases, the reduced major axis (RMA) is the preferred allometric technique. The reason for this is that the slope of the RMA is totally independent of the correlation coefficient. Both the least squares slope (LSR) and the major axis (MA) (which are both highly affected by the correlation coefficient) converge on it as the correlation coefficient approaches unity. It is also argued that the RMA provides the best estimate of the functional relation between the two variables in the analysis when the error variance is unknown, as is most frequently the case in allometric analyses. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the MA produces a particularly spurious best-fit line when the correlation coefficient deviates from unity and the variance of the dependent variable (e.g., body weight) is particularly large in relation to the variance of the independent variable (e.g., stature). This has important implications not only for general allometric analysis but also particularly for the prediction of body weight from skeletal measurements. When RMA is used as the basis of inference and comparison, AL 288-1 (based on the best current estimates for stature and weight) has an inferred weight for its stature that would be highly unusual for modern humans, but similar to that observed for living African apes. OH 62 is similar to AL 288-1 in this respect. © 1992 Academic Press Limited.","allometry; australopithecines; human evolution; line-fitting; stature; weight","alometric technique; human evolution; reduced major axis; weight/stature ratio",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026493627

Acheulean hand-axes were made in a range of sizes, from ca. 8-30 cm in length, and are superficially similar in form at different sizes, even though functional requirements might be expected to vary. To make an appropriate study of three-dimensional form we require a method for analysing size-related change in multiple measures of form. Jolicoeur's multivariate generalization of the allometric equation, (y = bx4), provides a suitable technique, based on the angular relationships of co-ordinates for each measure to the first principal component of the covariance matrix. We have applied this approach to an analysis of several biface assemblages from separate parts of the Kilombe site complex. Allometry is an important component in all the localities, but one area observes a different set of adjustments. We argue that the allometry is probably imposed in response to functional requirements: it suggests that Homo erectus was constrained to follow a number of different guiding principles in the manufacturing process.

For example, some studies have indicated that facial sexual dimorphism arises through ontogenetic scaling, whereas others have found it to be a consequence of both ontogenetic scaling and divergence in male and female growth trajectories. To shed further light on primate facial sexual dimorphism, geometric morphometric methods were applied to crania representing five papionin genera: Cercocebus, Lophocebus, Macaca, Mandrillus and Papio. A first set of analyses focused on the pattern and degree of facial sexual dimorphism exhibited by adult specimens. A second set of analyses concentrated on the ontogeny of facial sexual dimorphism in infant-to-adult age series. The first set indicated that the five genera exhibit significant facial sexual dimorphism. These analyses also revealed that the genera share several features of sexual dimorphism. Males are distinguished from females in having a more prognathic mid-face, a relatively more inferiorly and anteriorly positioned prosthion, relatively increased subnasal height and relatively broader zygomatic roots. They are also differentiated from females in their maxillae, which relative to the zygomatics are narrow but vertically deep, especially in the posterior aspect. Also, the first set of analyses indicated that Macaca is the most distinctive of the genera in terms of sexual dimorphism. The distinctive features of the Macaca sexual dimorphism are that males exhibit relatively wider nasal apertures and premaxillae than females, together with a relative increase in breadth across the inferior zygomatic roots. The second set of analyses demonstrated that in all the genera, sexual dimorphism arises partly through ontogenetic scaling and partly through a late divergence in male and female growth trajectories. The analyses also indicated that the relative contribution of these processes to sexual dimorphism varies among the genera. Ontogenetic scaling is by far the most important process in Lophocebus and Papio. Late divergence between male and female growth trajectories contributes proportionately more in Cercocebus and Mandrillus, although ontogenetic scaling still plays the major role. The relative contribution of late divergence between male and female growth trajectories is greatest in Macaca, in which it accounts for about half of the facial differences between adult males and females. In all five genera, ontogenetic scaling results in increased prognathism and greater relative maxillary size in males compared to females, whilst the late divergence involves the male mid-face becoming proportionately larger and deeper than the female mid-face, and the male posterior maxilla coming to lie more inferiorly with respect to the zygomatic root than its female counterpart.","Baboon; Geometric morphometrics; Macaque; Mangabey; Ontogeny; Sexual dimorphism","ontogeny; primate; sexual dimorphism; Cercocebus; Crania; Lophocebus; Macaca; Mammalia; Mandrillus; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Primates; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036282288

Despite the importance of the concept of symmetry to studies of early human development, its current use is usually based on loose qualitative assessment. A more informative approach would be to use a continuous scale of this shape property rather than the strict current language of ""more"" or ""less"". A symmetry measurement tool has been developed, which is based on evaluation of the minimal distances that the vertices of a structure have to move in order to attain the required symmetry. Using this Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) method, it is possible to evaluate quantitatively how much symmetry exists in a non-symmetrical configuration and how the nearest symmetrical shape looks. We test and demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of this approach on handaxe samples from three Lower Paleolithic sites in Israel, Ubeidiya, Gesher Benot Ya'aqov and Ma'ayan Barukh, representing various stages in the Acheulian Techno-complex of the Levant.

The paper gives a review of the archaeology of Kariandusi, and then investigates the question of size and shape variation in bifaces. The Upper Sites at Kariandusi, first investigated by L. S. B. Leakey, have yielded many obsidian bifaces which can be dated to approximately 0.7-1.0 myr ago. Material from the Lower Site, including many lava bifaces, is judged to be stratigraphically younger but probably in the same time range. We show by making comparisons with the neighbouring Acheulean sites of Kilombe and the Kapthurin Formation that allometry is present in biface assemblages at least 0.5 myr different in date; that similar principles of allometry operate in all the assemblages; and that where there are differences of allometric pattern, within-site variation is sometimes greater than variation between distant sites. We conclude that the size of a biface at least partly determines the shape in which it was made, and that sites in the time range of Homo erectus and early Homo sapiens show surprisingly similar allometric patterns. © 1994 Cambridge University Press.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008390919

Wild Atlantic salmon smolts differed in shape from hatchery-reared smolts. This difference was less pronounced, but still statistically significant when wild adults were compared with hatchery-reared adults captured in the coastal drift-net fishery after a year spent at sea.

Recently, geometric techniques have been developed for the direct analysis of landmark data. In this paper, we offer a summary (with examples) of three of these newer techniques, namely shape coordinate, thin-plate spline and relative warp analyses. Shape coordinate analysis detected significant craniofacial variation between 4 modern human populations, with African and Australian Aboriginal specimens being relatively prognathous compared with their Eurasian counterparts. In addition, the Australian specimens exhibited greater basicranial flexion than all other samples. The observed relationships between size and craniofacial shape were weak. The decomposition of shape variation into affine and non-affine components is illustrated via a thin-plate spline analysis of Homo and Pan cranial landmarks. We note differences between Homo and Pan in the degree of prognathism and basicranial flexion and the position and orientation of the foramen magnum. We compare these results with previous studies of these features in higher primates and discuss the utility of geometric morphometrics as a tool in primatology and physical anthropology. We conclude that many studies of morphological variation, both within and between taxa, would benefit from the graphical nature of these techniques. © 1996 S.

Within that framework, predictions are made about the spatial and temporal patterning expected if morphology is functional and/or stylistic. These expectations are then tested through comparison, using discriminant function analysis, of stone tools from the Late Prehistoric in nw North America and the Late Pleistocene in northern Africa. The comparison reveals that the tools, etulscrapers, vary only in terms of their amount of wear; their morphology is identical between the samples separated by 10,000 years in time and 5,000 miles in space. Based on the theoretical discussion and these observations, it is argued that endscraper morphology is entirely functional, and contains no stylistic component.

Recently, it has been claimed that homoiologies are widespread in the hominid skull, especially in those regions affected by mastication-related strain, and that their prevalence is a major reason why researchers have so far been unable to obtain a reliable estimate of hominid phylogeny. To evaluate this ""homoiology hypothesis,"" we carried out analyses of a group of extant primates for which a robust molecular phylogeny is available-the papionins. We compiled a craniometric dataset from measurements that differ in their susceptibility to mastication-related strain according to developmental considerations and experimental evidence. We used the coefficient of variation and analysis of variance with post hoc least significant difference comparisons in order to evaluate the variability of the measurements. The prediction from the homoiology hypothesis was that dental measurements, which do not remodel in response to strain, should be less variable than low-to-moderate-strain measurements, and that the latter should be less variable than high-strain measurements. We then performed phylogenetic analyses using characters derived from the measurements and compared the resulting phylogenetic hypotheses to the group's consensus molecular phylogeny. The prediction was that, if the homoiology hypothesis is correct, the agreement between the craniometric and molecular phylogenies would be best in the analyses of dental characters, intermediate in the analyses of low-to-moderate-strain characters, and least in the analyses of high-strain characters. The results of this study support the suggestion that mastication-related mechanical loading can result in variation in hominid cranial characters. However, they do not support the hypothesis that homoiology is a major reason why phylogenetic analyses of hominid crania have so far yielded conflicting and weakly supported hypotheses of relationship. These findings are consistent with a recent test of the homoiology hypothesis using craniodental data from extant hominoids, and cast doubt on the validity of the homoiology hypothesis, as originally formulated. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
