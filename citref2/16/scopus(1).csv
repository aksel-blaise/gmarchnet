Until now, the lack of suitable calibrated multi-view image datasets with known ground truth (3D shape models) has prevented such direct comparisons. In this paper, we first survey multi-view stereo algorithms and compare them qualitatively using a taxonomy that differentiates their key properties. We then describe our process for acquiring and calibrating multi-view image datasets with high-accuracy ground truth and introduce our evaluation methodology. Finally, we present the results of our quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art multi-view stereo reconstruction algorithms on six benchmark datasets.

The question addressed is how the three dimensional structure and motion of objects can be inferred from the two dimensional transformations of their projected images when no three dimensional information is conveyed by the individual projections. The following scheme is proposed: (i) divide the image into groups of four elements each; (ii) test each group for a rigid interpretation; (iii) combine the results obtained in (ii). It is shown that this scheme will correctly decompose scenes containing arbitrary rigid objects in motion, recovering their three dimensional structure and motion. The analysis is based primarily on the ""structure from motion"" theorem which states that the structure of four non-coplanar points is recoverable from three orthographic projections. The interpretation scheme is extended to cover perspective projections, and its psychological relevance is discussed.",,"article; biological model; computer; depth perception; human; movement perception; pattern recognition; physiology; Computers; Depth Perception; Form Perception; Humans; Models, Biological; Motion Perception",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018790505

Anthropometry measurements were obtained from 20,015 survey participants. The anthropometric measures included weight, height, recumbent length, circumferences, limb lengths, and skinfold thickness measurements. Results The tables in this report include weighted population means, standard errors of the means, and selected percentiles of body measurement values. Because measurements varied by sex and age (as well as race and ethnicity in adults), results are reported by these subgroups.

The study examines the relationship between stature and dimensions of hands and feet among Rajputs of Himachal Pradesh - a North Indian endogamous group. The purpose for understanding these examinations was the paucity in the literature of studies that allow the reconstruction of stature from various dimensions of hands and feet amongst Rajputs. Hand length, hand breadth, foot length and foot breadth of 246 subjects comprising 123 males and 123 females ranging in age from 17 to 20 years were taken independently on left and right side of each individual. Statistical analyses indicated that the bilateral variation was insignificant for all the measurements except hand breadth in both the sexes (P < 0.01). Sex differences were found to be highly significant for all the measurements (P < 0.01). Linear and multiple regression equations for stature estimation were calculated using the above mentioned variables. The correlation coefficients between stature and all the measurements of hands and feet were found to be positive and statistically significant. The highest correlation coefficient between stature and foot length and lowest SEE (standard error of estimate) indicate that the foot length provides highest reliability and accuracy in estimating stature of an unknown individual.

However, to date the method has not been tested specifically on high latitude individuals, whose body form in some ways more closely approximates that of earlier higher latitude humans (i.e., large and broad-bodied). In this study, anthropometric data for 67 Alaskan Inupiat and 54 Finnish adults were used to test the stature/bi-iliac body mass estimation method. Both samples are very broad-bodied, and the Finnish sample is very tall as well. The method generally works well in these individuals, with average directional biases in body mass estimates of 3% or less, except in male Finns, whose body masses are systematically underestimated by an average of almost 9%. A majority of individuals in the total pooled sample have estimates to within ±10% of their true body masses, and more than three-quarters have estimates to within ±15%. The major factor found to affect directional bias is shoulder to hip breadth (biacromial/ bi-iliac breadth). Male Finns have particularly wide shoulders, which may in part explain their systematic underestimation. New body mass estimation equations are developed that include the new data from this study. When applied to a sample of earlier (late middle Pleistocene to early Upper Paleolithic) higher latitude skeletal specimens, differences between previous and new body estimates are small (less than 2%). However, because the Finns significantly extend the range of morphological variation beyond that represented in the original world-wide reference sample used in developing the method, thereby increasing its generality, it is recommended that these new formulas be used in subsequent body mass estimations. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

To elucidate these shifts further, diaphyseal cross- sectional morphology was analyzed by using cross-sectional areas and second moments of area of the mid-distal humerus and midshaft femur. The humeral diaphysis indicates a gradual reduction in habitual load levels from Eurasian late archaic, to Early Upper Paleolithic early modern, to Middle Upper Paleolithic early modern hominids, with the Levantine Middle Paleolithic early modern humans being a gracile anomalous outlier.

The site has long been recognised for the preservation of sediments containing Early Pleistocene fauna and flora, but since 2005 has also yielded humanly made flint artefacts, extending the record of human occupation of northern Europe by at least 350,000 years. The sediments consist of sands, gravels and laminated silts laid down by a large river within the upper reaches of its estuary. In May 2013 extensive areas of the laminated sediments were exposed on the foreshore. On the surface of one of the laminated silt horizons a series of hollows was revealed in an area of ca. 12 m2. The surface was recorded using multi-image photogrammetry which showed that the hollows are distinctly elongated and the majority fall within the range of juvenile to adult hominin foot sizes. In many cases the arch and front/back of the foot can be identified and in one case the impression of toes can be seen. Using foot length to stature ratios, the hominins are estimated to have been between ca. 0.93 and 1.73 m in height, suggestive of a group of mixed ages. The orientation of the prints indicates movement in a southerly direction on mud-flats along the river edge. Early Pleistocene human fossils are extremely rare in Europe, with no evidence from the UK. The only known species in western Europe of a similar age is Homo antecessor, whose fossil remains have been found at Atapuerca, Spain. The foot sizes and estimated stature of the hominins from Happisburgh fall within the range derived from the fossil evidence of Homo antecessor. © 2014 Ashton et al.",,"article; artifact; body height; estuary; Europe; fauna; flora; footprint test; fossil hominin; Lower Pleistocene; photography; Pleistocene; river; sand; United Kingdom; Western Europe; animal; evolution; foot; fossil; hominid; sediment; Animals; Biological Evolution; Foot; Fossils; Geologic Sediments; Great Britain; Hominidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895758867

These features have been interpreted as evidence that ecological changes of the LGM played a critical role in cultural and biological adaptation in European UP populations. In areas outside of Europe, similar environmental changes occurred with the LGM. This analysis introduces postcranial material from the Late Upper Paleolithic (LUP) of North Africa and Southeast Asia and tests two related hypotheses: 1) LUP samples across the Old World had similar patterns of postcranial robusticity and 2) relative to an available Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) sample, regional LUP samples demonstrate similar trends in robusticity that may be attributable to climatic effects of the LGM. Cross-sectional geometric data of the humeri and femora were obtained for 26 EUP and 100 LUP humans from Europe, Africa, and Asia. Despite regional differences, LUP samples are similar relative to the EUP sample. In the humerus, bilateral asymmetry decreases in all LUP samples relative to the EUP sample. In the femur, LUP samples demonstrate increasingly circular femoral mid-shaft sections, reflecting reduced anteroposterior bending strength relative to the EUP sample. These patterns suggest changes in subsistence behavior and mobility after the LGM across the Old World that are most consistent with reduced mobility and broad-spectrum resource exploitation. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Cross-sectional geometry; Late Pleistocene; North Africa; Southeast Asia","article; bone structure; climate change; environmental change; Europe; evolutionary adaptation; female; femur; geographic distribution; human; human tissue; humerus; male; North Africa; phenotypic variation; skeleton; Southeast Asia; Upper Pleistocene; Adaptation, Biological; Body Size; Climate; Femur; Fossils; Humans; Humerus; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247614883

For static foot geometry foot length and foot width were quantified in a standing position. Dynamic foot geometry and loading were assessed during walking on a walkway with self selected speed (Novel Emed X, 100Hz, 4sensors/cm 2). Contact area (CA), peak pressure (PP), force time integral (FTI) and the arch index were calculated for the total, fore-, mid- and hindfoot.Results show that most static and dynamic foot characteristics change continuously during growth and maturation. Static foot length and width increased with age from 13.1 ± 0.8. cm (length) and 5.7 ± 0.4. cm (width) in the youngest to 24.4 ± 1.5. cm (length) and 8.9 ± 0.6. cm (width) in the oldest. A mean walking velocity of 0.94 ± 0.25. m/s was observed. Arch-index ranged from 0.32 ± 0.04 [a.u.] in the one-year old to 0.21 ± 0.13 [a.u.] in the 5-year olds and remains constant afterwards.This study provides data for static and dynamic foot characteristics in children based on a cohort of 7788 subjects.

However, because complete postcranial fossils with reliable taxonomic attributions are rare, efforts to estimate hominin mass and stature are complicated by the frequent albeit necessary use of isolated, and often fragmentary, skeletal elements. The recent discovery of 1.52 million year old hominin footprints from multiple horizons in Ileret, Kenya, provides new data on the complete foot size of early Pleistocene hominins as well as stride lengths and other characteristics of their gaits. This study reports the results of controlled experiments with habitually unshod Daasanach adults from Ileret to examine the relationships between stride length and speed, and also those between footprint size, body mass, and stature. Based on significant relationships among these variables, we estimate travel speeds ranging between 0.45 m/s and 2.2 m/s from the fossil hominin footprint trails at Ileret. The fossil footprints of seven individuals show evidence of heavy (mean = 50.0 kg; range: 41.5-60.3 kg) and tall individuals (mean = 169.5 cm; range: 152.6-185.8 cm), suggesting that these prints were most likely made by Homo erectus and/or male Paranthropus boisei. The large sizes of these footprints provide strong evidence that hominin body size increased during the early Pleistocene. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bipedalism; Body size; Homo; Human evolution; Pleistocene","bipedalism; body mass; body size; footprint; fossil; hominid; human evolution; Pleistocene; taxonomy; velocity; walking; Kenya; Homo erectus; Paranthropus boisei",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877671882

In order to study morphological differences among ceratopsian postcranial elements and to compare evolutionary patterns, multivariate (Principal Components Analysis) and bivariate methods were used to analyze linear measurement data, and the shape methods Resistant-Fit Theta-Rho Analysis (RFTRA), Least-Squares Theta-Rho Analysis (LSTRA), and Euclidean Distance Matrix Analysis (EDMA) were applied to biological landmark data. Results of the analyses show that size is the primary change through ceratopsian skeleton evolution. Elements display positive allometry, and increasing structural support is evident, especially in the radius and fibula. Phylogenetic distribution of ceratopsian postcrania agrees with the skull material included in recent cladistic analyses. Psittacosaurus elements are in many ways derived relative to those of non-ceratopsid neoceratopsians, and evidence suggests that Psittacosaurus was bipedal, while non-ceratopsid neoceratopsians were not, except maybe for Udanoceratops. With increasing body size, neoceratopsian limbs bowed laterally. The variety of methods allows for unbiased interpretation of results, provides more information than any one method, and provides controls for each other. However, sample sizes are not ideal, and all results should be treated with caution at this time. © 2004 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.",,"dinosaur; evolution; fossil; morphometry; Ceratopsia; Dinosauria; Neoceratopsia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-5044251588

The 21 dimensions include weight, height, sitting height, popliteal height, knee height, buttock popliteal length, buttock knee length, acromion olecranon length, elbow wrist length, foot length, foot breadth, hand length, hand breadth, chest breadth, chest depth, elbow elbow breadth, seat breadth, thigh clearance, chest girth, waist girth, and hip girth. All dimensions increase almost linearly with age from 6 through 11 years. Although there is considerable overlap, sex differences are apparent, but vary with the dimensions examined. For example, in eight dimensions (three of the hands and feet and five relating to the breadth and girth of the torso) boys are generally larger throughout the age range. Girls are generally larger through the age range in five measurements, all of which involve the buttock and thigh areas. In the remaining measurements, the pattern of sex differences indicates larger male values at 6, 7, and sometimes 8 years of age, small and/or negligible sex differences at 8 and 9 years, and larger female values at 10 and 11 years of age. The pattern indicated in the last measurements probably reflects the initial stages of the earlier female adolescent growth spurt. The discussion of results is directed toward the specific application of anthropometric information to the human engineering of middle childhood, e.g., in the design of clothing, furniture, and equipment for children.

Sexual maturity was reached in males at approximately 126 mm snout-vent length (SVL), and in females by 122 mm SVL. Mean SVL for mature males is approximately 161 SVL, and for mature females, at most 149 mm SVL. Although the last dimension predicts a mean hatchling SVL of approximately 50 mm based on data from extant squamates, the relationship between mean SVL of mature females and mean SVL of hatchlingmeonate in squamates is quite variable. As a result, a mean value of 40.4 mm SVL for several tiny isolated individuals of Keichousaums is well within the 95 percent confidence ellipse calculated from data from extant squamates. Therefore, there is not reason to postulate that the common occurrence of tiny individuals of between 33.5 mm and 48.2 mm SVL is the result of spontaneous abortions. © 2009 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.",,"anatomy; discriminant analysis; life history; paleontology; principal component analysis; reptile; sexual dimorphism; sexual maturity; Reptilia; Sauropterygia; Squamata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-67651092288

The Harris-Beath Mat for footprinting was the device used for measuring foot length. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate linear regression models. All statistical models were found to be significant and indicated that both right and left foot length were independent predictors of either height or weight. From all models fitted, the model having the greater predictive value was described by the formula: height (cm) = 34.113 + 3.716 × (right foot length (cm)) + 1.558 (if girl) + 2.499 × (age(years)), R2 = 0.852.

Due to the perfect conservation in rock salt a great number of organic materials have been found, among mostly wooden artefacts. Currently, the major archaeological focus is on the Bronze Age salt mining activities with excavations taking place at the historic Christian von Tusch-Werk, Alter Grubenoffen mine. Chronology building started at the Dachstein plateau, in the vicinity of Hallstatt, where tree-trunks were discovered in an alpine lake (Schwarzer See) and after recovery a spruce-larch chronology was compiled that dates back to 1475 BC. In addition, at the bog Karmoos, very close to the mining place of Hallstatt, preserved trees were intensively sampled resulting in a spruce chronology reaching even 1523 BC. Over 500 samples were taken at the Christian von Tusch-Werk, Alter Grubenoffen. They also included samples from the recently discovered world's oldest wooden staircase. The spectrum of wooden species encompassed Norway spruce, Silver fir, beech, European larch and maple. We were able to synchronize 128 samples, ending in a 282-year long floating chronology. While the staircase dated back to 1344 BC, the end year of the floating chronology dated even to 1245 BC. Tree felling dates showed clusters within the chronology, providing evidence for archaeologists to find construction phases and usage periods. The Dachstein-Hallstatt spruce chronology currently holds 840 synchronized series, and includes samples from the lake at the Dachstein, from the Karmoos bog at Hallstatt, from the prehistoric Hallstatt salt mine, and from historical buildings, as well as living trees. The chronology covers the period between 1523 BC through 2004 AD. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

The fundamental importance of integrating both osteological and ichnological data, when investigating locomotor and behavioural hypotheses, is highlighted. This approach could also contribute positively to the complex cognitive process of trackmaker identification and be favourable for the attainment of a more natural definition of ichnotaxa. © Cambridge University Press 2016.","Cretaceous; dinosaurs; footprints; Italy; Ornithomimosauria; palaeobiogeography","Cretaceous; dinosaur; footprint; morphometry; paleobiogeography; trackway; Italy; Dinosauria; Ornithomimosauria; Theropoda",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978132167

The basis for inferring this timing is clarified, in view of recent objections to its previous inference. In any case, wolves (Canis lupus), the ancestral species, and behaviorally modern humans have co-existed for much longer than that. Why dogs evolved when they did, and not sooner, lies in part in the precarious ecological dynamics confronted by many animals in Late Pleistocene times. A particular lineage of wolves successfully navigated those dynamics by becoming incorporated into human society. Relatively recent evolutionary models suggest that reduced fear and greater capability to cope with the stress associated with environments increasingly populated by people at this time likely characterized the founding stock. Recent genetic assessments have been interpreted as perhaps implying that the particular wolf subspecies giving rise to dogs has become extinct. While possible, an alternative explanation for the documented genetic patterns is that the subspecies lineage in question ceased to exist as a phenotype, but survived and thrived evolutionarily as dogs. In a very real sense, dogs are wolves. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Behavior; Dog; Domestication; Extinction; Genetics; Late Pleistocene; Morphology; Sociality; Wolf",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937044718

During their evolutionary history, caseids transitioned from small faunivorous tetrapods such as Eocasea martini (reaching ~20 cm total length), to gigantic herbivores such as Cotylorhynchus hancocki (reaching almost 7 m in length). In this analysis, morphometric techniques (i.e. Principal Component Analysis, Reduced Major Axis (regression) slopes) and phylogenetic methods (construction of metric trees) were used in a comparative and integrated way in order to study the major changes in the long bones in the course of caseid evolution, and identify in which nodes and terminal branches more extreme repatterning of structures is concentrated. The analysis showed a decoupling between the long bones of the fore- and hindlimbs, with the hind leg remaining more conservative and congruent to a basal pattern. By contrast, the forelimbs (especially the ulna and radius) show greater restructuring in the course of evolution, with an allometric strengthening not limited to species of very large size. An overbuilt appendicular skeleton was detected as early as taxa small to medium in size, indicating that the strengthening is not related in a simple and linear way to a structural response to gigantic body size. Because this robust structure is already present in small- to medium-sized taxa, it may have been subsequently exapted, allowing to reach the colossal body size of more derived members of Caseidae, which rank among the largest reached throughout the Palaeozoic. © 2017 Lethaia Foundation.

The reliability of this character has been evaluated by means of principal component analysis on several well-preserved footprints (both manus and pes) referred to as Ichniotherium sphaerodactylum from the Early Permian Tambach Formation (Thuringia, Germany). The analysis reveals a substantial variability of digit impression length (especially in the manus), relativizing the validity of digit IV length as a diagnostic character as practised in different ichnological studies. Regarding the use of such a character, results clearly suggest the need to preliminarily conduct explorative analysis on the whole available ichnological material in order to detect which digit is the most consistent from an ichnotaxonomical standpoint, thus avoiding an arbitrary selection.

Recent re-examination revealed the tooth of another older and smaller dog, making this domestic dog burial not only the oldest known, but also the only one with remains of two dogs. This observation brings the total known Magdalenian dogs to nine. Domestication of dogs during the final Palaeolithic has important implications for understanding pre-Holocene hunter-gatherers. Most proposed hunter-gatherer motivations for domesticating dogs have been utilitarian. However, remains of the Bonn-Oberkassel dogs may offer another view. The Bonn-Oberkassel dog was a late juvenile when it was buried at approximately age 27–28 weeks, with two adult humans and grave goods. Oral cavity lesions indicate a gravely ill dog that likely suffered a morbillivirus (canine distemper) infection. A dental line of suggestive enamel hypoplasia appears at the 19-week developmental stage. Two additional enamel hypoplasia lines, on the canine only, document further disease episodes at weeks 21 and 23. Pathological changes also include severe periodontal disease that may have been facilitated by immunodeficiency. Since canine distemper has a three-week disease course with very high mortality, the dog must have been perniciously ill during the three disease bouts and between ages 19 and 23 weeks. Survival without intensive human assistance would have been unlikely. Before and during this period, the dog cannot have held any utilitarian use to humans. We suggest that at least some Late Pleistocene humans regarded dogs not just materialistically, but may have developed emotional and caring bonds for their dogs, as reflected by the survival of this dog, quite possibly through human care. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dog; Domestication; Human-animal-bond; Pleistocene; Upper palaeolithic; Wolf","canid; domestication; hunter-gatherer; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; settlement history; tooth; Animalia; Canis familiaris; Morbillivirus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041601643

Reconstructions nominate the use of proto and early dogs in hunting and hauling as underwriting changes in subsistence technology, catalyzing human population growth and supporting the spread of modern humans at the expense of Neanderthals. These reconstructions assume that the use of canids in hunting will always have profound impacts on human subsistence. In this paper, I summarize existing quantitative data derived from the ethnographic record to evaluate productivity gains derived from the use of dogs in hunting. To augment this sparse information, I present some of the only data on the deployment of unspecialized Central African dogs (basenji's) by hunter-gatherers. These data show that while dogs can enhance hunting returns in certain circumstance, their overall impact on hunting productivity is highly variable and often restricted to specific prey types. Furthermore, the complex circumstances surrounding the emergence and spread of dogs globally precludes simple applications of these data to the archaeological record. These data invite a reexamination of when and how we expect dogs to have a significant impact on human subsistence and the circumstances that supported the emergence and spread of canids as effective hunting aids. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Dogs; Ethnoarchaeology; Evolution; Hunter-gatherers; Upper Paleolithic",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019834142

However, the old human method of expert track reading has first been employed on these tracks in 2013 (as in some other caves with preserved human tracks from the Pleistocene). This special knowledge was deployed by three trackers from the Ju/'hoansi-San in Namibia who enriched our knowledge on the tracks in Pech-Merle in two significant ways: five individuals were identified, aged from 9–10 to over 50 years, from both sexes and some footprints were found that hitherto had been overlooked. It turned out that the features crucial for their interpretation are congruent with those of morpho-metric measurements but their experience based interpretation is more fine-grained than an interpretation based on the available statistics alone.

Aims: To determine if there is a correlation between foot-length and weight, length and surface area and to compare the drug doses calculated as per predicted weight (determined on the basis of foot-length) with those calculated on the basis of actual weight. Material and Methods: Weight, length and foot-length of children aged up to 24 months were determined in the prospective study. Analysis was done using simple linear regression analysis and by determination of coefficient of determination. The dosages of emergency medications (epinephrine, atropine, Ringer's lactate and diazepam) were calculated on the basis of actual weight and dosages given in standard text and were then compared with dosages likely to be administered on the basis of weight predicted by foot-length measurement. Results: Five hundred subjects were enrolled in the study that demonstrated a significant linear relationship between foot-length and body weight (r2 = 0.88, p&lt;0.01), total length (r2 = 0.88, P&lt;0.01) and body surface area (r2 = 0.84, P&lt;0.01). The weight could be predicted on the basis of the following formula: Weight (kg)= -5.15 + [1.35 x foot-length (cm)]. The doses of drugs calculated on the basis of weight predicted from foot-length were exceeded the standard dose by 2.35-2.40%. Conclusions: In children aged up to 2 years, foot-length can be used to predict weight and calculate doses of emergency drugs.","Anthropometry; Critical care; Foot-length; Infant; Surface area; Weight","adrenalin; atropine; diazepam; Ringer lactate solution; analytic method; article; body height; body weight; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; emergency; female; foot; human; intensive care; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; preschool child; statistical significance; Body Height; Body Weight; Body Weights and Measures; Female; Foot; Humans; India; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33644529734

The specimen is a short‐statured male about 25 years old and shows no other especially peculiar skeletal irregularities, except for high negative angles of femoral torsion. We discuss a number of possible etiologies for the anomalous absence of the lesser trochanters. The condition is most likely a result of an epigenetic effect or a traumatic avulsion of both lesser trochanters. If the absence of normal development of the lesser trochanters involves a congenital condition, it is an extremely rare, previously undescribed trait. If the condition results from bilateral traumatic avulsion, it is probably the result of excessive muscular stress on the proximal femur and provides further evidence of hardship of life in Paleolithic populations and of the ability of these people to survive debilitating trauma.

Since 2009, a team incorporated in the Projet Collectif de Recherche “Grotte de Cussac”, directed by J. Jaubert, has been engaged in the identification, inventory and study of these “Activity Traces” (TrAcs). The objective is to study the interactions of humans and animals with this subterranean environment and to understand how humans perceived this complex space. Our aim is to confront the data associated with these TrAcs with the information provided by other disciplines. This approach is made possible by the conditions of the discovery of the cave, which was left almost untouched since the Paleolithic, and the strict policy of conservation that has been implemented. The team explores the cave in a non-invasive manner, respecting the limits of a designated pathway while recording, describing, and photographing the accessible TrAcs. The areas that are currently inventoried show that human TrAcs are more frequent and diverse than those of animals, and consist mostly of prints, tracked surfaces and black and red marks. Most of the animal TrAcs were produced by bears, and consist mainly of claw marks covering large areas. These bear marks always predate the human activities. The presence of TrAcs, art and human remains shows that this entire subterranean environment was intensively frequented by both humans and bears. Our approach constitutes a fundamental step towards an understanding of the cave, and more generally, of the identity and culture of Gravettian groups, reflected here in their behavior, activities and occupations in the context of this complex site with monumental engravings and human remains. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Cave art; Ichnology; Preservation; Subterranean context; Traces; Upper Paleolithic","animal; human activity; ichnology; Paleolithic; preservation; rock art; subterranean environment; trace fossil; Aquitaine; Cussac Cave; Dordogne; France; Animalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003794075

Archaeothanathological information on the human skeletal remains was recovered from diaries, field pictures and notes, and data from recent excavations was integrated. The secondary deposits have traditionally been interpreted as older burials that were disturbed to make space for new inhumations. Our results suggest that those disturbances were not casual: older burials were intentionally displaced to bury younger inhumations. Subsequently, some skeletal elements, especially crania, were arranged around the new burial; these were often placed within stone niches. Based on the composition of some clusters, which contain the bones of two individuals displaced together, it is possible that a double burial composed of two adults was originally present at the site. This would be a burial type that had not been recognized at Arene Candide until now. Strikingly, this potential double burial contained an individual showing pathological bowing of the limbs, a finding which is not infrequent in skeletons from Gravettian and Epigravettian multiple burials. In addition, the crania and other skeletal elements derived from this burial were intentionally placed around a new inhumation, whose skeleton possibly shows a milder form of the same disease (possibly hereditary rickets). This and other observations suggest that the five individuals belonging to the second phase of this “cemetery” (AMS dates spanning 12,030 – 11,180 cal BP) might have been buried over a relatively brief time span. Our study demonstrated similar behaviors in the first phase of mortuary use of the cave (12,820 – 12,420 cal BP), indicating a remarkable persistence in Final Epigravettian funerary models despite their archaeologically apparent rarity and intermittent nature. © 2019, Istituto Italiano di Antropologia.
