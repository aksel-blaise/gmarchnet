As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

Body mass, as the 'size' variable against which other morphological features are usually judged, has been important for assessing these changes. Yet past body mass estimates for Pleistocene Homo have varied greatly, sometimes by as much as 50% for the same individuals. Here we show that two independent methods of body-mass estimation yield concordant results when applied to Pleistocene Homo specimens. On the basis of an analysis of 163 individuals, body mass in Pleistocene Homo averaged significantly (about 10%) larger than a representative sample of living humans. Relative to body mass, brain mass in late archaic H. sapiens (Neanderthals) was slightly smaller than in early 'anatomically modern' humans, but the major increase in encephalization within Homo occurred earlier during the Middle Pleistocene (600-150 thousand years before present (kyr BP)), preceded by a long period of stasis extending through the Early Pleistocene (1,800 kyr BP).",,"article; body mass; brain size; evolution; femur; fossil; priority journal; taxonomy; Animals; Body Constitution; Body Weight; Brain; Evolution; Female; Femur Head; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Male; body mass; encephalization; Homo; Pleistocene; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030619670

Using both theoretical mechanical models and empirical observations within Recent humans, scaling relationships between structural properties and bone length are developed. The influence of body shape on these relationships is considered. These scaling factors are then used to standardize structural properties for comparisons with pre‐Recent Homo (Homo sp. and H. erectus, archaic H. sapiens, and early modern H. sapiens). Results of the comparisons lead to the following conclusions: 1) There has been a consistent, exponentially increasing decline in diaphyseal robusticity within Homo that has continued from the early Pleistocene through living humans. Early modern H. sapiens are closer in shaft robusticity to archaic H. sapiens than they are to Recent humans. The increase in diaphyseal robusticity in earlier Homo is a result of both medullary contraction and periosteal expansion relative to Recent humans. 2) There has been no similar temporal decline in articular robusticity within Homo–relative femoral head size is similar in all groups and time periods. Thus, articular to shaft proportions are different in pre‐Recent and Recent Homo. 3) These findings are most consistent with a mechanical explanation (declining mechanical loading of the postcranium), that acted primarily through developmental rather than genetic means. The environmental (behavioral) factors that brought about the decline in postcranial robusticity in Homo are ultimately linked to increases in brain size and cultural‐technological advances, although changes in robusticity lag behind changes in cognitive capabilities. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

More specifically, skeletal samples of normal modern Euroamericans, prehistoric and early historic Amerindians, and prehistoric Japanese show moderate (ca. 5–14%) median asymmetry in diaphyseal cross‐sectional areas and polar second moments of area, whereas the tennis‐player sample, with pronounced unilateral physical activity, exhibits median asymmetries of 28–57% in the same parameters. A sample of Neandertals with nonpathological upper limbs exhibits similarly low articular asymmetry but pronounced diaphyseal asymmetries, averaging 24–57%. In addition, three Neandertals with actual or possible post‐traumatic upper limb alterations have the same low articular asymmetry but extremely high diaphyseal asymmetries, averaging 112–215%. These data support those from experimental work on animals, exercise programs of humans, and human clinical contexts in establishing the high degree of diaphyseal plasticity possible for humans, past and present, under changing biomechanical loading conditions.

In locations where shape or protection are of prime importance the bone's architecture is achieved during growth under direct genetic control. In locations where resistance to repetitive loading is important only the general form of the bone will be achieved as a result of growth alone, the remaining characteristics result from functional adaptation. This mechanism ensures that bone architecture is modelled and remodelled until prevailing strains match those genetically prescribed for that location. For this match to be established, and subsequently maintained, bone cells must be able to 'assess' feedback derived directly or indirectly from the functional strains produced within the tissue. These strains are therefore the objective of functionally adaptive remodelling, and the stimulus for its control. Evans was the first person to refer to the recording of functional strains from gauges attached to bone in vivo. This technique has allowed quantitative investigations on bone's normal functional strain environment, and its adaptive response to changes in its state of strain. Recent investigations have extended to the immediate effects of dynamic strains on the structure of the bone matrix, and the biochemical behaviour of the resident bone cells. Such studies should reveal the mechanism by which strains within the matrix are transduced into the biochemical signals by which adaptive remodelling is controlled. © 1987.",,"BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS - Bone; ADAPTIVE BONE REMODELING; BONE TISSUE FUNCTIONAL STRAIN; LOAD-RELATED FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATION; OSTEOGENIC LOADING STRAIN; STRAIN RELATED OSTEOCYTE ACTIVATION; BIOMECHANICS; bone; human; model; stimulus; Animal; Bone and Bones; Bone Development; Bone Resorption; Human; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023516779

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption. We consider the implications of these findings in terms of the potential for these approaches in the study of comparative growth in related species.","Facial remodelling; Geometric morphometrics; Thin plate spline analysis","age; allometry; article; cercocebus; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; face growth; female; geometry; male; molar tooth; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; sex difference; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Anthropometry; Bone Remodeling; Cercocebus; Facial Bones; Female; Male; Models, Anatomic; Sex Characteristics; Cercocebus; Cercocebus torquatus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031724058

Plant foods are almost invisible in the archeological record, and it is impossible to estimate accurately their dietary importance. However, stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) analysis of mammal bone collagen provides a direct measure of diet and has been applied to two Neanderthals and various faunal species from Vindija Cave, Croatia. The isotope evidence overwhelmingly points to the Neanderthals behaving as top-level carnivores, obtaining almost all of their dietary protein from animal sources. Earlier Neanderthals in France and Belgium have yielded similar results, and a pattern of European Neanderthal adaptation as camivores is emerging. These data reinforce current taphonomic assessments of associated faunal elements and make it unlikely that the Neanderthals were acquiring animal protein principally through scavenging.

Results of these analyses are used to interpret the femoral morphology of three pre‐Recent Homo juveniles—the H. erectus KNM‐WT 15000 and the archaic H. sapiens La Ferrassie 6 and Teshik‐Tash 1—as well as observed differences in postcranial morphology between adult Recent and earlier Homo (Ruff et al., 1993). Our findings indicate the following: (1) There are age‐related changes in long‐bone diaphyseal envelope sensitivity to increased mechanical loading, with the periosteal envelope more responsive prior to mid‐adolescence, and the endosteal envelope more responsive thereafter. The periosteal expansion and endosteal contraction of the diaphysis documented earlier for adult pre‐Recent Homo relative to Recent humans (Ruff et al., 1993) is thus consistent with a developmental response to increased mechanical loading applied throughout life. The relatively large medullary cavity in the 11–12‐year‐old KNM‐WT 15000 femur is also consistent with this model. However, the two archaic H. sapiens juveniles show relatively small medullary cavities, possibly indicating a modified developmental pattern in this group. (2) Articulations follow a growth pattern similar to that of long‐bone length (and stature), while cross‐sectional diaphyseal dimensions (cortical area, second moments of area) show a contrasting growth pattern, with slower initial growth from childhood through mid‐adolescence, followed by a “catch‐up” period that continues through early adulthood. This latter pattern is more similar to the growth curve for body weight, and may in fact partially reflect adaptation of the diaphysis to increased weight bearing. Because of these different growth patterns, articulations appear relatively large, and diaphyseal breadths relatively small during late childhood to mid‐adolescence (i.e., about 9–13 years), when compared to adults from the same population. KNM‐WT 15000 shows this same proportional difference from adult early Homo specimens, which is therefore interpreted as simply a developmental consequence of his age at death. (3) When standardized for differences in body size and shape, midshaft femoral cross‐sectional areas for the three pre‐Recent juveniles in our sample, which span an age range from about 4 to 12 years, all fall in the upper part of the general data scatter for modern juveniles of a similar age. This is very similar to the pattern we found earlier for adult Homo specimens (Ruff et al., 1993).

The purpose of morphometric studies is considered, together with issues relating to the nature, significance and identification of landmarks before turning to a review of available technologies for the analysis of morphological variation. These are considered in terms of underlying models and assumptions in order to clarify when each is appropriate. To illustrate the application of these methods, 3 example studies are presented. The first examines differences amongst ancient and modern adult human crania using 2-dimensional data. The second illustrates the extension of these methods into 3 dimensions in a study of facial growth in monkeys. The third presents an application to the analysis of the form of the hominoid talus.

There is a consistent decline in sexual dimorphism from hunting-gathering to agricultural to industrial subsistence strategy levels in properties which measure relative anteroposterior bending strength of the femur and tibia in the region about the knee. This trend parallels and is indicative of reductions in the sexual division of labor, in particular differences in the relative mobility of males and females. Sexual dimorphism in mediolateral bending strength near the hip shows no consistent temporal trend, probably reflecting relatively constant sex differences in pelvic structure related to the requirements of childbirth. Upper and Middle Paleolithic samples are indistinguishable in terms of sexual dimorphism from modern huntergatherers, suggesting a similar sexual division of labor. The results illustrate the utility of cross-sectional geometric parameters of long bone diaphyses in reconstructing behavioral differences within and between past populations. Some variations in the accuracy of sexing techniques based on diaphyseal measurements of the lower limb long bones may also be explained by these behavioral and structural factors. © 1987.","biomechanics; lower limb skeleton; sexual dimorphism","evolution; female; fossil; human; human cell; labor; leg; male; sex difference",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023631482

However, neither of these considerations can explain the subsequent decrease in maximum pelvic breadth relative to stature in larger more recent hominids. It is shown here that this increase in relative linearity of the body with an increase in body size is consistent with basic thermoregulatory principles. Specifically, to maintain a constant surface area/body mass ratio, absolute body breadth should remain constant despite differences in body height. Variation among modern humans supports the prediction: populations living in the tropics vary greatly in stature, but show little variation in body breadth. In contrast, populations living in colder climates have absolutely wider bodies, and thus lower surface area/body mass, regardless of stature. All African early hominids-small australopithecines as well as the very tallHomo erectus KNM-WT 15000-have absolute body breadths within the modern human tropical-subtropical range; variations in relative body linearity are due almost entirely to variations in stature. A later hominid from a cold temperate climate (the Kebara 2 Neandertal) has an absolutely wide body, similar to living higher latitude populations. Thermoregulatory constraints on absolute body breadth, together with obstetric and biomechanical factors, may have contributed to the evolution of the rotational birth process and secondary altriciality with increased body and brain size inHomo erectus. Thermoregulatory considerations also suggest that AfricanH. erectus would most likely have been limited to relatively open/dry environments, while australopithecines could have inhabited either open/dry or closed/wet environments. © 1991 Academic Press Limited.","ecogeographic rules; hominids; pelvis; thermoregulation","body shape; climate; hominid; human evolution",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026281782

Anthropologists use postcranial robusticity to infer the activity levels of prehistoric populations, and changes in robusticity are often used to support scenarios of adaptive change. These scenarios explain differences in morphology as the result of a change in lifestyle (habitual activity). One common scenario posits that early modern humans were more gracile than Neandertals because the modern humans’ complex culture required less physical exertion. However, lifestyle is only one of many influences on morphology. Climate has clear correlations with physique and skeletal proportions. Analysis of recent humans that differ in terms of lifestyle and climatic adaptations reveals that limb bone robusticity varies with climate as much as or more than with lifestyle. Many of the differences in robusticity between Neandertals and early modern humans appear to be related to climatic adaptations. The results support the single-recent-origin model of modern human origins. The differences in robusticity between Neandertals and early modern humans suggest that population replacement rather than local evolution best explains the emergence of modern humans in Europe. Both climatic adaptations (primarily body proportions) and lifestyle should be considered in analyses of robusticity. © 2000 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

Yet bending requires greater bone mass than axial compression for effective support of equivalent static loads. Most long bones, in fact, are curved along their length; their curvature augmenting rather than diminishing stresses developed due to bending. The most ""efficient"" design of a bone (maximal strength per unit mass) should be a form which is straight and resists axial compression. Bone curvature and the bending developed in the long bones of most species studied, therefore, poses a paradox in design. However, under natural conditions an animal's skeleton must support a range of dynamic loads that vary in both direction and magnitude. Thus, improved predictability of dynamic loading should represent an important feature in the design of the bone, in addition to its absolute strength. We present an explanation of long bone curvature, based on the conditions of stability for bending vs. axial compression in a column, that describes this apparent design paradox as a mechanism for improving the predictability of loading direction (and, consequently, the pattern of stresses within the bone). Our hypothesis argues that in order to understand the design ""effectiveness"" of long bone shape the role of the bone as a structural unit must be redefined to one in which bone strength is optimized concurrently with loading predictability. In agreement with our hypothesis, bone curvature appears to meet this requirement. © 1988 Academic Press Limited All rights reserved.",,"biomechanics; mammal; nonhuman; theoretical study; Animal; Biomechanics; Bone and Bones; Dogs; Mammals; Models, Anatomic; Running; Stress, Mechanical; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023927889

To asses the implications of the anatomical distribution of these lesions, we have assigned them to one of seven regions: head/neck, trunk, shoulder/arm, hand, pelvis, leg and foot. The resultant distributions, both including and deleting injuries indicated only by post-traumatic degenerations and from Shanidar 1, were compared to anatomical lesion distributions for three Recent human archaeological samples (Bt-5, Libben and a pooled Nubian one), three modern clinical samples (late 20th century Albuquerque, early 20th century London and late 19th century New York City), and a specialized athletic sample (North American Rodeo performers). The majority of the Neandertal samples (as adjusted) are highly significantly different from the six normal Recent human samples, with only the most trimmed Neandertal sample being non-significantly different from the New York sample. However, all of the Neandertal distributions provide a close match to the Rodeo traumatic lesion pattern, primarily as a result of a high incidence of head & neck trauma. Although small sample size, preservation and a dearth of older individuals with inhibited mobility may contribute to the Neandertal lesion distribution, the similarity to the Rodeo lesion distribution suggests frequent close encounters with large ungulates unkindly disposed to the humans involved. © 1995.","human paleontology; Neandertals; stress; trauma",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001568077

A review of previously published Neanderthal collagen isotopic signatures with the addition of 3 new collagen isotopic signatures from specimens from Les Pradelles allows us to compare the dietary habits of 5 Neanderthal specimens from OIS 3 and one specimen from OIS 5c. This comparison points to a trophic position as top predator in an open environment, with little variation through time and space. In addition, a comparison of the Saint-Césaire I Neanderthal with contemporaneous hyaenas has been performed using a multi-source mixing model, modified from Phillips and Gregg (2003, Oecologia 127, 171). It appears that the isotopic differences between the Neanderthal specimen and hyaenas can be accounted for by much lower amounts of reindeer and much higher amounts of woolly rhinoceros and woolly mammoth in the dietary input of the Neanderthal specimen than in that of hyaenas, with relatively similar contributions of bovinae, large deer and horse for both predators, a conclusion consistent with the zooarchaeological data. The high proportion of very large herbivores, such as woolly rhinoceros and woolly mammoth, in Neanderthal's diet compare to that of the scavenging hyaenas suggests that Neanderthals could not acquire these prey through scavenging. They probably had to hunt for proboscideans and rhinoceros. Such a prey selection could result from a long lasting dietary tradition in Europe. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In general, changes in mobility alter patterns of bending of the midshaft femur and tibia, resulting in changes in diaphyseal robusticity and shape. This relationship between levels of mobility and lower limb diaphyseal structure was used to test the hypothesized decrease in mobility. Cross-sectional geometric data were obtained for 81 Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic European femora and tibiae. The sample was divided into three time periods: Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP), Late Upper Paleolithic (LUP), and Mesolithic (Meso). In addition, because decreased mobility often results in changes in sex roles, males and females were analyzed separately. All indicators of bending strength decrease steadily through time, although few of the changes reach statistical significance. There is, however, a highly significant change in midshaft femur shape, with LUP and Meso groups more circular in cross-section than the EUP sample, supporting archeologically based predictions of decreased mobility. Sexual dimorphism levels in diaphyseal strength remain low throughout the three time periods, suggesting a departure in Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic foragers away from the pattern of division of labor by sex observed in modern hunter-gatherers. Results confirm that the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum represents a crucial stage in Late Pleistocene human evolution, and signals the appearance of some of the behavioral adaptations that are usually associated with the Neolithic, such as sedentism. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Bone strength; Mesolithic; Mobility; Upper Paleolithic","adolescent; adult; agriculture; anatomy; animal; animal hunting; anthropometry; archeology; article; bone strength; Europe; evolution; female; femur; fossil; histology; hominid; human; leg; locomotion; male; methodology; paleoclimatology; paleontology; physiology; sex difference; sexual development; tibia; Adolescent; Adult; Anatomy, Cross-Sectional; Animals; Anthropometry; Europe; Evolution; Female; Femur; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Leg; Locomotion; Male; Sex Characteristics; Tibia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142245581

Conflicting evidence as to the relative importance of these factors complicates our ability to interpret variation in robusticity in the past. It remains unclear how the pattern of robusticity in the skeleton relates to adaptive constraints on skeletal morphology. This study investigates variation in robusticity in claviculae, humeri, ulnae, femora, and tibiae among human foragers, relative to climate and habitual behavior. Cross-sectional geometric properties of the diaphyses are compared among hunter-gatherers from southern Africa (n = 83), the Andaman Islands (n = 32), Tierra del Fuego (n = 34), and the Great Lakes region (n = 15). The robusticity of both proximal and distal limb segments correlates negatively with climate and positively with patterns of terrestrial and marine mobility among these groups. However, the relative correspondence between robusticity and these factors varies throughout the body. In the lower limb, partial correlations between polar second moment of area (J0.73) and climate decrease from proximal to distal section locations, while this relationship increases from proximal to distal in the upper limb. Patterns of correlation between robusticity and mobility, either terrestrial or marine, generally increase from proximal to distal in the lower and upper limbs, respectively. This suggests that there may be a stronger relationship between observed patterns of diaphyseal hypertrophy and behavioral differences between populations in distal elements. Despite this trend, strength circularity indices at the femoral midshaft show the strongest correspondence with terrestrial mobility, particularly among males. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adaptation; Biomechanics; Cross-sectional geometry; Foragers; Selection","animal hunting; arm; article; clavicle; climate; diaphysis; female; femur; femur shaft; habitual adaptation; human; humerus; male; marine environment; morphological adaptation; skull; tibia; ulna; Adaptation, Physiological; Africa, Southern; Anthropometry; Body Constitution; Bone and Bones; Climate; Diet; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Locomotion; Male; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748657999

The strain data showed that during locomotion the cranial (longitudinally concave) cortex was the tension surface and the caudal (longitudinally convex) cortex was the compression surface. (This relationship between bending and curvature is the reverse of that which occurs in the radius of the same species).The principal strain directions remained almost constant throughout the main strain period of each stride and were practically unaffected by the speed of locomotion. On neither the cranial nor the caudal surface of the tibia was the larger principal strain aligned along the long axis of the bone. On the cranial surface it formed a proximal and lateral angle of 29 degrees with this axis and on the caudal surface, a similar angle of 23 degrees. This strain pattern is consistent with a loading regimen of craniocaudal bending and torque. The mean peak principal strain on the cranial and caudal surfaces of the bone during walking in five sheep was +709 and -666 microstrain, respectively (ratio, 1.07 to one). In eight sheep the mean thickness of the cranial cortex was 3.0 millimeters and of the caudal cortex, 2.87 millimeters (ratio, 1.03 to one). The directions of secondary osteons in the cranial and caudal cortices of the tibia in these eight sheep were shown to lie between the direction of the long axis of each bone and that of the larger principal strain in that cortex during locomotion. Determinations of the transverse axes of the proximal and distal joint surfaces of the tibia in adult sheep and in sheep in late fetal life showed that during postnatal development the distal end of the bone rotates internally some 14 degrees with respect to the proximal end. The limited strain data available from the tibia of a human suggest that the tibial torque during locomotion is in the same direction in both sheep and humans. The developmental rotation of the tibia in these species, however, is in the opposite direction.",,"animal experiment; biomechanics; bone; development; sheep; tibia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018408051

This collagen presents a similar amino acid composition to modern collagen. An isotopic difference between collagen of herbivorous and carnivorous species is clearly documented in this paper and it is shown that the decrease of the amount of collagen in bones and teeth through diagenesis has not altered the original isotopic signal. It has been possible to demonstrate the carnivorous diet of Neanderthals. In addition, more subtle isotopicdifferences have been documented between the different species within each trophic group consumed. These differences can be linked to physiology, or to particular kinds of food of each animal species. Another isotopic signal due to nursing effects has also been observed. A young mammal suckling its mother's milk is one trophic level higher than an adult of the same species. Consequently, the collagen of deciduous teeth records an isotopic signal from the food consumed before weaning. Also, in species where most of the tooth growth occurs before weaning time, the collagen of permanent teeth records, in part, information about the milk diet. Thus the 15N composition of such teeth is different from the isotopic composition of bones in the same individual. The variation of the 15N composition of bone collagen along the stratigraphical sequence of the site shows that this isotopic signal may also be used for the palaeoclimatic reconstruction; for example, evidence of an arid period is seen in the layer #7 in Marillac. © 1995 Academic Press Limited.","1 Mammals; Carbon Isotopes; Collagen; Marillac; Neanderthals; Nitrogen isotopes; Palaeoecosystem",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002137526

In this paper, we revisit the rules of palaeodietary reconstruction using collagen stable isotopes and reassess the possible isotopic signatures of potential protein resources available to prehistoric humans. It appears that the interpretation of the human's isotopic signature does not necessarily imply a significant proportion of aquatic-derived protein in the diet neither for Neandertal nor for first anatomically modern humans in Europe. Exploitation of aquatic ecosystems by humans needs to be supported by further zooarchaeological evidence. Nevertheless, isotopic biogeochemistry of fossil human collagen can be very useful in palaeodietary reconstructions provided that basic rules are followed while selecting samples of coeval fauna, in order to establish the end members of different food resources. Significant progress investigating the evolution of subsistence strategies in fossil hominids is expected from a combination of zooarchaeological and isotopic data.

Mechanically relevant morphological variables include the strength of the diaphysis relative to body size, asymmetry between antimeres, diaphyseal shape, and sexual dimorphism in mechanical properties. This study compares the long bone robusticity of humeri, ulnae, femora and tibiae of Later Stone Age foragers from the forest and fynbos biomes of the southern African Cape region (n=65:32m,33f), dated primarily to between 8000 and 2000 BP. Ecological differences between these biomes dictate variation in the terrestrial resource base, although marine contributions to diet are significant throughout the Cape. Female robusticity remains relatively homogenous between the forest and fynbos biomes, and is characterized by relative symmetry in strength characteristics between paired upper limb elements with antero-posteriorly strengthened diaphyses. This morphology is consistent with shellfish harvesting and the use of digging sticks throughout the Later Stone Age in these regions. Male lower limb robusticity is consistently high in both biomes, suggesting that high levels of terrestrial mobility were characteristic of male subsistence strategies. The forest biome males have higher levels of bilateral asymmetry in upper-limb robusticity than males of the fynbos biome. This morphology may correspond with increased unilateral loading resulting from a higher frequency of use of spear projectiles relative to bows and arrows, and greater exploitation of medium to large sized bovids. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

These recordings confirmed that during locomotion the cranial surface of this bone was subjected to longitudinal tension and the caudal surface to longitudinal compression. During walking, the peak compression strain on the caudal surface was 1.8 times as great as the peak tension strain on the cranial surface. In both growing and adult animals the more highly strained caudal cortex had a lower ash content and a lower elastic modulus than the less highly strained cranial cortex. Values of elastic modulus and ash content were highly correlated both between cortices and between age groups. The differences between cortices in modulus and ash appeared to be closely related to the greater degree of osteonal remodelling in the more highly strained cortex. The ratio of peak walking stress between the caudal and cranial cortices was calculated to be 1.6:1. The stress values suggest that at every stride during walking, the cranial and caudal cortices of the sheep radius are loaded to within the same proportion of their respective yield stress. © 1979.",,"BIOMECHANICS - Research; STRAIN - Measurements; STRESSES - Measurements; BONE REMODELING; BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS; animal experiment; biomechanics; bone; bone remodeling; cortical bone; radius; sheep; young modulus; Animal; Biomechanics; Bone and Bones; Elasticity; Female; Locomotion; Radius; Sheep; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018648102

Cross-sectional biomechanical analysis of these femoral remains, however, documents that the perceived differences in overall strength are largely the product of contrasting ecogeographically related body proportions; once these proportions are taken into account and diaphyseal strength measures are appropriately scaled, any differences in overall shaft hypertrophy disappear. At the same time, clear differences in midshaft shape remain, with slightly more antero-posterior strength in the early modern human sample and more medio-lateral reinforcement in the late archaic human sample. It remains unclear to what extent these differences, as well as structural similarities in the subtrochanteric region, might be due to differences in body shape and especially pelvic and hip proportions. In combination with contrasts in femoral neck-shaft angles, it remains possible that the similarities in overall robusticity may hide a subtle mosaic of differences in factors contributing to that uniformity.","Biomechanics; Femur; Human palaeontology; Modern humans; Neandertals","Paleolithic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033117498

Such activity patterns imply high energy requirements; yet it has been argued that Neandertals were also inefficient foragers. The Present study addresses this apparent conflict by estimating energy needs in Neandertals and then evaluating those estimates in the context of energetic and foraging data compiled for contemporary human foragers and nonhuman primates. Energy demands for Neandertals were determined by first predicting basal metabolic rates (BMR) from body weight estimates using human standards developed by the World Health Organization [FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) Energy and Protein Requirements. Report of the Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Export Committee, Geneva: WHO]. Total daily energy expenditure (kcal/ day) was then estimated assuming high levels of physical activity (i.e., 2-3 × BMR), comparable to those observed among subsistence-level populations today. These estimates of energy requirements (ranging from 3000-5500 kcal/day) were then used to determine Neandertal foraging efficiency assuming (1) minimal survival-level foraging returns, and (2) daily foraging times longer than those observed among any contemporary foraging group and comaparable to a nonhuman primate. Even with these extremely conservative parameters, estimates of Neandertal foraging efficiency (∼800-1150 kcal/h foraged) were comparable to those observed among living hunter-gatherers. These results indicate that if Neanderthals did have heavy activity levels, as implied by their skeletal robusticity, they would have required foraging efficiencies within the range observed among modern groups. Thus, Neandertals could have been either highly active or poor foragers, but they could not have been both. © 2001 Academic Press.","Adaptation; Basal metabolism; Foraging efficiency; Hominid evolution; Physical activity level; Total energy expenditure","energetics; foraging efficiency; Neanderthal",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034936701

Traditionally, these contrasts in femoral shape have been explained as the result of the elevated activity levels and limited cultural abilities of Neandertals. More recently, however, researchers have realized that many of these femoral differences may be explained by the cold-adapted bodies of Neandertals vs. the warm-adapted bodies of near-modern humans. This study explicitly tests this proposed link between climate-induced body proportions and femoral shape by considering the entire hip as a unit by using geometric morphometric methods adapted to deal with articulated structures. Based on recent human patterns of variation, most contrasts in shape between the femora of Neandertals and near-modern humans seem to be secondary consequences of differences in climate-induced body proportions. These results, considered in light of hip mechanics during growth, highlight the importance of developmental and functional integration in determining skeletal form.",,"adaptation; anthropology; article; biomechanics; bone development; bone growth; climate; cultural factor; femur; hip; human; morphometrics; physical activity; priority journal; Animals; Biomechanics; Body Constitution; Climate; Femur; Fossils; Hip Joint; Hominidae; Humans; Species Specificity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038133429

In human societies, fertility is primarily influenced by individual decision-making, as well as socially accepted norms of behavior. Many factors influence mortality in human populations. Among the latter, nutrition in the form of diverse essential nutrient intake may greatly influence maternal and fetal-to-infant mortality. Nutritional ecology is the study of the relationship between essential nutrient intake and its effects on human demographic patterns. A demographic revolution occurred in Europe during OIS 3: all Neandertal populations were either subsumed within populations of Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens (AMHS) (genetic swamping) or they were eliminated altogether. Evidence from stable isotopes, faunal remains, and the paleopathology of human skeletons suggest that Neandertals consumed a low diversity diet centered on large and medium-sized terrestrial herbivores. In contrast, populations of early AMHS consumed a slightly more diversified diet. The effect of this dietary shift would have resulted in greater diversity of essential nutrient intake and lower maternal and fetal-to-infant mortality, which in turn would have sparked population increases during the early phases of occupation of the European continent by populations of AMHS. Greater diversity of essential nutrient intake by early populations of AMHS may have been one factor that led to the replacement of Neandertals in Europe during OIS 3.",,"extinction; Neanderthal; nutrition; paleoecology; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18244406528

Indirect associations between cold climate and Neandertal morphology have also been advanced: Midfacial prognathism, dolichocephaly, occipital bunning, and other characteristics may have been the consequences of genetic drift in small populations of foragers isolated from the rest of the world by Alpine and continental ice sheets. Either way, when we think of Neandertals we think of primitive humans that endured the climatic and ecological hardships of cold periglacial Europe.

These features have been interpreted as evidence that ecological changes of the LGM played a critical role in cultural and biological adaptation in European UP populations. In areas outside of Europe, similar environmental changes occurred with the LGM. This analysis introduces postcranial material from the Late Upper Paleolithic (LUP) of North Africa and Southeast Asia and tests two related hypotheses: 1) LUP samples across the Old World had similar patterns of postcranial robusticity and 2) relative to an available Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) sample, regional LUP samples demonstrate similar trends in robusticity that may be attributable to climatic effects of the LGM. Cross-sectional geometric data of the humeri and femora were obtained for 26 EUP and 100 LUP humans from Europe, Africa, and Asia. Despite regional differences, LUP samples are similar relative to the EUP sample. In the humerus, bilateral asymmetry decreases in all LUP samples relative to the EUP sample. In the femur, LUP samples demonstrate increasingly circular femoral mid-shaft sections, reflecting reduced anteroposterior bending strength relative to the EUP sample. These patterns suggest changes in subsistence behavior and mobility after the LGM across the Old World that are most consistent with reduced mobility and broad-spectrum resource exploitation. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Cross-sectional geometry; Late Pleistocene; North Africa; Southeast Asia","article; bone structure; climate change; environmental change; Europe; evolutionary adaptation; female; femur; geographic distribution; human; human tissue; humerus; male; North Africa; phenotypic variation; skeleton; Southeast Asia; Upper Pleistocene; Adaptation, Biological; Body Size; Climate; Femur; Fossils; Humans; Humerus; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247614883

To assess whether its habitual mechanical loading patterns from manipulative and locomotor behaviour were more similar to those of Middle Palaeolithic or earlier Upper Palaeolithic humans, we compared its long bone shaft geometric properties to those of European Neanderthals and early modern humans. As appropriate, body proportions of Neanderthals and European early modern humans were employed to scale diaphyseal strength. Saint-Cesaire 1 is similar to Neanderthals in its rounded proximal femoral shaft, lack of a femoral pilaster and rounded tibial crests, but it contrasts with Neanderthals in its pronounced humeral deltoid tuberosity and dorsally projecting medial femoral buttress. In other diaphyseal cross-sections it is similar to members of both samples. In the lower limb, Saint-Cesaire 1 resembles both samples in robusticity when given Neanderthal proportions, but it appears hyper-robust when earlier Upper Palaeolithic human proportions are used. Its femoral midshaft exhibits the greater medio-lateral rigidity of the Neanderthals but resembles early modern humans in its elevated antero-posterior strength. The femoral diaphyseal shapes fit best with a model of Neanderthal pelvic and hip proportions, combined with an early modern human emphasis on antero-posterior loading of the femoral midshaft. In the upper limb, its cortical area distribution is closer to those of the Neanderthals, but its proximal diaphyseal shapes provide a mixed pattern. This Chatelperronian hominid therefore provides a mosaic in terms of diaphyseal loading patterns, but the load levels and patterns are reasonable for a Late Pleistocene human only if it is provided with the hyper-arctic body proportions of a Neanderthal.","Biomechanics; Body proportions; Early modern humans; Neanderthals; Postcrania","archaeological evidence; bone; morphology; France; Hominidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033405426

Elevated postcranial robusticity and sexually dimorphic mobility patterns are presumed consequences of this strategy, in which males are attributed greater robusticity and mobility than females. Much of the basis for these trends originates from populations where skeletal correlates of activity patterns are known (e.g., cross-sectional geometric properties of long bones), but in which activity patterns are inferred using evidence such as archaeological records (e.g., Pleistocene Europe). Australian hunter-gatherers provide an opportunity to critically assess these ideas since ethnographic documentation of their activity patterns is available. We address the following questions: do skeletal indicators of Australian hunter-gatherers express elevated postcranial robusticity and sexually dimorphic mobility relative to populations from similar latitudes, and do ethnographic accounts support these findings. Using computed tomography, cross-sectional images were obtained from 149 skeletal elements including humeri, radii, ulnae, femora, and tibiae. Cross-sectional geometric properties were calculated from image data and standardized for body size. Australian hunter-gatherers often have reduced robusticity at femoral and humeral midshafts relative to forager (Khoi-San), agricultural/industrialized (Zulu), and industrialized (African American) groups. Australian hunter-gatherers display more sexual dimorphism in upper limb robusticity than lower limb robusticity. Attributing specific behavioral causes to upper limb sexual dimorphism is premature, although ethnographic accounts support sex-specific differences in tool use. Virtually absent sexual dimorphism in lower limb robusticity is consistent with ethnographic accounts of equivalently high mobility among females and males. Thus, elevated postcranial robusticity and sexually dimorphic mobility do not always characterize hunter-gatherers. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Aborigines; Cross-sectional geometry; Long bones; Mobility; Subsistence strategy","Aborigine; archeology; article; Australia; computer assisted tomography; ethnography; female; femur; human; humerus; long bone; male; osteometry; radius; sex difference; skeleton; tibia; ulna; Australia; Bone and Bones; Female; Humans; Male; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547876184

The metrical expression of anterior femoral curvature therefore is not a useful feature of racial assessment for separating these two South American Indian groups from Whites and American Negroes. Femora of American Negro and White individuals with low ponderal indices were found to be less bowed than the norms for their race; individuals with high ponderal indices were more bowed than the norm for their race. The assumed genetic basis for expression of anterior femoral curvature suggested by Stewart ('62) and Walensky ('65) seems to be a feature of human plastic response to body weight rather than to temporal, clinal, postural or equestrian influences.

Sex and side differences were generally found to be small, race differences however, in both sexes, are striking. When used with other established criteria, these data on femora will be of value in identifying skeletons of certain racial groups. It seems likely that inherent racial differences provide the substrate, as well as set the developmental limitations, for any modifications which may be imposed by function. The basic curvature may be modified or maintained by variations in the inherited physical properties of the femur. The response of these physical properties to the demands of differing extrinsic influences must also be of importance in determining the amount and location of femoral curvature.

This study explores quantitatively the curvature of the long bones in 13 species of anthropoid primates and analyzes the functional consequences of curvature in biomechanical terms. These analyses demonstrate that, whereas the humeri of gibbons and spider monkeys are functionally less curved than those of other taxa, the ulnae of brachiators are neither more nor less curved than those of other anthropoids, and the gibbon radius is far more curved than would be predicted from body size alone. The humerus is likely significantly less curved in brachiators because of its torsion‐dominated loading regime and the greatly increased stress magnitude developed in torsionally loaded curved beams. The large curvature of the radius is localized in the region of attachment of the supinator muscle. Analysis presented here of muscle mass allometry in catarrhines demonstrates that gibbons are characterized by an extremely massive supinator, and the large radial curvature is therefore most likely due to forearm muscle mechanics. This study also demonstrates that the overall pattern of limb bone curvature for anthropoids is distinct from the pattern reported for mammals as a whole. This distinctive scaling relationship may be related to the increased length of the limb bones of primates in comparison to other mammals.

In particular, one group, the Neandertals, has been characterized for a century as having marked femoral curvature. To evaluate the degree of anterior femoral curvature in both Neandertals and other Late Pleistocene humans, their curvature subtenses and proximodistal positions were evaluated in the context of recent human variation. Recent human comparisons show little relationship between subtense (absolute curvature) and femoral length, suggesting that an index that incorporates subtense relative to the length of the femur is inappropriate for between-group assessments. Neandertals were statistically indistinguishable from Middle or earlier Upper Paleolithic modern humans in the degree of absolute curvature, all of whom had greater curvature on average than all later humans. Additionally, Neandertals and Qafzeh-Skhul early modern humans had a more distal point of maximum curvature than any other group. Curvature was not strongly correlated with functional considerations including body mass estimates, surrogate variables for body size, proximal femoral articular orientation, or knee anteroposterior dimensions. The functional role of femoral anterior curvature is unknown; however, the general decrease in curvature subtense closely parallels the between-group changes in inferred levels of mobility from femoral diaphyseal robusticity and shape, suggesting that femoral curvature may reflect mobility levels and patterns among Late Pleistocene and recent humans. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Curvature; Early modern humans; Femora; Mobility; Neandertals; Robusticity","article; biomechanics; body mass; body size; diaphysis; female; femur; human; knee; male; osteometry; physical anthropology; pleistocene; Continental Population Groups; Femur; Humans; Paleontology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036322044

The technique used in that study was subjective at best. He provided no substantial discrimination between whites or blacks. Two later studies only reused Stewart's technique and/or data. This study was assumed to address these issues and provide an improved technique. Skeletal collections at the Smithsonian, as well as the forensic collections at the University of Florida and the University of Tennessee, provided the specimens for this study. The historical collection of the First African Baptist Church of Philadelphia, PA, and the modern forensic collection at Louisiana State University provided the test samples. Only black and white individuals were used, and those were selected based on previous soft tissue or positive identification. Thirteen measurements were taken, including six newly developed measures. Age, race, and sex were also documented. Discriminant analysis was used to develop functions for race assessment. After analyzing the data through SPSSx using Discriminant, the variables selected provided an accuracy of 88.15% using the right femur and 86.10% with the left femur.

The technique is compared with traditional ways of measuring subtense and point of maximum curvature using either coordinate calipers or projection onto graph paper. Of the traditional methods the graph paper method is more reliable than using coordinate calipers. Measurement error is consistently lower for measuring point of maximum curvature than for measuring subtense. The results warrant caution when comparing data collected by the different traditional methods. Landmark data collection proves reliable and has a low measurement error. However, measurement error increases with the number of semi-landmarks included in the analysis of curvature. Measurements of subtense can be estimated more reliably using 3D landmarks along the curve than using traditional techniques. We use equidistant semi-landmarks to quantify the curve because sliding thesemi-landmarks masks the curvature signal. Principal components analysis of these equidistant semi-landmarks provides the added benefit of describing the shape of the curve. These results are promising for functional and forensic analysis of long bone curvature in modern human populations and in the fossil record.

However, it is necessary to compare these reflections of muscle moment arm length to appropriate measures of the body weight moment arm and body mass estimates, both of which are influenced by ecogeographically determined body proportions. Reassessment of tibial condylar displacement and patellar thickness, as well as patellar height, relative to an appropriate measure of the moment arm for the baseline load on the knee (body weight), to that moment arm times estimated body mass, and to that moment arm times a skeletal reflection of body mass (femoral head diameter) rejects the hypothesis that the Neandertals had exceptionally powerful knee extension. Relative tibial condylar displacement remains above that of a modern industrial society sample, but similar to that of the Broken Hill tibia, Late Pleistocene early modern humans and a recent human nonindustrial sample. Relative patellar thickness is similar to that of early modern humans, who have relatively thick patellae compared to the late Holocene human samples. Consequently, once body proportions are taken into account, there is little difference between the Neandertals and other later Pleistocene humans in knee extensor mechanical advantage, and all of these fossil hominids are similar in the more important proximal tibial proportions to those of nonindustrial recent humans.","Biomechanics; Early Modern humans; Human paleontology; Legs; Neandertals; Postcrania","biometry; functional morphology; Neanderthal; Acronicta leporina; Animalia; Hominidae; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033369193

The distinctiveness, inefficiency, or primitiveness of Neanderthal lifestyles and patterns of activity play a central role in many adaptive scenarios that have been proposed to explain the eventual ascendancy of modern humans and the Neanderthals' demise. However, many recent studies of faunal remains accumulated by Neanderthals, stable isotope analyses of Neanderthal bones, and the energetic demands of their large body mass suggest that these archaic humans were equally efficient hunters as fully modern foragers in similar environments. This contradictory evidence inspired the present study. To gain new insights into Neanderthal behaviors we use a comparative approach, examining indices of residual bone strength and midshaft diaphyseal shapes of the humerus, femur, and tibia in several groups of Neanderthals (European and Near Eastern), early modern humans, and sixteen diverse groups of recent humans. The results indicate that Neanderthal limbs bear a close similarity to a fairly wide spectrum of more recent groups, especially those who practiced intensive forms of foraging within fairly limited territories. The Neanderthal pattern differs strikingly from those of Skhul-Qafzeh and Gravettian humans, but these early modern humans also differ substantially from the later, intensive foragers. These results are probably more indicative of the relative distribution of people to resources in the Mousterian than the relative behavioral capacities of modern humans and Neanderthals. © 2008 Springer.","Cross-sectional geometry; Foraging; Habitual activity; Neanderthals",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045115343

Femora and humeri in six anthropoid genera of Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and gibbons were used. Bone length, curvature, and cross-sectional properties were incorporated into the analysis. These variables were obtained by a new method using three-dimensional morphological data reconstructed from consecutive CT images. This method revealed the patterns of curvature of anthropoid limb bones. Log-transformed scaling analyses of the characters revealed that bone length and especially bone curvature strongly reflected taxonomic/locomotor differences. As compared with Old World monkeys, New World monkeys and gibbons in particular have a proportionally long and less curved femur and humerus relative to body mass. It is also revealed that the section modulus relative to body mass varies less between taxonomic/locomotor groups in anthropoids. Calculation of theoretical bending strengths implied that Old World monkeys achieve near-constant bending strength in accordance with the tendency observed in general terrestrial mammals. Relatively shorter bone length and larger A-P curvature of Old World monkeys largely contribute to this uniformity. Bending strengths in New World monkeys and gibbons were, however, a little lower under lateral loading and extremely stronger and more variable under axial loading as compared with Old World monkeys, due to their relative elongated and weakly curved femora and humeri. These results suggest that arboreal locomotion, including quadrupedalism and suspension, requires functional demands quite dissimilar to those required in terrestrial quadrupedalism. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","3-D data processing; Arboreality; Beam theory; Bending strength; Gibbons; Long bone; New World monkeys; Old World monkeys; Scaling; Terrestriality","animal tissue; Anthropoidea; article; body mass; calculation; femur; geometry; humerus; land biome; leg lengthening; limb; locomotion; mammal; monkey; nonhuman; primate; taxonomy; Animals; Biomechanics; Body Weights and Measures; Femur; Haplorhini; Humerus; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17244367574
