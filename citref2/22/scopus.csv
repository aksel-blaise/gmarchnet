In the human cranium a number of anatomical traits are known to be sexual dimorphic. In this work, we present a geometric morphometric approach to automatically detect the most sexual dimorphic on skeletal collections. We applied the workflow on the human neurocranium and we defined, without an a priori definition of modules, which portions are most sexually dimorphic. We used a large sample of sex-known human 3D skulls to analyse the rate of sexual dimorphism found in the human neurocranium. We applied the Procrustes ANOVA on the best dimorphic patch found using the proposed workflow. We calculated the accuracy in discriminating sex in a sex-known sample by using our proposed model and the traditional approach. © 2019 International Conference on Metrology for Archaeology and Cultural Heritage.",,"Geometric morphometric; Local scale; Procrustes; Sexual dimorphism; Traditional approaches; History",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080038685
