At the nearby Bouri site several cut-marked bones also show stone tool use approximately 2.5-Myr ago. Here we report stone-tool-inflicted marks on bones found during recent survey work in Dikika, Ethiopia, a research area close to Gona and Bouri. On the basis of low-power microscopic and environmental scanning electron microscope observations, these bones show unambiguous stone-tool cut marks for flesh removal and percussion marks for marrow access. The bones derive from the Sidi Hakoma Member of the Hadar Formation. Established 40 Ar-39 Ar dates on the tuffs that bracket this member constrain the finds to between 3.42 and 3.24-Myr ago, and stratigraphic scaling between these units and other geological evidence indicate that they are older than 3.39-Myr ago. Our discovery extends by approximately 800,000 years the antiquity of stone tools and of stone-tool-assisted consumption of ungulates by hominins; furthermore, this behaviour can now be attributed to Australopithecus afarensis. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The experimental background applied to differentiate both types of marks has been rather limited and authors have sometimes reached conflicting conclusions. This is partly due to methodological reasons: some authors have used very high magnification to examine microscopic features, whereas others have relied on more reduced magnification. Likewise, some experiments have exposed bones to trampling for reduced periods (minutes) whereas others have used longer time periods (hours). The present study stresses that the use of a scanning electronic microscope is not practical for identifying the impact of butchery and trampling marks in complete bone assemblages. It also emphasizes that previous studies have not addressed all the possible variables that could potentially be used to discriminate these marks, nor have they quantified the morphological patterns of each type of mark. Here we present a multivariate analysis of more than a dozen variables and show that butchery and trampling marks have very distinctive microscopic morphology. We advocate the use of a low magnification approach (≤40×), which can enable the analysis of complete assemblages using either hand lenses or binocular lenses. We also show the morphological criteria that differentiate butchery cut marks made with simple and retouched tools. We show that whereas complete discrimination of marks is impossible due to some degree of overlap, the list of criteria derived through multivariate analyses can be confidently used to correctly differentiate butchery and trampling marks in more than 90% of cases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Butchering damage on the Dikika bones would imply that tool-assisted meat-eating began approximately 800,000 y before previously thought, based on butchered bones from 2.6- to 2.5-million-y-old sites at the Ethiopian Gona and Bouri localities. Further, the only hominin currently known from Dikika at approximately 3.4 Ma is Australopithecus afarensis, a temporally and geographically widespread species unassociated previously with any archaeological evidence of butchering. Our taphonomic configurational approach to assess the claims of A. afarensis butchery at Dikika suggests the claims of unexpectedly early butchering at the site are not warranted. The Dikika research group focused its analysis on the morphology of the marks in question but failed to demonstrate, through recovery of similarly marked in situ fossils, the exact provenience of the published fossils, and failed to note occurrences of random striae on the cortices of the published fossils (incurred through incidental movementof the defleshed specimens across and/or within their abrasive encasing sediments). The occurrence of such random striae (sometimes called collectively ""trampling"" damage) on the two fossils provide the configurational context for rejection of the claimed butchery marks. The earliest best evidence for hominin butchery thus remains at 2.6 to 2.5 Ma, presumably associated with more derived species than A. afarensis.","Abrasion; Cut marks; Equifinality; Hammerstone percussion; Taphonomy","article; carnivore; Ethiopia; fossil; hominid; human; morphology; paleoanthropology; priority journal; taphonomy; Animals; Biological Evolution; Bone and Bones; Feeding Behavior; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Tool Use Behavior; Australopithecus afarensis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650431002

However, the method by which we identify and interpret these marks remains largely unchanged despite decades of research, relying on qualitative criteria and lacking standardization between analysts. Recently, zooarchaeologists have begun using new technologies capable of capturing 3-D data from bone surface modifications to advance our knowledge of these informative traces. However, an important step in this research has been overlooked and after years of work, we lack both a universal and replicable protocol and an understanding of the precision of these techniques. Here we propose a new standard for identifying bone surface modifications using high-resolution 3-D data and offer a systematic and replicable approach for researchers to follow. Data were collected with a white-light non-contact confocal profilometer and analyzed with Digital Surf's Mountains® software. Our data show that when methods are standardized, results between researchers are statistically indistinguishable. Multivariate analyses using the measured parameters allow discrimination between stone tool cut marks and mammalian carnivore tooth marks with 97.5% accuracy. Application of this method to fossil specimens resulted in 100% correspondence with identifications made by an experienced analyst using macroscopic observations of qualitative features of bone surface modifications. High-resolution 3-D analyses of bone surface modifications have great potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of taphonomic research, but only if our methods are replicable and precise. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Confocal profilometry; Cut mark; Feeding trace; Tooth mark","archaeological evidence; bone; carnivore; fossil record; hominid; multivariate analysis; quantitative analysis; Stone Age; Mammalia; anatomy and histology; animal; archeology; bone; fossil; hominid; multivariate analysis; procedures; three dimensional imaging; tool use; Animals; Archaeology; Bone and Bones; Fossils; Hominidae; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Multivariate Analysis; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006943933

This partially reflects the lack of reliable ways to identify the taphonomic signatures of different large carnivore taxa. It is often unclear which carnivore taxon or taxa may have played a role in forming or modifying faunal assemblages found associated with stone tools, and this lack of clarity impacts reconstructions of hominin behavior. The mode, frequency and nutritional yield of carcasses acquired by hominins, and the extent to which hominin foraging impinged on or was constrained by the guild of large predators are topics of great importance. This paper characterizes the taphonomic signature of large felids using a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) image analysis method to study tooth marking and gross bone damage on neotaphonomic experiments carried out with tigers (Panthera tigris) and African lions (Panthera leo) at the Carolina Tiger Rescue (Pittsboro, North Carolina). This sample of over 400 bones significantly increases the size of current neotaphonomic samples modeling felid feeding traces, more than doubling the number of felid-modified specimens described in the literature. We identify a typical pattern of bone damage resulting from large felid carcass modification, which can be distinguished from bone damage patterns produced by hyaenids and canids. In summary, this pattern consists of tooth marking largely restricted to limb bone ends and minimal bone fragmentation. The frequency of tooth marking imparted by large felids in this study is lower than that produced by hyaenids, while canid tooth mark frequencies fall between the two. Investigation of the FLK Zinj assemblage from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, has documented several specimens with surface damage similar to our neotaphonomic sample. This may signal early access to carcasses through 'power scavenging' by hominins. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Flesh availability; FLK Zinj; Sabertooth; Scavenging; Taphonomy","bone; carnivore; felid; fossil assemblage; GIS; hominid; image analysis; Pleistocene; scavenging (feeding); taphonomy; tooth; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania; Canidae; Felidae; Hyaenidae; Panthera leo; Panthera tigris; animal; bone; carnivory; geographic information system; image processing; injuries; lion; tiger; Animals; Bone and Bones; Carnivory; Geographic Information Systems; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lions; Tigers",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923542393

These are generally associated with carnivore tooth-marks observed on large ungulate bones accumulated by humans. The occupation of sites by wolves is suspected to have modified archaeological assemblages to a greater extent than is generally admitted by archaeologists, to the point of invalidating certain behavioral interpretations. Four types of processes can be observed: 1) an accumulation of canid bones; 2) an accumulation of the remains of their prey; 3) an alteration of the spatial distribution of the remains of human activities; 4) a complete or partial consumption of the bone remains accumulated by humans. We can also add the stealing of bones, though this is more difficult to demonstrate. To address this question, naturalistic data were applied to the analysis of archaeological remains through a quantification of the destruction of sheep bones by wolves. In addition to information concerning the manner in which each type of bone was consumed, it was noted that a significant proportion the long bone fragments bear no traces of carnivore activity. Moreover, toothmark dimensions were shown to be less reliable for the distinction of wolf from fox than the size and specific morphology of their prey. In the case of mixed human and wolf activities, the presence of pelvic and pectoral bones with toothmarks, and long bone fragments of high length, are the most reliable evidence for quantifying the contribution of the latter.","Bone modifications; Canids; Consumption; Experimentation; Taphonomy","cave deposit; fossil assemblage; taphonomy; Canidae; Canis; Ovis aries; Ungulata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17744372867

The main objective was to test if variable identification could be made scientifically; that is, different researchers using the same method and criteria making the same assessment of each variable. This experiment shows that even in researchers trained in the same laboratories and following the same protocols divergences in the perception of each variable are significant. This indicates that mark perception and interpretation is a highly subjective process. If this basic analytical stage is subjective, subjectivity permeates to a greater degree the higher inferential stages leading from mark identification to reconstruction of butchering behaviors based on mark frequencies, mark anatomical distribution, actor-effector-trace processes, and statistical interpretations of the stochastic mark-imparting butchering processes. Here, we emphasize that the use of bone surface modifications for behavioral interpretations remains a non-scientific endeavor because of lack of independent replicability of criteria and processes, divergences in how variables are selected and used and epistemologically flawed analogs.

Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classification have been suggested. Different techniques, such as three-dimensional digital microscope (3D DM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) have been recently applied to the study of cut marks. Although the 3D DM and LSCM microscopic techniques are the most commonly used for the 3D identification of cut marks, M-PG has also proved to be very efficient and a low-cost method. M-PG is a noninvasive technique that allows the study of the cortical surface without any previous preparation of the samples, and that generates high-resolution models. Despite the current application of microscopic and micro-photogrammetric techniques to taphonomy, their reliability has never been tested. In this paper, we compare 3D DM, LSCM and M-PG in order to assess their resolution and results. In this study, we analyse 26 experimental cut marks generated with a metal knife. The quantitative and qualitative information registered is analysed by means of standard multivariate statistics and geometric morphometrics to assess the similarities and differences obtained with the different methodologies. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2017 Royal Microscopical Society","Experimental cut marks; laser scanning confocal microscopy; micro-photogrammetry; statistical agreement; three-dimensional digital microscope","analytic method; Article; biometry; bone; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; intermethod comparison; micro photogrammetry; morphometry; nonhuman; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; surface property; three dimensional digital microscopy; analysis of variance; confocal microscopy; devices; image processing; photogrammetry; procedures; reproducibility; standards; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Analysis of Variance; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Microscopy, Confocal; Models, Statistical; Photogrammetry; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018756590

However, such claims about Plio–Pleistocene hominids rely mostly on very small assemblages of bony remains. Furthermore, recent experiments on trampling animals and biting crocodiles have shown each to be capable of producing mimics of such marks. This equifinality—the creation of similar products by different processes—makes deciphering early archaeological bone assemblages difficult. Bone modifications among Ethiopian Plio–Pleistocene hominid and faunal remains at Asa Issie, Maka, Hadar, and Bouri were reassessed in light of these findings. The results show that crocodiles were important modifiers of these bone assemblages. The relative roles of hominids, mammalian carnivores, and crocodiles in the formation of Oldowan zooarchaeological assemblages will only be accurately revealed by better bounding equifinality. Critical analysis within a consilience-based approach is identified as the pathway forward. More experimental studies and increased archaeological fieldwork aimed at generating adequate samples are now required.","Cutmarks; Equifinality; Oldowan; Taphonomy; Zooarchaeology","archeology; Article; bone; carnivore; crocodile; Ethiopia; fauna; fossil animal; hominid; human; human tissue; mammal; nonhuman; Pleistocene; priority journal; taphonomy; tooth; Africa; anatomy and histology; animal; bites and stings; crocodilian; evolution; fossil; genetics; hominid; injuries; pathology; physiology; Africa; Alligators and Crocodiles; Animals; Biological Evolution; Bites and Stings; Bone and Bones; Fossils; Hominidae; Tooth",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038561763

Through this, we can generate studies that are able to diagnose the specific taphonomic agents and activities that produce said traces that can be found on osteological surfaces.

To further explore patterns of crocodylian bite mark expression, we conducted a survey of traces left by Alligator mississippiensis. We compared the results to pre-existing crocodylian datasets regarding the potentially diagnostic traits of bisected marks, hook scores, and a lack of furrows. Mark type did not correlate with vital statistics of the sampled animals or collections protocol. Bisected marks were found in rates similar to those seen in one previous survey of C. niloticus, and rates of hook scoring and bone breakage were higher. These traces were all present in higher rates than those reported in C. porosus. Unlike results seen in Crocodylus, furrows were identified in the A. mississippiensis samples. Hook scores were also identified, but recent surveys of non-crocodylian taxa have shown that these features are not unique to crocodylians and instead are related to inertial feeding strategies. The presence and rate of bisected marks found in this study bolster the interpretation that these traces are a clade-wide phenomenon and a useful diagnostic indicator for Crocodylia. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Crocodylia; Feeding trace; Tooth mark; Trophic interaction","crocodilian; feeding behavior; ichnology; trace fossil; trophic interaction",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901609364

However, modern bone damage data for most carnivore taxa are limited. This is particularly true for canids. This study presents bone damage data collected from feeding experiments conducted with Mexican Gray Wolves (Canis lupus baileyi) and Red Wolves (Canis rufus). This is the largest experimental assemblage reported for canids to date. The image-analysis GIS approach described by Marean et al. (2001) is expanded on here and used to document bone preservation and tooth mark distribution for the first time in a carnivore-modified bone assemblage. Further, we introduce the use of the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst to identify significant concentrations of bone modifications. Results show that the distribution of tooth pits varies considerably across elements as well as across different portions of the same element, and that significant clusters of tooth pits occur on all long bones. We suggest that with a large enough sample, the GIS Spatial Analyst can be a useful tool for analyzing the distribution of bone modifications with greater resolution than previous methods. This method facilitates comparisons between experimental and fossil assemblages which may aid in identifying the timing of access to carcasses by carnivores involved in modifying fossil assemblages. Finally, the use of this rigorous methodology is a step toward increasing standardization in methods of taphonomic analysis. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bone surface modification; Canids; Feeding experiments; Taphonomy","bone; canid; carnivore; fossil assemblage; GIS; taphonomy; taxonomy; tooth; Canidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944865442

Eighteen half-carcasses of red deer (Cervus elaphus) were processed using replicas of Middle Palaeolithic stone tools. The butchery complied with a strict protocol to allow the activity that produced each cutmark to be identified with confidence. The gestures of the butcher and every instance of contact between the tools and bones were also recorded. Each bone has been analyzed using a magnifying lens, and the cutmarks have been recorded on graphic templates of the bones. Comparison of our experimental data with the other available reference sets highlights several differences and important issues potentially leading to misinterpretation of butchering activities in archaeological contexts. In order to improve our ability to document butchering patterns, we introduce an updated, more complete and more detailed version of the cutmark coding system created by Binford (1981) and later supplemented by Nilssen (2000). The experiments conducted also allowed us to expand our understanding of some poorly documented activities, such as tendon-extraction and skinning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Butchery experiment; Carcass processing; Cutmarks; Subsistence; Ungulates; Zooarchaeology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010877275
