The classical maximurn likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AlC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples. © 1974, IEEE.

Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated.

This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent ""High Throughput"" methods achieve surprising success-they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms. © 2012 James Bergstra and Yoshua Bengio.","Deep learning; Global optimization; Model selection; Neural networks; Response surface modeling","Computation time; Computational budget; Configuration space; Data sets; Deep belief networks; Deep learning; Empirical evidence; Gaussian Processes; Grid search; Hierarchical model; High throughput; Hyper-parameter; Model selection; Optimization algorithms; Random searches; Response surface modeling; Algorithms; Bayesian networks; Global optimization; Hierarchical systems; Neural networks; Wave functions; Optimization",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857855190

It features over 25 performance measures that can be freely combined to create two-dimensional performance curves. Standard methods for investigating trade-offs between specific performance measures are available within a uniform framework, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs, precision/recall plots, lift charts and cost curves. ROCR integrates tightly with R's powerful graphics capabilities, thus allowing for highly adjustable plots. Being equipped with only three commands and reasonable default values for optional parameters, ROCR combines flexibility with ease of usage. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

A categorization of weathering characteristics into six stages, recognizable on descriptive criteria, provides a basis for investigation of weathering rates and processes. The time necessary to achieve each successive weathering stage has been calibrated using known-age carcasses. Most bones decompose beyond recognition in 10 to 15 yr. Bones of animals under 100 kg and juveniles appear to weather more rapidly than bones of large animals or adults. Small-scale rather than widespread environmental factors seem to have greatest influence on weathering characteristics and rates.

For interpolation of a surface over a fixed set of nodes in the plane, the bending energy is a quadratic form in the heights assigned to the surface. The spline is the superposition of eigenvectors of the bending energy matrix, of successively larger physical scales, over a tilted flat plane having no bending energy at all. When these splines are paired, one representing the x-coordinate of another form and the other the y-coordinate, they aid greatly in the modeling of biological shape change as deformation. In this context, the pair becomes an interpolation map from R2 to R2 relating two sets of landmark points. The spline maps decompose, in the same way as the spline surfaces, into a linear part (an affine transformation) together with the superposition of principal warps, which are geometrically independent, affine-free deformations of progressively smaller geometrical scales. The warps decompose an empirical deformation into orthogonal features more or less as a conventional orthogonal functional analysis decomposes the single scene. This paper demonstrates the decomposition of deformations by principal warps, extends the method to deal with curving edges between landmarks, relates this formalism to other applications of splines current in computer vision, and indicates how they might aid in the extraction of features for analysis, comparison, and diagnosis of biological and medical images. © 1989 IEEE","Affine transformations; biharmonic equation; biomedical image analysis; deformation; principal warps; quadratic variation; shape; thin-plate splines; warping",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957563017

The experimental background applied to differentiate both types of marks has been rather limited and authors have sometimes reached conflicting conclusions. This is partly due to methodological reasons: some authors have used very high magnification to examine microscopic features, whereas others have relied on more reduced magnification. Likewise, some experiments have exposed bones to trampling for reduced periods (minutes) whereas others have used longer time periods (hours). The present study stresses that the use of a scanning electronic microscope is not practical for identifying the impact of butchery and trampling marks in complete bone assemblages. It also emphasizes that previous studies have not addressed all the possible variables that could potentially be used to discriminate these marks, nor have they quantified the morphological patterns of each type of mark. Here we present a multivariate analysis of more than a dozen variables and show that butchery and trampling marks have very distinctive microscopic morphology. We advocate the use of a low magnification approach (≤40×), which can enable the analysis of complete assemblages using either hand lenses or binocular lenses. We also show the morphological criteria that differentiate butchery cut marks made with simple and retouched tools. We show that whereas complete discrimination of marks is impossible due to some degree of overlap, the list of criteria derived through multivariate analyses can be confidently used to correctly differentiate butchery and trampling marks in more than 90% of cases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, they hold some of the oldest available information on cognitive ability and behaviour in human evolution. Here we present a new method that allows a three-dimensional reconstruction of cutmark morphology and the quantification of profile parameters. We have tested this new technique on cutmarks that were experimentally inflicted on a pig rib using a steel knife and an un-retouched flint flake at different angles. The method allows for the cross-sectional shape, the sharpness and depths of the resulting cutmarks to be quantified. The data show that knife mark sections are characterised by a V-shape or √-shape depending on the inclination of the knife. Cutmarks produced with the flint flake were less clearly defined and generally less sharp than those produced by the knife. We discuss the method's potential to provide new information on butchery technique and cognitive abilities developed by the human lineage, from the earliest tool-using hominins through to modern Homo sapiens. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These transformations include changes in artifact distributions and formal alterations that should be taken into account when carrying out studies of activity areas. The experiments were made on dry, hard-packed surfaces and in the same sediments after a rain. The materials used were bones, obsidian flakes, sherds, and fragments of brick and wood. The analysis focuses on vertical displacement, horizontal displacement, and damage (breakage, microflaking, and abrasion), paying special attention to the response of the trodden substrate and its implications for the whole process. The interaction of trampling with other formation processes (e.g., maintenance) also is considered. The main patterns observed in the trampled materials are vertical and horizontal size sorting, and characteristic size distributions in sherds. These empirical generalizations are then integrated in a model that can help to identify trampled contexts and assess their potential for behavioral inference. © 1991 The Society for American Archaeology.",,,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000846219

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of bone surface replicas distinguishes among hominid-produced cutmarks, carnivore tooth scratches, and other types of bone damage. A sample of 102 replicas, comprising the most likely cutmarks on a combined sample of roughly 3000 fossils from Torralba and Ambrona, were scanned to determine the major agent of damage. Microscopically verified cutmarks are present, but rare, occurring in less than 1% of the bones in the combined sample. Carnivore tooth scratches are comparably rare. In contrast, evidence of sedimentary abrasion, which obliterates the diagnostic features of cutmarks, is present on nearly every bone from Torralba and Ambrona. It remains unresolved whether cutmarks were initially more common on these bones and were subsequently obliterated by abrasion, or whether the incidence of cutmarks was always low. These data demonstrate clearly that hominids and carnivores each damaged some bones at Torralba and Ambrona, but the frequency of each type of mark is too low to confirm strongly the interpretation of these sites as either butchery or carnivore remains. © 1983.","acheulian; ambrona; butchery; cutmarks; sem; Torralba","Acheulian.; Ambrona; Butchery; Cutmarks; SEM; Torralba",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021059958

The study empirically shows that small and large carnivores can be clearly differentiated when using tooth pit size, with a higher discrimination when using tooth marks on dense shafts than on cancellous ends.

This article presents an innovative methodology which supplements the microscopic study of cut marks. Despite the benefits of using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the two-dimensional identification of these marks, it has a number of drawbacks such as the high costs and, consequently, the limited sample studied. In this article, a low-cost technique for the analysis of cut mark micromorphology from a tri-dimensional perspective is introduced. It provides a high-resolution approach to cut mark characterisation such as morphology, depth, width, and angle estimation as well as section determination, measured directly on the marks on bones.

These alterations consist of small notches located on the oblique fracture angles of some bones. The frequency at which these modifications appear in the assemblage has obliged to plan several experimental series to know the process that causes them. To be more exact, this study aims to verify whether these small chips are the result of trampling. For this purpose, two experimental series have been developed. The first of which has the objective of differentiating between the variables related to the original state of the bone (green, semi-dry and dry) and the second is aimed at reproducing the modifications observed in the archaeological set, taking into account the data obtained in the previous series. Following these experiments, the appearance of small notches is observed on the oblique fracture angles of some bones in semi-dry state. These resulting chips are similar to those documented in Bolomor Cave, Level XII. Therefore, it is deduced that trampling is the principle cause of these modifications in the bone record. This fact has important archaeological implications, as the spatial distribution of this modification can provide information about the intrasite movements of the human groups. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Our work, as in other studies, aims to identify the origin of different kinds of marks on bones. In this paper, we test the application of a HIROX Digital Microscope KH-7700. This microscope captures 3D images of the bone surface, thus bringing into focus the whole section of striations. This enables the direct observation of their shape from several points of view and the relatively rapid procurement of a variety of measurements (e.g. depth, breadth, angles). This technology has been applied to several butchery experiments, in which both stone and metal tools have been used to produce cut marks on skeletal elements. The morphometrical parameters presented in this paper enabled the correct identification of the different origins of experimental striations and were further tested on two archaeological sets of cut marks inflicted by both metal blades and flint flakes or tools. Therefore, the obtained experimental records constitute a useful database for archaeological remains. The morphometrical parameters developed and implemented in this study represent objective criteria for identifying the origin of cut marks which can be processed through statistical analysis. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","3D-images; Cut marks cross-sections; Digital microscope; Morphometrical parameters; Stone vs. metal tools; Taphonomy",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867331436

However, the method by which we identify and interpret these marks remains largely unchanged despite decades of research, relying on qualitative criteria and lacking standardization between analysts. Recently, zooarchaeologists have begun using new technologies capable of capturing 3-D data from bone surface modifications to advance our knowledge of these informative traces. However, an important step in this research has been overlooked and after years of work, we lack both a universal and replicable protocol and an understanding of the precision of these techniques. Here we propose a new standard for identifying bone surface modifications using high-resolution 3-D data and offer a systematic and replicable approach for researchers to follow. Data were collected with a white-light non-contact confocal profilometer and analyzed with Digital Surf's Mountains® software. Our data show that when methods are standardized, results between researchers are statistically indistinguishable. Multivariate analyses using the measured parameters allow discrimination between stone tool cut marks and mammalian carnivore tooth marks with 97.5% accuracy. Application of this method to fossil specimens resulted in 100% correspondence with identifications made by an experienced analyst using macroscopic observations of qualitative features of bone surface modifications. High-resolution 3-D analyses of bone surface modifications have great potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of taphonomic research, but only if our methods are replicable and precise. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Confocal profilometry; Cut mark; Feeding trace; Tooth mark","archaeological evidence; bone; carnivore; fossil record; hominid; multivariate analysis; quantitative analysis; Stone Age; Mammalia; anatomy and histology; animal; archeology; bone; fossil; hominid; multivariate analysis; procedures; three dimensional imaging; tool use; Animals; Archaeology; Bone and Bones; Fossils; Hominidae; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Multivariate Analysis; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006943933

The overlap of their ecological niches has raised an important debate on the role that carnivores played in archaeological site formation. Different analytical techniques differentiate the action of carnivores and humans and identify the type of carnivore involved of which tooth mark analyses are prominent. However, available taphonomic studies present some limitations given the great overlap among tooth mark sizes from different carnivores, enabling only the distinction of size groups, not specific carnivores. In this work, we use a new technique combining three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and geometric morphometrics (GMM) of tooth pits on equid and bovid bone created by different carnivores (including crocodiles, hyenas, jaguars, lions and wolves) in controlled settings. The 3D methodology we present isolates and differentiates tooth marks generated by different carnivores. We also test the applicability of the technique to ascribe tooth pits recorded on some hominin specimens from FLK Zinj and FLKNN 3 (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). The tooth marks on the Olduvai OH8 and OH35 hominin fossils, previously assigned to crocodiles show that while OH8 tooth pit morphology falls in the range created by crocodiles, the pits on OH35 can not be interpreted as crocodile-inflicted marks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Geometric morphometrics; Homo habilis; Micro-photogrammetry; Taphonomy; Tooth marks","archaeology; bone; carnivore; crocodilian; feeding behavior; fossil record; geometry; hominid; morphometry; Olduvai event; photogrammetry; reconstruction; taphonomy; three-dimensional modeling; tooth; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania; Bovidae; Canidae; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Equidae; Homo habilis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019375211

Much experimental work has been done to understand the causal agents behind some bone surface modifications, but recent controversies show that there is still no consensus. Terminology is not consistent between researchers, and there is ambiguity in how characteristics of marks are described and interpreted. There is also a lack of understanding of what causes individual variables within marks made by different agents, which is compounded by mark morphologies being described in terms that imply their causality. This paper examines these two problems in light of historic and current trends in the taphonomic literature, and recommends ways to describe marks that will facilitate more effective communication between researchers. It is proposed that greater standardisation within zooarchaeology is needed in seven key areas, and that this is the best avenue for moving into a new phase of taphonomic research. © Association for Environmental Archaeology 2015.","Bone surface modifications; Experimental; Standardisation; Taphonomy; Terminology; Zooarchaeology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940447115

Several researchers suggest that the main element to be considered is the skeletal representation of the different species identified in the faunal assemblage. This element must be associated to the animals' age at death and the localisation of processing marks of the carcasses (both those of anthropic origin and those produced by carnivores). Occasionally, these marks coincide on the same point of the bone, giving cause for overlapping marks. These marks can be considered an aid more to identify the anthropic manner for obtaining animal recourses. However, these cases are very unusual at archaeological sites, and it is not always easy to identify which of the two predators has obtained the prey first. Through the experimental process presented in this article, we have observed diagnostic elements on overlapping marks that show the action sequence of the predators (hominids and carnivores) on carcasses. These experimental criteria were applied to different archaeological sites of the Lower and Middle Pleistocene in the Iberian Peninsula: Bolomor Cave (Valencia, Spain) and level TD10-1 and TD6-2 of Gran Dolina (Atapuerca, Burgos). In these assemblages, we were able to distinguish hunting and scavenging events through overlapping marks, providing a new element to the general interpretation of these sites. © 2009 Académie des sciences.","Bolomor Cave; Experimental process; Faunal record; Gran Dolina; Lower Pleistocene; Middle Pleistocene; Overlapping marks; Spain; Subsistence strategies","Caves; Bolomor Cave; Experimental process; Faunal record; Gran Dolina; Lower Pleistocene; Middle Pleistocene; Overlapping marks; Spain; Subsistence strategies; Animals; archaeology; carnivore; hominid; hunting; Pleistocene; predator; skeletal remains; Eurasia; Europe; Iberian Peninsula; Southern Europe; Animalia; Hominidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-68549116971

The main objective was to test if variable identification could be made scientifically; that is, different researchers using the same method and criteria making the same assessment of each variable. This experiment shows that even in researchers trained in the same laboratories and following the same protocols divergences in the perception of each variable are significant. This indicates that mark perception and interpretation is a highly subjective process. If this basic analytical stage is subjective, subjectivity permeates to a greater degree the higher inferential stages leading from mark identification to reconstruction of butchering behaviors based on mark frequencies, mark anatomical distribution, actor-effector-trace processes, and statistical interpretations of the stochastic mark-imparting butchering processes. Here, we emphasize that the use of bone surface modifications for behavioral interpretations remains a non-scientific endeavor because of lack of independent replicability of criteria and processes, divergences in how variables are selected and used and epistemologically flawed analogs. This constitutes a major call to taphonomy to engage in more scientific (i.e., objective) approaches to the study of bone surface modifications for taphonomic inference elaboration. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Analogy; Bone surface modifications; Cut marks; Microscopy; Taphonomy","archaeology; bone; experimental study; identification method; microscopy; stochasticity; taphonomy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031126750

These studies have brought to light, with relative precision, the features that identify and differentiate the two types of modifications. However, few studies differentiate these modifications after they have been affected by other factors. Chemical alteration, related to lixiviated sediments, is documented in a relatively high number of archaeological sites. Following the criteria established by Domínguez-Rodrigo etal. (2009), the aim of this paper is to know if diagnostic criteria that would allow modifications resulting from trampling to be differentiated from cut mark modifications are preserved, after undergoing chemical alterations. The results have been applied to unidentified marks located on faunal skeletal remains from the La Mina site, at the Barranc de la Boella (Tarragona, Spain), the surfaces of which have been heavily modified by the lixiviation of the sediments. The data suggest that chemically altered marks lose the diagnostic criteria necessary for correct identification. The unidentified marks discovered on remains from la Boella could not be verified as cut or trampling marks and therefore cannot be considered in future zooarchaeological and taphonomical studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Barranc de la Boella; Chemical alteration; Cut marks; La Mina; Trampling","archaeological evidence; chemical alteration; sediment; skeletal remains; trampling; archaeology; experimental study; identification method; Catalonia; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904541163

Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classification have been suggested. Different techniques, such as three-dimensional digital microscope (3D DM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) have been recently applied to the study of cut marks. Although the 3D DM and LSCM microscopic techniques are the most commonly used for the 3D identification of cut marks, M-PG has also proved to be very efficient and a low-cost method. M-PG is a noninvasive technique that allows the study of the cortical surface without any previous preparation of the samples, and that generates high-resolution models. Despite the current application of microscopic and micro-photogrammetric techniques to taphonomy, their reliability has never been tested. In this paper, we compare 3D DM, LSCM and M-PG in order to assess their resolution and results. In this study, we analyse 26 experimental cut marks generated with a metal knife.

One of them is related to the action of carnivores, which is reflected in conspicuous tooth marks, such as pits, scores, punctures or furrowing. Different carnivores damage bone assemblages differently. Thus, several researches have tried to identify carnivore agency based on different parameters such as skeletal profiles, tooth mark frequencies and dimensions, breakage patterns, or more recently, taphotypes. Here we propose a new methodology based on the analysis of tooth scores to determine the carnivore type involved in bone modification. For this purpose, we have built 3D models of several tooth scores produced by wolves, lions, jaguars, foxes and hyenas using photogrammetric techniques. These models were later analyzed by means of Geometric Morphometrics and multivariate statistics. We show that although there is a high degree of overlap in tooth mark morphology, the combined action of tooth score dimensions and morphology enables the identification of some of the tooth scores made by lions from those of the other carnivores with a higher degree of confidence than any other inter-carnivore comparison. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer vision; Image-based modelling; Micro-Photogrammetry; Scores; Taphonomy of carnivores; Tooth marks",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019725876

It is often assumed that this change is associated with dietary expansion to incorporate large mammal resources. Although other aspects of the hominin diet, such as aquatic or vegetal resources, are assumed to be a part of hominin subsistence, identifying evidence of these adaptations has proved difficult. Here we present a series of analyses that provide methodological support for the inclusion of aquatic resources in hominin dietary reconstructions. We suggest that bone surface modifications in aquatic species are morphologically distinguishable from bone surface modifications on terrestrial taxa. We relate these findings to differences that we document in the surface mechanical properties of the two types of bone, as reflected by significant differences in bone surface microhardness values between aquatic and terrestrial species. We hypothesize that the characteristics of bone surface modifications on aquatic taxa inhibit the ability of zooarchaeologists to consistently diagnose them correctly. Contingently, this difficulty influences correspondence levels between zooarchaeologists, and may therefore result in misinterpretation of the taphonomic history of early Pleistocene aquatic faunal assemblages. A blind test using aquatic specimens and a select group of 9 experienced zooarchaeologists as participants was designed to test this hypothesis. Investigation of 4 different possible explanations for blind test results suggest the dominant factors explaining patterning relate to (1) the specific methodologies employed to diagnose modifications on aquatic specimens and (2) the relative experience of participants with modifications on aquatic bone surfaces. Consequently we argue that an important component of early hominin diets may have hitherto been overlooked as a result of (a) the paucity of referential frameworks within which to identify such a component and (b) the inability of applied identification methodologies to consistently do so. © 2013 Archer, Braun.",,"aquatic fauna; aquatic species; archeology; article; bone characteristics and functions; bone examination; bone structure; bone surface microhardness; dietary intake; evolutionary adaptation; fossil hominin; Pleistocene; resource management; species difference; terrestrial species; zoology; Animals; Bone and Bones; Catfishes; Cichlids; Diet; Food Handling; Hominidae; Kenya; Paleontology; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882617036

Over the last several decades, however, BSM identification has remained contentious, particularly in terms of identifying the earliest instances of hominin butchery; there has been a lack of consensus over how to identify or differentiate marks made by human and non-human actors and varying effectors. Most investigations have relied on morphology to identify butchery marks and their patterning. This includes cut marks, one of the most significant human marks. Attempts to discriminate cut marks from other types of marks have employed a variety of techniques, ranging from subjectively characterizing cut mark morphology using the naked eye, to using high-powered microscopy such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or micro-photogrammetry. More recent approaches use 3D datasets to obtain even more detailed information about mark attributes, and apply those to the fossil record. Although 3D datasets open promising new avenues for investigation, analyses of these datasets have not yet taken advantage of the full 3D surface morphology of BSM. Rather, selected cross-sectional slices of 3D scans have been used as proxies for overall shape. Here we demonstrate that 3D geometric morphometrics (GM), under the “Procrustes paradigm” and coupled with a Bayesian approach, probabilistically discriminates between marks caused by different butchery behaviors. At the same time, this approach provides a complete set of 3D morphological measurements and descriptions. Our results strengthen statistical confidence in cut mark identification and offer a novel approach that can be used to discriminate subtle differences between cut mark types in the fossil record. Furthermore, this study provides an incipient digital library with which to make future quantitative comparisons to archaeological examples, including contentious specimens that are key to understanding the earliest hominin butchery. © 2017 The Authors","Butchery; Cut marks; Multivariate methods; Shape; Taphonomy","Bayesian analysis; bone; geometry; human evolution; morphometry; multivariate analysis; shape; taphonomy; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044392529

Studies of these sharp-edged stone tools show that they were most probably used as cutting implements. However, the only substantial evidence of this is the presence of cut marks on the bones of animals found in association with stone tools in ancient deposits. Numerous studies have aimed to quantify the frequency and placement of these marks. At present there is little consensus on the meaning of these marks and how the frequency relates to specific behaviours in the past. Here we investigate the possibility that mechanical properties associated with edges of stone tools as well as the properties of bones themselves may contribute to the overall morphology of these marks and ultimately their placement in the archaeological record. Standardized tests of rock mechanics (Young’s modulus and Vickers hardness) indicate that the hardness of tool edges significantly affects cut-mark morphology. In addition, we show that indentation hardness of bones also impacts the overall morphology of cut marks. Our results show that rock type and bone portions influence the shape and prevalence of cut marks on animal bones. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Cut-marks on red deer (Cervus elaphus) long bones defleshed using different lithic implements during experimental butchery of whole carcasses were analysed using low magnification microscopy. Following existing studies (i.e. Domínguez-Rodrigo et al., 2009; de Juana et al., 2010), sixteen variables were recorded and the resulting dataset was statistically tested for significant differences between tool types. The same microscopic analysis was then applied to an archaeological sample of red deer long bone fragments from the Middle Palaeolithic site of Noisetier Cave. While this approach is relatively costless, allows for the analysis of large bone samples and is easily reproducible by different analysts, our results show that microscopic differences between cut-marks produced by simple flakes and those made by tools are not statistically significant and that important overlap exists between the cut-marks produced by the three types of tools. The application of the experimental results to the archaeological sample thus proved difficult. This study underlines the need for a cautious use of this type of method when analysing archaeological material. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cut-marks; Experimental butchery; Mousterian tools; Multivariate analysis; Noisetier cave",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84998886213

In some cases, classification may reach an accuracy of 100%. No other statistical tool commonly used in taphonomy had been this successful at classification before. However, the heuristics of ML algorithms depend tightly on the objectivity in raw data collection. The use of multivariate approaches in which variables are independently scored by the analyst introduces a subjective bias. In this work, I show that different analysts producing raw data on the same testing data set can lead to widely divergent BSM classifications and interpretations using the same powerful ML algorithms. It is emphasized that until an objective non-biasing method of raw data collection is implemented, BSM classification carried out via statistical tests will remain heuristically limited. As a consequence, the application of these referents to archeological BSM does not guarantee a correct interpretation beyond the analyst expertise. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Algorithm; Bone surface modification; Cut marks; Machine learning; Taphonomy; Trampling marks",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053340004

The aim of this study was to assess and compare the quality, evaluated in terms of hardness of packages of lamellae, of cortical and trabecular bones, at different anatomical sites within the human skeleton. The contralateral six long bones of an old human subject were indented at different levels along the diaphysis and at both epiphyses of each bone. Hardness value, which is correlated to the degree of mineralisation, of both cortical and trabecular bone tissues was calculated for each indentation location. It was found that the cortical bone tissue was harder (+18%) than the trabecular one. In general, the bone hardness was found to be locally highly heterogeneous. In fact, considering one single slice obtained for a bone segment, the coefficient of variation of the hardness values was up to 12% for cortical bone and up to 17% for trabecular bone. However, the tissue hardness was on average quite homogeneous within and among the long bones of the studied donor, although differences up to 9% among levels and up to 7% among bone segments were found. These findings seem not to support the mentioned hypothesis, at least not for the long bones of an old subject. © IMechE 2012.","Anatomical sites; Cortical bone; Hardness; Microindentation; Tissue quality; Trabecular bone","Anatomical sites; Cortical bone; Micro indentation; Tissue quality; Trabecular bones; Hardness; Tissue; Bone; aged; article; biological model; bone; bone mineralization; female; hardness; histology; human; physiology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Aged; Bone and Bones; Calcification, Physiologic; Female; Hardness; Humans; Models, Biological; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877104288

Here, trampling experiments were conducted to investigate these effects and to describe the types of surface modification that could occur on bone in coastal sediment. The results suggest that bone is significantly more likely to exhibit surface modification if trampled in shelly rather than sandy sediment. Burnt bone is less likely to display trampling modification. This is probably because, prior to trampling, burning exfoliates the cortex making the observation of markings on bone problematic. Pitting, trampling lines and sheen were found to be the most prevalent form of surface modification. Pitting is a particularly over-looked criterion and its presence on archaeological bone suggests that the effects of trampling should be considered in zooarchaeological analyses. The pervasiveness of sheen and trampling lines on the experimental bone makes it possible that some incidence of trampling could be mistaken for use-wear or intentional polish. However, the vast majority of trampled bone exhibits sheen which does not resemble anthropogenic specimens and trampling is unlikely to smooth bone fragment edges. This experiment demonstrates that modification caused by trampling can generally be differentiated from butchery markings. The high percentage of modified trampled bone in the shelly deposits suggests that some shell-marks may be mistaken for cut marks, if recovered in an archaeological context. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeology; bone; coastal sediment; experimental study; shell; trampling",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898808946

This debate, commonly known as the hunter-scavenger debate, fostered the emergence of a new research line into the Bone Surface Modifications (BSMs) produced by both taphonomic agents. Throughout the following 20 years, multiple studies concerning the action of carnivores have been developed, with a particular focus on the oldest archaeological sites in East Africa. Recent technological advances applied to taphonomy have provided new insight into carnivore BSMs. A newly developed part of this work relies on Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) studies aimed at discerning carnivore agency through the morphologic characterization of tooth scores and pits.

Although the process is well known, little experimental research has focused on describing the effects this process has on bone surface modifications (BSM), which can subsequently be applied to the fossil record. Water currents may have played an important role in altering the surfaces of bones from Barranc de la Boella, which were deposited in a deltaic fan context. Striae of undetermined origin have been documented on bones at the la Mina locality, and possible cut marks found on bones at Pit 1 locality. In our experiments, both fresh and dry bones with reproduced trampling striae and cut marks were tumbled in a tumbling machine, combining different types of movement and proportions of water to sediment. The bones were examined after each of the five cycles of the modification process, which lasted 30′, 30′, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h. Our results show a considerable diminishing of trampling striae, while the majority of cut marks were preserved. The marks on fresh bones were more severely altered than those on dry bones. Based on the results of this experiment, the marks from Pit 1 appear to be morphologically close to the experimentally altered cut marks, while the majority of those from la Mina are more similar to the altered trampling striae. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cut marks; Late early pleistocene; Sequential experiments; Taphonomy; Trampling","archaeological evidence; archaeology; bone; experimental study; morphology; Pleistocene; taphonomy; trampling; Catalonia; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059224875

Recent research has focused on quantifying the micromorphology of experimentally created cut and tooth marks using high-resolution 3-D scanning technology with the goal of improving the reliability and accuracy of interpretations that are based on these feeding traces. However, to apply these experimental data in the identification and interpretation of bone surface modifications on fossil bones, the effect of post-depositional processes on the micromorphology of feeding traces must be known. Previous research has shown that fluvial abrasion has a substantial impact on the qualitative criteria that are used to identify cut marks, but the specific effect of hydraulic transport and abrasion on quantifiable attributes of bone surface modifications is completely unknown. The objective of this research is to understand the effects of fluvial abrasion on the micromorphology of cut marks and mammalian carnivore tooth marks using high-resolution 3-D data. An experimental study was undertaken by tumbling cattle and deer bones in a rock tumbler filled with sand and water to simulate the effects of fluvial abrasion on the bone surface modifications. Variables were measured using qualitative (visual observation of rounding and polishing of the bone surfaces, and the effect of these processes on the potential identifiability of cut and tooth marks) and quantitative (surface area, volume, maximum depth, mean depth, maximum length, maximum width, roughness, angle, and radius of the marks) criteria. The 3-D data from cut and tooth marks was collected using a white-light confocal profilometer and analyzed with specialized surface metrology software. Analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data indicate that fluvial abrasion has a greater effect on cut marks than tooth marks, suggesting that the frequency of cut marks could be underestimated relative to carnivore tooth marks in archaeological assemblages preserved in fluvial environments. This could affect interpretations of hominin feeding behavior based on the abundance of bone surface modifications when relying on qualitative methods alone. However, 98.6% of marks were identified correctly after tumbling when using multivariate quantitative methods of analysis bolstering the need for applying these methods in the interpretation of bone surface modifications on fossil specimens. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Confocal profilometry; Cut mark; Feeding trace; Fluvial abrasion; Tooth mark",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050104181

Box 52379, Saxonwold, Johannesburg, 2132, South Africa","The scientific replicability crisis has recently focused on bone surface modification (BSM) analysis, which underlies zooarchaeological and anthropological conclusions about the ecology and evolution of tool-assisted carcass consumption behavior. We review a recent blind test of inter-analyst correspondence in morphometric analysis of experimentally generated butchery marks that advocates algorithmic methods for diagnosing and measuring BSM in an effort to standardize methodology and minimize inter-analyst error (Domínguez-Rodrigo et al., 2017. Use and abuse of cut mark analyses: The Rorschach effect. Journal of Archaeological Science, 86, 14–23. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2017.08.001). This study overstates concern about the inaccuracy of BSM measurement and interpretation, concluding that BSM analysis is a subjective, non-scientific endeavor. Based on a minimally described sample of cut marks, it measures variables that involve inherent inaccuracy and subjectivity and overlooks how the contexts of experimental sample generation – particularly the difference between immanent and configurational processes – differentially affect cut mark morphometrics. We illustrate this discussion with experimental taphonomic examples focused on analytical context including sample construction and control over factors that affect cut mark cross-sectional size. Our analysis suggests the relationship between tool attributes and cut mark morphology is not generalizable to all experimental and archaeological butchery contexts. We show that our experimental samples capture metric variability observed in archaeological cut marks, but that intentionally incised marks and realistic defleshing marks differ in width and depth. Further, when controlling for factors that impact cut mark size including animal size class, tool type, butcher experience, and density across bone portions, overlapping cut mark widths and depths produced by phonolite and ignimbrite flakes lead to poor classification of marks according to causal flake material, which casts doubt on the ability to discriminate cut marks made by different materials. We build datasets that include diverse experimental contexts and suggest that meta-analysis can disentangle how multiple configurational factors contribute to cut mark morphometric attributes. Ultimately, progress in BSM analysis rests on inter-analyst replicability, which must be preceded by clear discussion of all parts of the inferential loop – from the design of experiments that generate actualistic analogues, to their use in supporting archaeological arguments. Otherwise, problematic expert knowledge traditions may mask arguments from authority in sophisticated methodological language and under-reported experimental context. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Butchery; Context; Cut marks; Experimental taphonomy; Expert knowledge; Generality; Realism","algorithm; anthropology; archaeology; bone; knowledge; morphometry; taphonomy; Animalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050073125

Many authors have indicated differences to exist between the cut marks produced by different tools and when the same types of tool have been made from different raw materials. The present work examines the cut marks made during the experimental butchering of a red deer (Cervus elaphus) using simple quartz flakes, with those found on fossilised animal remains at the Navalmaíllo Rock Shelter site (Pinilla del Valle, Madrid, Spain) likely to have been made with similar flakes. The methodology followed was that of Domínguez-Rodrigo et al. (2009), which was originally designed to differentiate between cut marks and trampling marks, but which here was tested as a method of distinguishing between the raw materials from which cutting tools were made. The results were also compared to those made with other types of tool/raw material reported in the literature. The present results confirm the above ideas: the marks made experimentally by the quartz flakes are very similar to those seen on the faunal remains from the level F of Navalmaíllo Rock Shelter site, but different to those made by other tools or by flakes made from other materials. They also show, however, that different cut mark morphologies are largely independent of the size of the animal butchered, and of the anatomical element on which they appear. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Cut marks; Middle Palaeolithic; Navalmaíllo rock shelter; Quartz flakes; Taphonomy","archaeology; deer; experimental study; fossil; Paleolithic; quartz; shelter; taphonomy; tool use; Madrid [Spain]; Spain; Animalia; Cervus elaphus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054037329

These traces are direct indications of human activity and by studying how and why they were made, we can begin to understand a variety of past human behaviours. Consequently, over the last ten years we have observed an increase in the development of new analytical techniques to better understand the production, function, macro-, and micro-morphometric characteristics of bone modifications. In this study we present the application of multiple techniques to visualise and analyse the internal and external features of modified bone, teeth and antler. A Focus Variation Microscope (FVM), the Alicona InfiniteFocus optical surface measurement system, was used to examine the topography of surface modifications. This system produces 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, allowing evaluations of metric parameters (depth, width, area and volume) associated with different type of modifications. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), operated in variable pressure mode, was used to capture higher resolution images for better characterisation and identification of the modifications and finer details, which are not always visible using a FVM. The extension of an SEM with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy allowed for elemental analyses of the modified surfaces, including the recognition of exogenous elements imbedded within the modifications. Finally, micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) was performed to record how extensively a modification can affect and alter the internal structure of organic specimens. Analyses of μCT data also help to visualise gross surface morphology when obscured by other material. Together these approaches provide in-depth assessments of bone taphonomy on both the inside and the outside, furthering our understandings of ancient human behaviours. © 2019","Bone tools; Cut marks; Gough's cave; Human tooth-marks; Knapping damage; Perforated batons","bone; fossil assemblage; hominid; scanning electron microscopy; taphonomy; tomography; tooth; Goughs Cave",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062476811

This has possible forensic applications, notably for determining the postmortem interval. Experimental porcine bone samples were decomposed in surface and burial deposition scenarios over a period of 6 months. Although the Vickers hardness varied widely, it was found that when transverse axial hardness was subtracted from longitudinal axial hardness, the difference showed correlations with three distinct phases of soft tissue putrefaction. The ratio of transverse axial hardness to longitudinal axial hardness showed a similar correlation. A difference of 10 or greater in HV with soft tissue present and signs of minimal decomposition, was associated with a decomposition period of 250 cumulative cooling degree days or less. A difference of 10 (+/- standard error of mean at a 95% confidence interval) or greater in HV associated with marked decomposition indicated a decomposition period of 1450 cumulative cooling degree days or more. A difference of −7 to +8 (+/- standard error of mean at a 95% confidence interval) was thus associated with 250 to 1450 cumulative cooling degree days’ decomposition.

Metric analyses of cut mark width and depth are presented by Merritt et al. (2018) as a more objective method of identifying cut marks. However, this uni(bi)variate method has shown very high rates of mark classification error when structurally similar marks are compared. Furthermore, within-sample comparison carried out via subsampling shows that different datasets of metric values, obtained with the same type of tool and raw material, are subject to such a high degree of variability that significant differences of homogeneous subsamples are repeatedly obtained, thus preventing any useful analogs to be made. Additionally, this much higher stochastic variability depends on limited knowledge of the contextual processes that intervene in cut mark metric properties, as well as on a mismatch between theoretical premises on the immanent-configurational process-trace dynamics and their confusion during experimental praxis. The selection of specific contextual variables and disregard of others, in addition to the combination of different tool types and raw materials, distorts the resulting cut mark properties. This indicates that even when attempting to use exclusively metric numeric variables, subjectivity is a conditioning factor in analyzing and interpreting cut marks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bone surface modifications; Cut mark; Heuristics; Morphology; Statistical power; Taphonomy",,Note,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053308018

Fortunately, only some of the mechanical properties and almost none of the mathematical complexity are needed to understand the important functional properties of bone. In life, the important mechanical properties result in a bone that is strong, tough and sufficiently long lived that it does not hurt or break when we use it! Whole bone properties come both from the structure (the anatomy) and the material properties of the hard tissue. This chapter considers the effects of anatomy first and then examines key mechanical properties of the hard tissue that are essential to function. It aims to understand the mechanical properties of bone without the engineering complexity. The chapter uses example mechanical tests as illustrations and relegates mathematical analysis to separate sections. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

An example of this equifinality can be found in the differentiation between anthropic cut marks and other traces on bone produced by natural agents, such as that of sedimentary abrasion and trampling. These issues are a key component in the understanding of early human evolution, yet frequently rely on qualitative features for their identification. Unfortunately, qualitative data is commonly susceptible to subjectivity, producing insecurity in research through analyst experience. The present study intends to confront these issues through a hybrid methodological approach. Here, we combine Geometric Morphometric data, 3D digital microscopy, and Deep Learning Neural Networks to provide a means of empirically classifying taphonomic traces on bone. Results obtained are able to reach over 95% classification, providing a possible means of overcoming taphonomic equifinality in the archaeological and paleontological register. © 2019 by the authors.","Archaeological data science; Equifinality; Microscopy; Taphonomy",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079169593
