As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle ΔABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0, 0) and landmark B to (1, 0). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S, which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling’s T2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions at an angle averaging 90° in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal grid pair. © 1986, Statistical Science.

Using low-cost and high-volume hand lens and low-power light microscope techniques, we determined the presence or absence of conspicuous and inconspicuous marks with 97% three-way correspondence, and diagnosed marks of known origin to actor and effector with 99% accuracy. Novices with less than 3 h training on control collections correctly diagnosed 86% of classic but mainly inconspicuous marks. Novices spending several more hours studying control specimens elevated their diagnostic accuracy on morphologically representative marks to near-expert levels of 95%. Our results show that published cautions about mimicry among cut marks, percussion marks, and carnivore tooth marks are overstated. All types of marks examined can be identified reliably, regardless of conspicuousness. As such, fully standardized comparisons of mark frequencies can be drawn among assemblages, even those documented by different analysts. However, such robust interpretations can be attained only if analysts base diagnoses on (a) a firm familiarity with bones marked under strictly controlled conditions, (b) the systematic application of published morphological and contextual criteria, and (c) the use of prescribed low-power magnification techniques. © 1996 Academic Press Limited.","Blind tests; Bone modification; Cut marks; Percussion marks; Taphonomy; Tooth marks; Zooarchaeology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000445678

When too few landmarks are available, outlines can be digitized as series of discrete points. The individual points must be slid along a tangential direction so as to remove tangential variation, because contours should be homologous from subject to subject whereas their individual points need not. This variation can be removed by minimizing either bending energy (BE) or Procrustes distance (D) with respect to a mean reference form. Because these two criteria make different assumptions, it becomes necessary to study how these differences modify the results obtained. We performed bootstrapped-based Goodall's F-test, Foote's measurement, principal component (PC) and discriminant function analyses on human molars and craniometric data to compare the results obtained by the two criteria. Results show that: (1) F-scores and P-values were similar for both criteria; (2) results of Foote's measurement show that both criteria yield different estimates of within- and between-sample variation; (3) there is low correlation between the first PC axes obtained by D and BE; (4) the percentage of correct classification is similar for BE and D, but the ordination of groups along discriminant scores differs between them. The differences between criteria can alter the results when morphological variation in the sample is small, as in the analysis of modern human populations. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation. © 2006 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Dental and facial data; Minimum bending energy; Minimum Procrustes distance","accuracy; anthropometric parameters; article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; correlation analysis; craniofacial morphology; functional assessment; geometry; human; intermethod comparison; molar tooth; priority journal; reference value; scoring system; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Dentition; Facial Bones; Humans; Male; Models, Anatomic; Molar",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744472832

We use geometric morphometrics to quantify the diversity of skull shape in 106 breeds of domestic dog, in three wild canid species, and across the order Carnivora. The amount of shape variation among domestic dogs far exceeds that in wild species, and it is comparable to the disparity throughout the Carnivora. The greatest shape distances between dog breeds clearly surpass the maximum divergence between species in the Carnivora. Moreover, domestic dogs occupy a range of novel shapes outside the domain of wild carnivorans. The disparity among companion dogs substantially exceeds that of other classes of breeds, suggesting that relaxed functional demands facilitated diversification. Much of the diversity of dog skull shapes stems from variation between short and elongate skulls and from modularity of the face versus that of the neurocranium. These patterns of integration and modularity apply to variation among individuals and breeds, but they also apply to fluctuating asymmetry, indicating they have a shared developmental basis. These patterns of variation are also found for the wolf and across the Carnivora, suggesting that they existed before the domestication of dogs and are not a result of selective breeding. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.","Canis familiaris; Carnivora; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological integration; Novelty; Selection","canid; carnivore; domestic species; evolutionary biology; functional morphology; geographical variation; morphometry; natural selection; neurology; reproductive behavior; skull; species diversity; animal; article; comparative study; coyote; dog; evolution; histology; jackal; physiology; skull; wolf; Animals; Biological Evolution; Coyotes; Dogs; Jackals; Skull; Wolves; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Carnivora",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949511896

Usually these analyses have been performed by means of classic morphometric methods, including the measurement of relative cusp areas or the angles defined between cusps. Although these studies have provided valuable information for the morphological characterization of some hominin species, we believe that the analysis of this particular tooth could be more conclusive for taxonomic assignment. In this study, we have applied geometric morphometric methods to explore the morphological variability of the upper first molar (M1) across the human fossil record. Our emphasis focuses on the study of the phenetic relationships among the European middle Pleistocene populations (designated as H. heidelbergensis) with H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, but the inclusion of Australopithecus and early Homo specimens has helped us to assess the polarity of the observed traits. H. neanderthalensis presents a unique morphology characterized by a relatively distal displacement of the lingual cusps and protrusion in the external outline of a large and bulging hypocone. This morphology can be found in a less pronounced degree in the European early and middle Pleistocene populations, and reaches its maximum expression with the H. neanderthalensis lineage. In contrast, modern humans retain the primitive morphology with a square occlusal polygon associated with a round external outline. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

They then spread across the Middle and Near East and westward into Europe alongside early agriculturalists. European pigs were either domesticated independently or more likely appeared so as a result of admixture between introduced pigs and European wild boar. As a result, European wild boar mtDNA lineages replaced Near Eastern/Anatolian mtDNA signatures in Europe and subsequently replaced indigenous domestic pig lineages in Anatolia. The specific details of these processes, however, remain unknown. To address questions related to early pig domestication, dispersal, and turnover in the Near East, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA and dental geometric morphometric variation in 393 ancient pig specimens representing 48 archeological sites (from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic to the Medieval period) from Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Our results reveal the first genetic signatures of early domestic pigs in the Near Eastern Neolithic core zone. We also demonstrate that these early pigs differed genetically from those in western Anatolia that were introduced to Europe during the Neolithic expansion. In addition, we present a significantly more refined chronology for the introduction of European domestic pigs into Asia Minor that took place during the Bronze Age, at least 900 years earlier than previously detected. By the 5th century AD, European signatures completely replaced the endemic lineages possibly coinciding with the widespread demographic and societal changes that occurred during the Anatolian Bronze and Iron Ages. © 2012 The Author 2012.

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

Its frequent preservation in the fossil record gives the temporal bone added significance in the study of human evolution, but its morphology has proven difficult to quantify. In this study we use techniques of 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify differences among humans and great apes and discuss the results in a phylogenetic context. Twenty-three landmarks on the ectocranial surface of the temporal bone provide a high level of anatomical detail. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) is used to register (adjust for position, orientation and scale) landmark data from 405 adults representing Homo, Pan, Gorilla and Pongo. Principal components analysis of residuals from the GPA shows that the major source of variation is between humans and apes. Human characteristics such as a coronally orientated petrous axis, a deep mandibular fossa, a projecting mastoid process, and reduced lateral extension of the tympanic element strongly impact the analysis. In phenetic cluster analyses, gorillas and orangutans group together with respect to chimpanzees, and all apes group together with respect to humans. Thus, the analysis contradicts depictions of African apes as a single morphotype. Gorillas and orangutans lack the extensive preglenoid surface of chimpanzees, and their mastoid processes are less medially inflected. These and other characters shared by gorillas and orangutans are probably primitive for the African hominid clade.","Geometric morphometrics; Hominids; Hominoids; Relative warp analysis; Thin-plate spline analysis","Africa; analytic method; Anthropoidea; ape; article; bone structure; chimpanzee; cladistics; cluster analysis; comparative anatomy; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; evolution; fossil; geographical variation (species); geometry; gorilla; hominid; human; human versus animal comparison; mandible; mastoid; middle ear; morphometrics; morphotype; nonhuman; orang utan; Pan paniscus; petrous bone; phylogeny; priority journal; register; structure analysis; temporal bone; Adult; Animals; Gorilla gorilla; Hominidae; Humans; Pan troglodytes; Phylogeny; Pongo pygmaeus; Temporal Bone; Alocasia macrorrhizos; Animalia; Anthropoidea; Hominidae; Homo; Pan (ape); Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Paniscus; Pongo; Pongo pygmaeus; Procrustes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18744389738

Here, criteria for distinguishing natural (fluvial) from cultural salmonid deposits are developed in order to determine the agents responsible for the Roadcut faunal materials. Comparative analysis of one natural and three cultural assemblages from riverine settings indicates that body-part representation and skeletal completeness vary between natural and cultural settings.

Recent developments include the study of the center-of-mass motion of swimming fish and the use of volumetric imaging systems that allow three-dimensional instantaneous snapshots of wake flow patterns. The large numbers of swimming fish in the oceans and the vorticity present in fin and body wakes support the hypothesis that fish contribute significantly to the mixing of ocean waters.

Despite otoliths having only a few, sparsely located, homologous landmarks, GM appeared slightly more efficient in distinguishing the sagittae of the four species and allowed visualization of the modification of otolith shape as they grow. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Engraulididae; Form factors; Fourier analysis; Sagittae; Size; Thin-plate spline","animal; article; audiovisual equipment; biometry; computer graphics; fish; Fourier analysis; histology; physiology; ultrastructure; vestibule; Animals; Biometry; Computer Graphics; Fishes; Fourier Analysis; Models, Anatomic; Otolithic Membrane; Encrasicholina devisi; Engraulidae; Stolephorus indicus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646853319

We analysed a grey triggerfish (Balistes carolinensis) assemblage from Atlit-Yam, a submerged Pre-Pottery Neolithic site (8140-7550 BP) off the Mediterranean coast of Israel, using multiple taphonomic criteria and quantitative analyses. The clumped distribution of remains, the high bone scatter frequency, the presence of a few burnt bones, the bones' state of fragmentation, the absence of a correlation between bone density and bone frequency, the low species diversity and wide range of body sizes represented, all point to a culturally derived assemblage. The high percentage of identifiable elements, the occurrence of most skeletal elements, and the virtual absence of branchial region bones, are compatible with fish gutted for immediate or later consumption, and incompatible with the expected of refuse. Cranial bones and first dorsal spines of large individuals were missing, apparently a result of size-dependent butchering methods. The emergent picture is of a pile of fish gutted and processed in a size-dependent manner, and then stored for future consumption or trade. This scenario suggests that technology for fish storage was already available, and that the Atlit-Yam inhabitants could enjoy the economic stability resulting from food storage and trade with mainland sites. © 2001 Academic Press.","Balistes carolinensis; Fish processing; Fish storage; Fish trade; Neolithic; Taphonomy; Triggerfish","archaeological evidence; fish; food processing; Holocene; Neolithic; taphonomy; Israel",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034799290

As such, heterochrony is thought to be a common evolutionary mechanism in the generation of diversity. Previous research has suggested that dogs evolved via heterochrony and are paedomorphic wolves. This study uses three-dimensional landmark-based coordinate data to investigate heterochronic patterns within the skull morphology of the domestic dog. A total of 677 adult dogs representing 106 different breeds were measured and compared with an ontogenetic series of 401 wolves. Geometric morphometric analysis reveals that the cranial shape of none of the modern breeds of dogs resembles the cranial shapes of adult or juvenile wolves. In addition, investigations of regional heterochrony in the face and neurocranium also reject the hypothesis of heterochrony. Throughout wolf cranial development the position of the face and the neurocranium remain in the same plane. Dogs, however, have a de novo cranial flexion in which the palate is tilted dorsally in brachycephalic and mesaticephalic breeds or tilted ventrally in dolichocephalic and down-face breeds. Dogs have evolved very rapidly into an incredibly morphologically diverse species with very little genetic variation. However, the genetic alterations to dog cranial development that have produced this vast range of phylogenetically novel skull shapes do not coincide with the expectations of the heterochronic model.

Using molar shape geometric morphometric analysis, archaeological Sus dental series from the Sarawak caves of Niah (Aceramic, Neolithic) and Lobang Kudih (Ming period), are compared with extant ISEA wild pigs to establish their taxonomic status and to further explore the evidence for local domestication or introduction of allochthonous populations. Results on modern data-sets show that outline analysis of the third lower molar achieves highly significant inter- and intra-specific differentiation among ISEA wild pigs, with a phenotypic divergence structure displaying congruence with molecular phylogenies. Both tooth shape and mtDNA evidence strongly suggest the so-called wild pigs of New Guinea to be the descendants of pigs domesticated in mainland South East Asia and introduced by early farmers to ISEA. None of our data provide clear evidence for a Neolithic introduction of domesticated pigs, or for the local domestication of indigenous bearded pigs, since all Aceramic and Neolithic pigs from Niah cave have been identified as indigenous bearded pig (Sus barbatus). Local domestication experiments by foragers have not been ruled out, since evidence of hypoplasia as a marker of domestication processes has been observed. Introduction of allochthonous domestic pigs between the Late Neolithic and the Metal Age is suggested, since this small domestic breed from Lobang Kudih cave displays strong phenetic relationships with S. scrofa of New Guinea, recognised by molecular phylogeography as part of the 'Pacific Clade' linked both with Lapita and Polynesian dispersals. Introduction of celebensis-like species has also been suggested. Future studies should incorporate broader time-scale and geographical framework data-sets to strengthen these assumptions.

ABSTRACT. - Relationships between the size of otoliths and vertebrae, and body length are presented for eleven teleost species of the north-east Atlantic. Relationships between teleost size and weight are also presented for these species. These equations can be used to reconstruct the original dimensions of prey from the size of hard structures found in food samples of marine piscivores. For each fish species we selected otoliths and vertebrae which possessed unique features enabling diagnosis of specimens to the level of genus or species. Linear and non-linear functions provided the best fit for relations between hard structure size and fish length, and exponential functions yielded the best predictors for fish weight. For some species, the relationships obtained in this study differed from similar functions obtained by other authors at different locations. This calls for caution when using equations derived from specimens on other locations, especially if precise quantitative data are required.","ANE; Diet; Identification; Otoliths; Regression analysis; Teleostei; Vertebrae",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034736481

GMMs were used because they allow standard multivariate analyses while preserving information about scale shape, which is important in making biological interpretations of results. The method was tested on ctenoid scales from mullets collected from different areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Aegean Sea. Scales were submitted to generalised procrustes analysis, followed by principal components analysis of resulting shape coordinates. Principal component scores were submitted to cross-validated discriminant analysis to determine the efficacy of scale landmarks in discriminating by taxon and population. Fish scale form was least effective in discriminating populations from nearby areas, better when populations are more geographically dispersed, and best between species and genera. Scale form variations reflected previous genetic studies that differentiated congeneric Mugil cephalus and Mugil curema, which are distinct from other Mugilidae.

The size and shape of our ancestors' anatomical features have long been the focus of research on hominin systematics, phylogeny, functional morphology, ontogeny, variation, and evolutionary change. Early physical anthropologists relied on both qualitative descriptions of anatomical shape and linear measurements to assess variation among hominins. The seminal works of W. W. Howells1 and C. E. Oxnard2 helped to bring multivariate techniques to the forefront of physical anthropology. Howells' intention was the objective delineation of components of shape, which could then fuel further analyses and interpretations, as well as clarification of the ways that growth influences interindividual and interpopulational differences in shape. He expressed concern that previous comparisons of individual measurements did not capture the overall shape of the skull, which is ""expressed by the relations between measurements."" 1:3 Similarly, Oxnard recognized that a multivariate approach to the study of complex shapes allows ""for such perturbations (e.g., variation and covariation)...that are difficult to evaluate by eye and impossible to reveal by measurement and simple analysis alone."" 2:6 While multivariate methods offered clear advantages over univariate or bivariate representations of shape, the analysis of traditional morphometric measures such as linear distances, angles, and ratios, has limitations when it comes to quantifying the complex geometry of some anatomical structures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Allometry; Integration; Modularity; Paleoanthropology; Shape analysis; Systematics","algorithm; article; cephalometry; evolution; histology; human; methodology; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; paleontology; phylogeny; skull; Algorithms; Biological Evolution; Body Weights and Measures; Cephalometry; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Paleontology; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865331150

The fish remains provide the first glimpse into the naturally accumulated fish assemblage from the fluctuating shores of a lake that had been continually exploited by early hominins some 780,000 years ago. Preliminary analysis of the remains show that thirteen of the seventeen species native to Lake Hula were identified at GBY. These represent three of the five freshwater fish families native to the lake: Cyprinidae (carps), Cichlidae (tilapini, St. Peter's fish), and Clariidae (catfish). From a taphonomical perspective, a significant difference is found between the two lithofacies (Layers I-4 and I-5) in terms of species composition, richness, diversity, and skeleton completeness. It appears that the fish remains recovered from Layer I-4 (clay) are better preserved than those from Layer I-5 (coquina). In both lithofacies, Cyprinidae are highly abundant while Cichlidae and Clariidae are rare and under-represented, especially when compared to the Lake Hula fishery report from the 1950s. All of these identified species may have contributed significantly to the diet of GBY hominins. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Acheulian; Barbus; Freshwater fish; Lacustrine taphonomy; Mirogrex; Tristramella","fish; lacustrine environment; skeletal remains; skeleton; species diversity; species richness; taphonomy; Gesher Benot Ya'aqov; Israel; Northern District; Barbus; Cichlidae; Clariidae; Cyprinidae; Cypriniformes; Tristramella; Zeidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952360290

Otoliths and vertebrae give slightly different age distributions but it is possible to arrive at similar seasonality estimations in both structures when information from the literature and our own date from monthly captures of plaice from the North Sea are taken into account. These modern data show that the timing of annulus formation in otoliths and vertebrae is more or less similar. Back-calculations on vertebrae and otoliths yield similar growth curves. The age distribution, the edge condition of both vertebrae and otoliths, and the growth rate obtained on the material from Raversijde all show that the plaice from the studied assemblage were captured during spring in the southern part of the North Sea. Vertebrae are commonly preserved in archaeological sites whereas otoliths rarely survive. Although they are more difficult to read than otoliths, vertebrae of plaice can be used for growth increment analyses, and the growth rates obtained from vertebrae from archaeological sites can, therefore, be compared in the future to growth data from modern otoliths studied in sea fisheries research. Archaeozoological material predating industrialized fishing since the 19th century can hence serve as a reference in the study of the compensatory response of commercially important species to heavy exploitation.

Zooarchaeologists have attempted to study these changes osteologically in their search for the geographic and temporal origins of initial animal domestication during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Traditional biometric approaches have explored broad changes in body size over time, but this approach provides poor resolution. Here we investigate whether geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of cranial shape can be used to provide better resolution between wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), since shape is less affected by environmental factors than size. GMM combined with traditional multivariate statistics were applied to the crania of 42 modern domestic pigs (representing 6 breeds), 10 wild×domestic first generation hybrid pigs and 55 adult wild boar. Further analyses were carried out on morphologically discrete portions of the crania to simulate the fragmented nature of archaeological mammal remains. We found highly significant discrimination between wild and domestic pigs, both on the whole crania, and subsets including the parietal, the basicranium, the angle of the nasal and the zygomatic. We also demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate different domestic breeds on the basis of cranial morphology, and that 1st generation hybrid wild×domestic pig morphology more closely resembles wild pigs than domestic, suggesting that a wild phenotype (here represented by morphology) is dominant over a recessive domestic one. Our data demonstrate that GMM techniques can provide a quantifiable, clear classification between wild and domestic Sus (even using partial cranial remains) which has significant implications for zooarchaeological research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Crania; Domestication; Geometric morphometrics; Sus scrofa; Zooarchaeology","archaeology; biometry; body size; domestication; Holocene; morphometry; phenotype; pig; three-dimensional modeling; Animalia; Crania; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892961583

We wish to explore information loss in a bone assemblage relative to the original, living community. We examined fish bone assemblages from lacustrine sediments along the southern shore of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) and compared them to modern living communities. For this purpose we randomly selected 24 squares, each 0.5 m2 in size, and excavated them to a depth of 30-50 cm. Three lithofacies were recovered, spanning the past 1500 years (unccorected for reservoir age). The fish remains include 5037 bones and 758 scales, of which 1566 bones were identified to taxonomic group. The list of identified species was compared with the list of indigenous species known to live in Lake Kinneret in general and in a similar sandy habitat in particular. The proportion of skeletal elements found was compared with the proportion known in a complete fish. Our study indicates that differences exist between the three lithofacies in species diversity and composition, skeletal element richness, completeness, and relative abundance. In addition, the bones exhibit a clumped distribution pattern, regardless of depositional depth. From a taphonomic and paleoecological perspective, our findings demonstrate that fish remains retrieved from lacustrine sediments do not represent the composition and diversity of species as in the recent fish community. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of the islands are depauperate in terrestrial fauna and human subsistence must have focused on the marine environment. Although few islands have been archaeologically explored, some such as Timor have yielded abundant remains of pelagic and reef fishes, as well as the earliest evidence of fishhook manufacture, demonstrating that modern humans in this region were well equipped to undertake complex exploitation of the marine environment. However, a holistic understanding of human subsistence strategies on these islands from initial colonisation in the late Pleistocene through to the Recent remains elusive. Here, we present survey and excavation data from the site of Tron Bon Lei on the small island of Alor in Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia. This study focuses on the terminal Pleistocene – early Holocene human fishing behaviour in the region, and specifically the zooarchaeological sequence from Tron Bon Lei dated to this period. The Holocene preference for reef fish relative to pelagic fish, observed in mid-to late Holocene occupation levels in East Timor, occurred earlier in Tron Bon Lei, suggesting a shift from the larger abundance of carnivore taxa observed in the late Pleistocene deposits. Comparisons with other archaeological deposits in Wallacea indicates that fishing was an important subsistence activity in Nusa Tenggara Timur, unlike more northern Wallacean islands where shellfish make up almost all zooarchaeological records. Tron Bon Lei confirms that the faunally limited nature of Alor spans the Holocene, and we find no evidence that terrestrial fauna made up a significant component of the subsistence activities undertaken at this site. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Early Holocene; Marine resources; Subsistence strategies; Terminal Pleistocene; Wallacea","colonization; fauna; fish; Holocene; marine environment; marine resource; Pleistocene; settlement history; settlement pattern; Alor Islands; East Nusa Tenggara; Lesser Sunda Islands; Lesser Sunda Islands; Sunda Isles; Gabaza; Pisces",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951087515

The relative rank of the maximal vertebral length, height and width according to body length of the fishes is characteristic of the axial swimming groups; close to the head in the anguilliform group, it is localized near the middle of the vertebral axis in the subcarangiform one and very posteriorly in the two last ones (carangiform and thunniform) that look relatively similar.

Feeding adaptations of extant species is well documented by field observations; however, we are still missing palaeoecological insights for many enigmatic fossil specimens. We employ geometric morphometrics to quantify skull size and shape in extant and fossil members of the Canini tribe, inclusive of jackals and wolf-like taxa. Skull data are tested to identify correlates of dietary adaptations in extant species for predicting adaptations in fossils. Main vectors of shape variation correlate with the relative skull-palatal length, the position of the upper carnassial tooth and the anterior tip of the secondary palate. Allometry occurs in the palatal shape but size explains only a small fraction (about 4%) of shape variance. Although we quantified only palatal and tooth shape for the inclusion of fragmentary fossils, discriminant function analysis successfully classify extant Canini in dietary groups (small, medium and large prey specialist) with 89% of accuracy. The discriminant functions provide insights into many enigmatic specimens such as Eucyon adoxus (=small prey), fossil jackal-like from Koobi Fora formation (=small prey) and the Plio-Pleistocene Old World canid guild (Canis etruscus, C. arnensis and Lycaon falconeri). Clearly, both skull size and shape are excellent predictors of feeding habits in Canini thus also provide information about fossil taxonomic affinities. © 2014 The Zoological Society of London.","Canidae; Diet; Geometric morphometrics; Hypercarnivore; Skull shape","adaptation; canid; carnivore; diet; discriminant analysis; feeding behavior; fossil assemblage; morphometry; paleoecology; skull; taxonomy; tooth; Canidae; Canis; Lycaon; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923541744

The protocols include using the following: (1) the most commonly identified five paired cranial bones and 'specials' or unique elements; (2) an expanded number of cranial bones; and (3) the less common inclusion of all vertebrae. Explicit identification and quantification protocols are outlined for systematically incorporating all vertebrae which, predictably, increases the number of identified specimens for an assemblage, thus providing more bones useful for reconstructing live fish biomass (weight and length). Significantly, a range of unique archaeological vertebrae are useful for calculating minimum number of individuals. Using a well-preserved assemblage from Henderson Island, Pitcairn Group, southeast Polynesia, numbering 6480 fish bones (concentration index=21580m3), we demonstrate differences in rank-order abundance from three taxon identification protocols. For example, when using all vertebrae grouper (Serranidae) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) are more numerically equivalent than when relying mostly on cranial bones for identification for minimum number of individuals and number of identified specimens. This has important implications for making comparisons between sites or across regions where different identification protocols were used. This pilot study demonstrates that using all vertebrae for taxon identification and quantification, not just unique hypurals (terminal vertebrae) or those from sharks and rays (Elasmobranchii), should be standard practice for identifying a greater number of bones to taxon and thereby providing better reconstructions of prehistoric fishing and subsistence practices in the Pacific. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Fish vertebrae analysis; Henderson Island; Polynesia; Prehistoric fishing",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954402771

Conversely, in Pacific Island archaeological fishing studies, vertebrae that are not identified to taxon have been utilised to assess change in average fish vertebrae size, and to reconstruct changes in fish length and weight over time. Using a fish bone assemblage from a prehistoric habitation site on Ebon Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, we report false trends when vertebrae - not identified to taxon and type - are used to assess differences in average vertebrae size among cultural layers. These results are compared to the same assemblage where taxon and vertebra type are used to more accurately determine fish size.

The association of the fish-hooks with a human burial, combined with the lack of alternative protein sources on the island, suggest that fishing was an important part of the cosmology of this community.

The method involves regression equations calculated from a reference collection of 36 meagre skeletons and 113 meagre otoliths (sagitta) and allows the simultaneous estimation of original body size and minimum number of individuals (MNI) from archaeological bone structures. We selected the following measurements to predict meagre body size: greatest dorso-ventral height, greatest mediolateral breadth, and greatest anteroposterior length of the vertebrae centra; maximum anteroposterior length, medial anteroposterior length, and dorso-ventral height of the sagitta. Our results show that the original body size of meagre can be accurately predicted from many bone measurements (r2 range: 0.921-0.992). We exemplify the use of the regressions in the assessment of size variation and MNI of meagre from four Portuguese Mesolithic sites.

Methodological difficulties, however, such as the lack of diagnostic features permitting taxonomic and anatomical identification of fish bones, often results in only a small fraction of a fish assemblage analysed. Taphonomic processes are often not explicitly considered in many aquatic zooarchaeological analyses, leading to a dearth of information on how post-depositional processes may have affected the preservation of fish remains. Here we examine different methodological approaches to the analysis of fish elements recovered from an archaeological site in Indonesia, Tron Bon Lei (Alor, East Nusa Tenggara). We compare the results obtained through more traditional icthyoarchaeology methods, where only specific diagnostic bones are included in the analysis, to those attained when every bone recovered from the site is considered. In doing so, we also describe the entire archaeological sequence of Tron Bon Lei, which had previously only been partly presented. The analysis of the entire archaeological deposit confirms that the Alor inhabitants were intensively exploiting marine resources, while the contribution of terrestrial vertebrates to diet was very limited. Small individuals of inshore ray-finned fishes are more abundant in every layer, with limited evidence of fishing of larger individuals. Nevertheless, larger individuals and open water bony fishes are better represented in the late Pleistocene layers than in the late Holocene deposits. These results suggest changes in sea level may be the main factor responsible for these variations, although the role played by changes in fishing technology and human-induced resource depression needs to be considered. Our results show that analysis of the entirety of an assemblage allows for stronger inferences to be drawn about skeletal representation and taphonomic processes, and thus better informs human maritime subsistence strategies during the late Quaternary in Island Southeast Asia. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030780824

Here we present (I) a species classification rate for the two species using modern reference specimens, and (II) an application on archaeological vertebrae of Salmo sp. recovered from the cave of Le Taillis des Coteaux (Vienne, France). This cave contains a rich archaeological sequence with an exceptionally well preserved stratigraphy, encompassing the Upper Paleolithic from the Aurignacian to the Middle Magdalenian. To discriminate both species, we used a geometric morphometric approach to analyse vertebral form using landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks, coupled with k-Nearest Neighbour classification method. Other quantitative approaches like Principal Component Analyses exist, but the k-NN method increases the power of these analyses. Linear Discriminant Analysis was also used; however, the k-NN method provided better results. This study presents the initial results of geometric morphometric discrimination of European salmonid bones. The success rate of reassigning these to the modern reference specimens ranged from 84 to 100%, depending on the vertebrae studied, with the data indicating that S. trutta sspp. were the dominant taxon on site. This study provides clear evidence that vertebrae morphology can be used to differentiate salmonid species, allowing archaeological specimens, even partially broken, to be identified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Geometric morphometrics; Le Taillis des Coteaux; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; Species identification; Upper Paleolithic; Vertebrae","archaeology; bioindicator; identification method; morphology; morphometry; Paleolithic; salmonid; taxonomy; France; Poitou-Charentes; Vienne; Salmo salar; Salmo sp.; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949036039

Vicentina. México, D.F., 09340, Mexico","Fish traceability is an important tool in fish food safety and a recognition tool in the assessment of biodiversity and fisheries. Geometric morphometric methods were used to establish whether scale morphology may determine the origin of specimens from a fish market. In order to trace the origin of fish, the fish scale shape of two mugilids species Mugil cephalus and Mugil curema specimens from three different trade premises at the Mexico City central fish market was analyzed and compared with the scale shape of previously collected samples from known areas along the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific coasts. The origin of the fish market specimens was kept in a closed envelope and was revealed at the end of the study. Scale shape was described using seven landmarks, the coordinates of which were subjected to a generalised Procrustes analysis, followed by a principal components analysis and discriminant analysis. Discriminant classification was used as the main indicator to identify the source of the fish, where the percentage of discrimination traced the origin of the specimens, respectively. A leave-one-out procedure was applied to validate the results of discriminant functions on shape, and relative warp in size-shape space (shape plus size). Results showed that the discriminant analysis correctly classified 83.3% of the cases, with 100% for adjacent geographic areas. The relative warp in size-shape space (shape plus size) of fish scales could be used to reliably trace fish populations by applying geometric morphometric methods to one fish scale per specimen. In order to effectively use such an approach in fisheries management, it is necessary to have previous patterns of fish scale shapes for each locality. Since the scale shape was described using seven landmarks, it may be possible to improve the tracing rate by increasing the number of landmarks used. Fish scale shape thus offers a straightforward, accessible, quick and inexpensive method to trace fish stocks. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Fish scale shape; Fish traceability; Fisheries management; Geometric morphometrics; Gulf of Mexico; Mugil cephalus; Mugil curema; Stock identification","Mugil cephalus; Mugil curema; Mugilidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930635670

The main objectives were to determine the number of fish captured and their species. Classical taxonomic classification and multivariate morphometry indicated the existence of three species in the landings from Rio de Janeiro State (Caranx crysos, Carangoides bartholomaei and Caranx latus). The results of the genetic analyses performed were consistent with these results. However, Bayesian analysis revealed the possible presence of a fourth species, which could not be discriminated by classical taxonomy. Caranx crysos possibly comprises two different species. Other population indexes, such as unique alleles, degree of structuring and genetic identity, also pointed to different species. Therefore, based on evidences from classical taxonomy, geometric morphometric analyses together with genetic data from allozymes molecular markers it is possible to support that at least four different Carangidae species are present in fish landings from Niterói, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, whereas fish capture records for the same location have recorded only two species.
