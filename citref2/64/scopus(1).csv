As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

With the simultaneous use of five characters of the hip bone, it is possible to provide a correct sexual diagnosis in 95% of all cases, with an error of 2% and an inability to identify sex in only 3%. The advantage of this new method is a reduction in observer subjectivity, since the evaluation procedure cannot involve any anticipation of the result.

Mechanisms of injury are categorized as direct and indirect trauma, stress, and fracture that occurs secondary to pathology. These are considered to be the proximate, or most direct, causes of injury and they are influenced by intrinsic biological factors such as age and sex, and extrinsic environmental factors, both physical and sociocultural, that may be thought of as the ultimate, or remote, causes of injury. Interpersonal conflict may be one of those causes but the skeletal evidence itself is rarely conclusive and must therefore be evaluated in its individual, populational, sociocultural, and physical context.

These advances have provoked some controversy. The major aims of this review are to put these debates in context and to provide an overview for the nonmathematician. The purpose of morphometric studies is considered, together with issues relating to the nature, significance and identification of landmarks before turning to a review of available technologies for the analysis of morphological variation. These are considered in terms of underlying models and assumptions in order to clarify when each is appropriate. To illustrate the application of these methods, 3 example studies are presented. The first examines differences amongst ancient and modern adult human crania using 2-dimensional data. The second illustrates the extension of these methods into 3 dimensions in a study of facial growth in monkeys. The third presents an application to the analysis of the form of the hominoid talus.

Iowa Hosp., Iowa City, Ia. 52242, United States","Postmortem studies of 10 normal fullterm infants and of 3 children, 7, 9, and 14 years old, showed that the acetabular cartilage complex is a unit that is triradiate medially and cup-shaped laterally and is interposed between the ilium, ischium, and pubis. This complex is composed of epiphyseal growth-plate cartilage adjacent to these bones, of articular cartilage around the acetabular cavity, and, for the most part, of hyaline cartilage. Interstitial growth within the triradiate part of the cartilage complex causes the hip socket to expand during growth. The concavity of the acetabulum develops in response to the presence of the spherical femoral head. The depth of the acetabulum increases during development as the result of interstitial growth in the acetabular cartilage, of appositional growth at the periphery of this cartilage, and of periosteal new-bone formation at the acetabular margin. At puberty, three secondary centers of ossification appear in the hyaline cartilage surrounding the acetabular cavity. These centers are homologous with other epiphyses in the skeleton. The os acetabuli, which is the epiphysis of the os pubis, forms the anterior wall of the acetabulum. The epiphysis of the ilium, which has been called the acetabular epiphysis, forms a good part of the superior wall of the acetabulum. A small epiphysis of the ischium was seen in the oldest patient, who was fourteen years old. The bone in these epiphyses expands toward the periphery of the acetabulum and thus contributes to its increase in depth.",,"acetabulum; autopsy; bone; bone growth; hip radiography; histology; joint; newborn; normal human; preschool child; school child; diagnosis; growth; infant",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018146757

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The genetical behaviour of a number of skeletal characters which differentiate the pure lines CBA and C57BL is described in crosses between these two strains, between C57BL and A, and in some subsidiary experiments. 2. The results indicate that the entities investigated are 'quasi-continuous' characters in the sense that the underlying genetic basis is a continuous variable (generally not yet identified) with multiple factor inheritance which is divided by a physiological threshold into normal and abnormal animals; the abnormality is usually itself capable of graded expression. 3. The peculiar genetical properties of quasi-continuous characters are regarded as partly due to the fact that a continuous distribution may occupy any position in relation to a physiological threshold; and partly that they share with ordinary continuous variables the multiple gene basis and the sensitivity to influences of the environment, both prenatal and post-natal. 4. It is suggested that additiveness of gene effects and sensitivity to the environment may trace back to the common cause that the so-called multiple genes of quantitative genetics are in fact remote gene effects. It is pointed out that arbitrarily chosen parameters will generally be influenced by genes only indirectly; and as every measurement involves a choice and is thus arbitrary, the multiple gene inheritance generally encountered in quantitative genetics may be due to the arbitrary choice of parameters rather than to inherent causes. © 1953 Indian Academy of Sciences.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002094381

Earlier Sullivan observed that discrete traits could be particularly valuable where artificial cranial deformation limits the use of craniometry. Twenty‐eight minor variants were studied in bifronto‐occipitally deformed and undeformed skulls of a sample of 78 from a single Hopewell mound. The pattern of frequency differences between deformed and undeformed with respect to traits at the back of the vault and in the frontal region, interpreted in developmental terms, reveals a hypostotic effect in these regions in the deformed skull; while, in contrast, traits of the lateral vault, facial skeleton and cranial base point to a general hyperostotic effect in these regions. Each of three emissaria tends to be more constant in the deformed. That minor cranial variants manifest a plastic response to this type of environmentally‐imposed stress is consistent with the nature of such variants as elucidated by genetics research in mice. The findings suggest that deformed crania should be excluded from population studies in which genetic divergence between groups is estimated in terms of cranial trait frequencies.

It has been hypothesized that, owing to opposing selection pressures on pelvic morphology in females between efficiency in locomotion and obstetric adequacy, female pelvic morphology is less variable than that in males. The hypothesis was supported based on data derived from observational methods of sexing pelves (Meindl et al., 1985). The hypothesis was tested in the present study based on a metrical analysis of the true pelvis. The results show that there are no sexual differences in pelvic variability. Consequently, while males and females are equally variable in the dimensions of the true pelvis, the visual cues that osteologists use to sex pelves are more variable in males.

In general, studies have focused on their presence in the upper limb, which is used in the majority of daily activities. The aim of this study was to use some of the attachment sites on the humerus to explore the relationship between enthesopathy formation, activity, and the ageing process. The skeletal sample used in this study comprised male adult skeletons with known age-at-death and known occupations from the late-19th and early-20th century cemeteries in Portugal. The enthesopathies were recorded as either present or absent. Statistical analysis using Fishers exact tests and logistic regression was undertaken to determine whether associations could be found between specific activities or socioeconomic status (manual or nonmanual workers), and age and enthesopathy presence. Left and right sides were analyzed separately. Fisher's exact tests were used to determine the relationship between activity and enthesopathy, and they demonstrated no association between activity and enthesopathies (P > 0.01). The results of the logistic regression established that age was the single most significant factor in enthesopathy formation (P > 0.05). This study found that, in these samples, age-at-death, and therefore age-related degeneration rather than degeneration caused by activities, was the primary cause of enthesopathy formation. Considering the difficulties of reliably ageing adult human skeletal remains, this is a major issue for studies of activity using enthesopathies.

Sch., Dallas, TX 75235, United States","Traumatic disruption of the acetabular triradiate physeal cartilage is an infrequent injury. When it occurs during adolescence, subsequent growth changes in acetabular morphology and congruency of the hip joint are unlikely. However, in younger children, especially those who are less than ten years old, acetabular growth abnormality is a frequent complication of this injury and may result in a shallow acetabulum similar to that seen in patients with congenital disease of the hip. By the time of skeletal maturity, disparate growth increases the incongruency of the hip joint and may lead to progressively more severe subluxation of the hip. Acetabular reconstruction may be necessary to correct the gradual subluxation of the femoral head. Variable irregularities of growth at the proximal end of the femur also may occur. In this series, nine patients with triradiate physeal-cartilage injury were classified according to the degree of displacement and the probable type of growth-plate disruption. Two main patterns of injury occurred. The first was a shearing type -1 or 2 growth-mechanism injury, with central displacement of the distal portion of the acetabulum. This injury pattern seems to have a favorable prognosis for continued normal acetabular growth, although premature closure of the triradiate physes may occur. The other pattern appeared to be a crushing type-5 growth mechanism injury. This type has a poor prognosis, with premature closure of the triradiate physes occurring secondary to the formation of a medial osseous bridge. In either pattern, the prognosis is dependent on the age of the patient at the time of injury and on the extent of chondro-osseous disruption.",,"diagnosis; hip radiography; injury; musculoskeletal system; school child; therapy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020078886

Studies of nonmetric traits in human groups and in inbred strains of mice and rabbits have indicated a genetic component to nonmetric trait variation. Skeletons of animals with known matrilineage membership were obtained from the Cayo Santiago skeletal collection in order to obtain a direct estimate of the heritabilities of several nonmetric traits in the free‐ranging population of rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago. Falconer's (1965) method was used to calculate heritability. Heritability estimates range from zero to one, and half of them are greater than 0.5. This indicates that there is a considerable amount of genetic variation for these traits among the Cayo macaques. There is a significant tendency for traits scoring the number of foramina to have lower heritabilities than those scoring hyperstotic or hypostotic traits.

However, researchers disagree in the identification and obstetric significance of pelvic dimorphisms. This study addresses three issues. First, common patterns in dimorphism are identified by analysis of pelvimetrics from six independent samples (Whites and Blacks of known sex and four Amerindian samples of unknown sex). Second, an hypothesis is tested that the index of pelvic dimorphism (female mean × 100/male mean) is inversely related to pelvic variability. Third, the pelvic dimensions of the Neandertal male from Kebara cave, Israel are compared with those of the males in this study. The results show that the pelvic inlet is the plane of least dimorphism in humans. The reason that reports often differ in the identification of dimorphisms for this pelvic plane is that both the length of the pubis and the shape of the inlet are related to nutrition. The dimensions of the pelvis that are most dimorphic (that is, female larger than male) are the measures of posterior space, angulation of sacrum, biischial breadth, and subpubic angle. Interestingly, these dimensions are also the most variable. The hypothesis that variability and dimorphism are inversely related fails to be supported. The factors that influence pelvic variability are discussed. The Kebara 2 pelvis has a spacious inlet and a confined outlet relative to modern males, though the circumferences of both planes in the Neandertal are within the range of variation of modern males. The inference is that outlet circumference in Neandertal females is also small in size, but within the range of variation of modern females. Arguments that Neandertal newborns were larger in size than those of modern humans necessarily imply that birth was more difficult in Neandertals. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

The resulting new reconstruction of the Le Moustier 1 skull shows morphologic features close to the typical Neanderthal adult state.

To visualize complex patterns of shape change, we propose an alternative to classical Cartesian deformation grids in the style of D'Arcy W. Thompson. Reference to the surface structures of the organism under investigation permits a comprehensive visual grasp of shape change and its tentative interpretation in terms of differential growth. The application of this method to the analysis of human craniofacial shape variation reveals distinct modes of growth and development of the neurocranial and viscerocranial regions of the skull. Our data further indicate that variations in the orientation of the viscerocranium relative to the neurocranium impinge on the shapes of the face and the cranial vault.","Allometry; Cranial development; Geometric morphometrics; Growth; Homo sapiens; Symmetry","cranium; allometry; analytic method; article; covariance; craniofacial development; genetic variability; geometry; human; human tissue; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; orientation; pattern recognition; priority journal; skull development; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Cephalometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Anatomic; Skull; Homo; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41049095771

We hypothesize that the underlying scale which determines the presence or absence of a cranial non‐metric trait is an expression of general and/or local size variation in the cranium. Therefore metric and non‐metric traits will share a common developmental determination. The hypothesis implies that the underlying scale of a non‐metric trait will be correlated with measures of cranial size and shape. Forty‐eight cranial metric and twenty‐five cranial non‐metric traits were scored on the left side of adult male crania from four North American Indian populations. New threshold traits were generated for each non‐metric trait by dichotomizing discriminant scores produced by discriminant function analysis. The discriminant analysis was performed using metric traits to discriminate between groups formed by non‐metric trait presence or absence. Every non‐metric trait tested was significantly correlated with its threshold trait in at least one population. The correlations were of moderate to high levels depending on the trait and population sample studied. This implies that metric and non‐metric traits share a moderate to high degree of developmental determination. The cause of these correlations may lie in the common effects that growth and development of the soft tissue and functional spaces of the cranium exert on both metric and non‐metric traits.

J. Phys. Anthropol. 7:401-424) presented a conundrum: among primates, sexual dimorphism of the pelvis is a developmental adjunct to dimorphism in other aspects of the body, albeit in the converse direction. Among species in which males are larger than females in body size, females are larger than males in some pelvic dimensions; species with little sexual dimorphism in nonpelvic size show little pelvic dimorphism. Obstetrical difficulty does not explain this relationship. The present study addresses this issue, evaluating the relationship between pelvic and femoral sexual dimorphism in 12 anthropoid species. The hypothesis is that species in which males are significantly larger than females in femoral size will have a higher incidence, magnitude, and variability of pelvic sexual dimorphism, with females having relatively larger pelves than males, compared with species monomorphic in femoral size. The results are consistent with the hypothesis. The proposed explanation is that the default pelvic anatomy in adulthood is that of the female; testosterone redirects growth from the default type to that of the male by differentially enhancing and repressing growth among the pelvic dimensions. Testosterone also influences sexual dimorphism of the femur. The magnitude of the pelvic response to testosterone is greater in species that are sexually dimorphic in the femur than in those that are monomorphic. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Obstetrics; Pelvis; Primate; Sexual dimorphism; Testosterone; Variability","testosterone; article; body mass; female; femur head; male; measurement; nonhuman; pelvis; primate; sex difference; species differentiation; Animals; Anthropometry; Body Size; Female; Femur; Male; Pelvic Bones; Primates; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-22544478437

The presence of such a difference is integral to some models on the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Several studies report that males are more variable than females for nonpelvic measures. This study tests for a sexual difference in variability of the pelvis. Phenotypic variance is a correlate of both the intensity and mode of selection. In both sexes, the pelvis is subject primarily to stabilizing selection. However, selection intensity is greater among females than among males because only among females does the pelvis function as a birth canal and, thereby, serve as a proximate cause of death. As selection intensity and phenotypic variability are inversely related under stabilizing selection, the implication is that females should be less variable than males in pelvic size and shape. However, the results of previous studies on this issue are equivocal or contradictory. This study compares the sexes for differences in pelvic variability by analyzing nine species (and ten samples) of nonhuman anthropoids. Data were collected on 16 measures of the pelvis; only adults were used. Levene's univariate and multivariate tests for relative variation were used in the analysis. The results show that the sexes do not differ significantly in pelvic variability either within or among the nine samples of noncaptive anthropoids. Only in the one sample of captive specimens (Saimiri sciureus) do the sexes differ significantly in pelvic variability, with males being more variable than females. Two interpretations are derived from these results. First, the sexual difference in variability in captive Saimiri may be due either to a bias in the selection of Saimiri specimens by the captors/experimentors or to a sexual difference in growth associated with the stress of captivity. Second, the sexes do not differ in pelvic variability among noncaptive anthropoids because the anlage of the pelvis is bipotential in development. The intrinsic (i.e., agonadal) pattern of growth and development is that characteristic of a female. Testicular androgens are requisite to redirect the pattern of growth and development to that characteristic of a male. However, the redirected pattern of growth in males simply shifts en masse the intrinsic (i.e., female) distribution curve. The consequence among adults is sexual dimorphism in pelvic size, but sexual equivalency in relative pelvic variability. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Dwarfism is the most obvious skeletal manifestation, but most people with hypothyroidism do not have any skeletal evidence of the disease. When the skeleton is affected, the severity of this manifestation depends on the degree of the deficiency and age of onset. Endemic hypothyroidism typically is linked to specific ecological settings such as the high mountains where iodine is absent, or else it occurs with very low concentrations in water and soil. In these areas, the prevalence may be as high as 8%. The disease can be expected to occur in archaeological human skeletal samples from endemic regions. Sporadic hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency in the thyroid gland itself, and is not linked to any specific environmental context. The disease may be the result of a genetic defect, but can also be caused by other pathological conditions that may affect the thyroid gland, including infection and cancer. The skeletal abnormalities of the two variants will be indistinguishable in archaeological human remains. In order to identify hypothyroidism in archaeological skeletal samples, one must be aware of the differences in pathological skeletal changes seen in hypothyroidism in comparison with other diseases, such as achondroplasia, that can cause similar abnormalities. Twelve clinically documented cases of hypothyroidism provide data for understanding the skeletal abnormalities associated with this disease. All 12 are modern documented cases from Switzerland, where endemic hypothyroidism occurred in the iodine-deficient Alpine regions. However, at least one case in the sample was caused by a defect in the thyroid gland itself.","Cretinism; Dwarfism; Endocrine diseases","water; achondroplasia; adult; aged; article; concentration (parameters); data analysis; disease association; disease severity; dwarfism; environmental factor; female; genetics; hormone synthesis; human; human tissue; hypothyroidism; infection complication; iodine deficiency; male; onset age; prevalence; skeleton malformation; soil; Switzerland; thyroid cancer; thyroid function; Anthropometry; Bone and Bones; Environment; Humans; Hypothyroidism; Switzerland",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17244363758

In a previous study of patients with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), we identified cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) mutations in only 36% of cases and suspected that the low-mutation detection rate was partially due to misdiagnosis. We therefore instituted a clinical-radiographic review system, whereby all cases were evaluated by a panel of skeletal dysplasia experts (European Skeletal Dysplasia Network). Only those patients in whom the diagnosis of MED was confirmed by the panel were screened for mutations. Under this regimen the mutation detection rate increased to 81%. When clinical-radiological diagnostic criteria were relaxed the mutation rate dropped to 67%. We conclude that expert clinical-radiological review can significantly enhance mutation detection rates and should be part of any diagnostic mutation screening protocol for skeletal dysplasias.",,"cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; adult; article; bone dysplasia; bone radiography; child; clinical article; clinical assessment; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic error; epiphysis disease; female; gene identification; gene mutation; genetic code; genetic screening; human; image analysis; male; medical expert; mutational analysis; practice guideline; priority journal; Adult; Child, Preschool; DNA Mutational Analysis; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Female; Genetic Screening; Glycoproteins; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Osteochondrodysplasias",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846301707

However, on dry bones, the morphology of the cartilaginous tissues that form the two sacroiliac joints and the pubic symphysis before death remains unknown, leading to potential inaccuracies and errors during the reassembly process. A protocol was established to investigate the effects of reassembly on the quantification of pelvis shape. The shape of fresh pelves obtained after dissection, in which the three bones are in an anatomically relevant position, was compared with the shape of different reassemblies based on the individual dry bones of the same individuals. Our results demonstrated a significant effect of the reassembly. Variation in the reassembly process is likely related, first, to the complete absence of cartilaginous tissues on dry bones and, second, to the morphology of the sacroiliac joint which, in vivo, allows physiological movements, resulting in different potential positions of the two sacroiliac surfaces relative to one another. However, the artificial variation introduced by the reassembly process appears small compared with the biological variation between the different individuals. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","hip bone; measurement precision; morphometrics; nutation","adult; aged; anatomical variation; article; cartilaginous tissue; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; in vivo study; male; movement (physiology); pelvic girdle; sacroiliac joint; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Biomechanics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pelvic Bones; Pelvis; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859918870

Here we report on a 6-generation MED family with 17 affected members. Method The clinical and radiographic data on the 12 affected members still living were scrutinized. A structured inquiry comprising state of health and MED-related symptoms since birth up to the present time and the osteoarthritis outcome (KOOS) questionnaire were sent to all living family members with MED. The 5 known gene loci for autosomal dominant MED were analyzed for linkage, using fluorescence-labeled microsatellite markers. Linkage was ascertained with markers close to the COL9A2 gene, which was analyzed for mutations by sequencing. Results We identified an exon 3 donor splice mutation in the COL9A2 gene in all affected family members. Clinical, radiographic, and questionnaire data from affected family members suggested that MED caused by COL9A2 mutations starts in early childhood with knee pain accompanied by delayed ossification of femoral epiphyses. The disease then either stabilizes during puberty or progresses with additional joints becoming affected; joint surgery might be necessary. The progression of the disease also affects muscles, with increasing atrophy, resulting in muscle fatigue and pain. Muscular atrophy has not been reported earlier in cases with COL9A2 mutations. Interpretation In a patient with clinically suspected or verified MED, it is important to perform DNA-based analysis to identify a possible disease-causing mutation. This information can be used to carry out genetic risk assessment of other family members and to achieve an early and correct diagnosis in the children. © Nordic Orthopedic Federation.",,"adult; aged; article; autosomal dominant inheritance; bone dysplasia; bone radiography; clinical article; clinical feature; COL9A2 gene; female; gene; genetic analysis; genotype; human; knee pain; linkage analysis; male; multiple epiphyseal dysplasia; muscle atrophy; muscle fatigue; mutational analysis; myalgia; osteoarthritis; pedigree; questionnaire; short stature; Sweden; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Collagen Type IX; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Linkage (Genetics); Male; Middle Aged; Osteochondrodysplasias; Pedigree; Questionnaires; Sweden; Young Adult",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-72549110681

Seven cases of acetabular non-unions are reported in this retrospective study. Five out of our seven patients had either transverse or associated transverse with posterior wall fractures. All patients had surgical stabilisation of their index fractures. A diagnosis of non-union was made at an average of 5.8 months from the original injury based on clinical and radiological features. Five of the six patients who underwent re-stabilisation and bone grafting of the non-union healed where as the remaining one did not heal after two attempts at re-stabilisation and was treated with excision arthroplasty. Two of the healed five, subsequently developed osteoarthritis and had total hip arthroplasty where as one patient had already developed degeneration of his hip at the time of diagnosis and hence treated with total hip arthroplasty. Analysis of the non-unions confirmed that fixation was unstable in all with residual displacement seen in two of them.
