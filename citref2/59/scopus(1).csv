As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

Here we present records of sea surface temperature from North Atlantic sediments spanning the past 90 kyr which contain a series of rapid temperature oscillations closely matching those in the ice-core record, confirming predictions that the ocean must bear the imprint of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events2,3. Moreover, we show that between 20 and 80 kyr ago, the shifts in ocean-atmosphere temperature are bundled into cooling cycles, lasting on average 10 to 15 kyr, with asymmetrical saw-tooth shapes. Each cycle culminated in an enormous discharge of icebergs into the North Atlantic (a 'Hein-rich event'4,5), followed by an abrupt shift to a warmer climate. These cycles document a previously unrecognized link between ice sheet behaviour and ocean-atmosphere temperature changes. An important question that remains to be resolved is whether the cycles are driven by external factors, such as orbital forcing, or by inter-nal ice-sheet dynamics. © 1993 Nature Publishing Group.",,"climate record; correlation; Dansgaard-Oeschger event; ice core record; oxygen isotope measurement; palaeoclimate; sea surface temperature; sediment; sediment record; Atlantic, (North); Greenland; Greenland, Summit",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027845692

Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3-5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackfish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.","Arctic charr; Atlantic salmon; Brown trout; Cannibalism; Feeding; Freshwater residence; Habitat; Life history; Migration; Phenotypic plasticity; Phylogeography; Polymorphism; Research challenges","life history; phenotype; phenotypic plasticity; salmonid; Impleta; Insecta; Oncorhynchus; Salmo; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae; Salmoninae; Salvelinus; Salvelinus alpinus; Salvelinus fontinalis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037334986

The expected climate change in the Atlantic is for milder and wetter winters, with more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow, decrease in ice-covered periods and frequent periods with extreme weather. Overall, thermal limits for salmonids are species specific. Scope for activity and growth and optimal temperature for growth increase with temperature to an optimal point before constrain by the oxygen content of the water. The optimal temperature for growth decreases with increasing fish size and varies little among populations within species, whereas the growth efficiency may be locally adapted to the temperature conditions of the home stream during the growth season. Indirectly, temperature influences age and size at smolting through its effect on growth. Time of spawning, egg hatching and emergence of the larvae vary with temperature and selective effects on time of first feeding. Traits such as age at first maturity, longevity and fecundity decrease with increasing temperature whilst egg size increases with temperature. Water flow influences the accessibility of rivers for returning adults and speed of both upstream and downstream migration. Extremes in water flow and temperature can decrease recruitment and survival. There is reason to expect a northward movement of the thermal niche of anadromous salmonids with decreased production and population extinction in the southern part of the distribution areas, migrations earlier in the season, later spawning, younger age at smolting and sexual maturity and increased disease susceptibility and mortality. Future research challenges are summarized at the end of the paper. © 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.","Activity; Climate; Embryonic development; Growth; Life-history traits; Migration","adaptation; animal; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic salmon; climate change; growth, development and aging; physiology; population migration; prenatal development; reproduction; review; species difference; temperature; trout; water flow; Adaptation, Physiological; Animal Migration; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Climate Change; Reproduction; Salmo salar; Species Specificity; Temperature; Trout; Water Movements; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-75149198659

As water temperature increases as a result of climate change, quantitative information on the thermal requirements of these three species is essential so that potential problems can be anticipated by those responsible for the conservation and sustainable management of the fisheries and the maintenance of biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems. Part I compares the temperature limits for survival, feeding and growth. Salmo salar has the highest temperature tolerance, followed by S. trutta and finally S. alpinus. For all three species, the temperature tolerance for alevins is slightly lower than that for parr and smolts, and the eggs have the lowest tolerance; this being the most vulnerable life stage to any temperature increase, especially for eggs of S. alpinus in shallow water. There was little evidence to support local thermal adaptation, except in very cold rivers (mean annual temperature <6.5° C). Part II illustrates the importance of developing predictive models, using data from a long-term study (1967-2000) of a juvenile anadromous S. trutta population. Individual-based models predicted the emergence period for the fry. Mean values over 34 years revealed a large variation in the timing of emergence with c. 2 months between extreme values. The emergence time correlated significantly with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, indicating that interannual variations in emergence were linked to more general changes in climate. Mean stream temperatures increased significantly in winter and spring at a rate of 0.37° C per decade, but not in summer and autumn, and led to an increase in the mean mass of pre-smolts. A growth model for S. trutta was validated by growth data from the long-term study and predicted growth under possible future conditions. Small increases (<2.5° C) in winter and spring would be beneficial for growth with 1 year-old smolts being more common. Water temperatures would have to increase by c. 4° C in winter and spring, and 3° C in summer and autumn before they had a marked negative effect on trout growth. © 2010 The Authors.

While empirical documentation of salmon storage is certainly important, a variety of noncultural factors, particularly bone density, should be considered in interpreting body part frequencies. Bone densities of representative cranial and postcranial elements from 10 chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were measured using X-ray absorptiometry. Except for the otolith, most cranial elements have lower densities than postcranial bones. The role of bone density in structuring prehistoric salmon assemblages is explored through comparisons of density measures with element survivorships in three archaeological assemblages with low cranial element survivorship. The scarcity of cranial elements in two of the assemblages is best explained by density-mediated destruction, while cultural processing probably accounts for the dearth of head bones in the third assemblage. © 1994 Academic Press Limited.","Bone volume; Fish butchering; North-western North America; Prehistoric salmon; Salmon bone density; Salmon storage; Salmon taphonomy; X-ray absorptiometry",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000070235

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

The method was used on more than 20 salmon bone samples (dated 7000 to 2000 BP) from the site of Namu on the central coast of British Columbia. Four species: coho, sockeye, pink and chum salmon were identified from the samples. The results are considered valid since systematic contaminations were not detected, multiple species and multiple DNA haplotypes of the same species were identified from the same set of bone samples, and the identified species are consistent with those inferred from other lines of evidence.

Periodic salmon shortages in the period after 2000 cal B.C., which are associated with local and regional disruptions in settlement and increased reliance on more marginal resources, appear to be the result of failures in the pink salmon fishery.

Garivaldino presents a range of dates from 11,660 to 7540calBP. Multivariate statistics applied to both traditional and geometric morphometric analyses failed to reveal any important changes in shape through time. However, the coefficients of variation presented a significant increase through time in three measurements related to projectile point neck and stem. The absence of change in shape might be related to small group size and low level of cultural innovation. Such cultural stability might be related to novelty-avoiding mechanisms or the operation of a meta-tradition that would be selected in very stable environments. On the other hand, the increase in the variation of linear measurements through time might suggest an increase in population size and copying errors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bifacial stemmed points; Brazilian archaeology; Cultural transmission; Garivaldino Rodrigues; Geometric morphometrics; Meta-tradition","archaeology; cultural history; cultural tradition; hunter-gatherer; morphometry; multivariate analysis; population size; Brazil; Rio Grande do Sul",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895755843

We tested this model using the dental phenotype of modern and ancient common voles (Microtus arvalis), introduced onto the Orkney archipelago (Scotland) from continental Europe some 5000 years ago. First, we investigated phenotypic divergence of Orkney and continental European populations and assessed climatic influences. Second, phenotypic differentiation among Orkney populations was tested against geography, time, and neutral genetic patterns. Finally, we examined evolutionary change along a time series for the Orkney Mainland. Molar gigantism and anterior-lobe hypertrophy evolved rapidly in Orkney voles following introduction, without any transitional forms detected. Founder events and adaptation appear to explain this initial rapid evolution. Idiosyncrasy in dental features among different island populations of Orkney voles is also likely the result of local founder events following Neolithic translocation around the archipelago. However, against our initial expectations, a second marked phenotypic shift occurred between the 4th and 12th centuries AD, associated with increased pastoral farming and introduction of competitors (mice and rats) and terrestrial predators (foxes and cats). These results indicate that human agency can generate a more complex pattern of morphological evolution than might be expected in island rodents. © 2014 The Authors.","Dispersal; Evolutionary rate; Geometric morphometrics; Island evolution; Tooth shape; Zooarchaeology","adaptation; divergence; ecological modeling; geometry; morphology; morphometry; Neolithic; population structure; rodent; Europe; Mainland [Shetland]; Scotland; Shetland; United Kingdom; Microtus arvalis orcadensis; Muridae; adaptation; anatomy and histology; animal; Arvicolinae; biological model; climate; ecosystem; Europe; founder effect; genetic variability; genetics; island (geological); molar tooth; molecular evolution; phenotype; population genetics; United Kingdom; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Arvicolinae; Climate; Ecosystem; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Founder Effect; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Islands; Models, Genetic; Molar; Phenotype; Scotland",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908068182

We have shown how an ecological niche model (ENM) based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions of sea surface temperature and bathymetry can be used to effectively predict the spatial range of marine fish during the LGM. The results indicate that the ranges of marine fish species now in northwestern Europe were displaced significantly southwards from the modern distribution, challenging an existing paradigm of marine glacial refugia. The model presents strong evidence that there was an invasion of important fish through the Straits of Gibraltar in glacial times, where they were exploited by Palaeolithic human populations around the western Mediterranean Sea. The ENM results are important for ongoing studies of molecular ecology that aim to assess marine glacial refugia from the genetic structure of living populations, and they pose questions about the genetic identity of vanished marine populations during the LGM.

Although modularity of the mandible and skull has been studied extensively in mammals, few studies have explored shape co-variation between these two structures. Despite being developmentally independent, the skull and mandible form a functionally integrated unit. In the present paper we use 3D surface geometric morphometric methods allowing us to explore the form of both skull and mandible in its 3D complexity using the greater white-toothed shrew as a model. This approach allows an accurate 3D description of zones devoid of anatomical landmarks that are functionally important. Two-block partial least-squares approaches were used to describe the co-variation of form between skull and mandible. Moreover, a 3D biomechanical model was used to explore the functional consequences of the observed patterns of co-variation. Our results show the efficiency of the method in investigations of complex morpho-functional patterns. Indeed, the description of shape co-variation between the skull and the mandible highlighted the location and the intensity of their functional relationships through the jaw adductor muscles linking these two structures. Our results also demonstrated that shape co-variation in form between the skull and mandible has direct functional consequences on the recruitment of muscles during biting. © 2013 Anatomical Society.","Biting; Geometric morphometrics; Muscle; Shrews; Surface shape","anatomical variation; animal experiment; article; biomechanics; bite; functional anatomy; geometry; jaw adductor muscle; jaw movement; jaw muscle; mandible; molar tooth; morphometrics; nonhuman; priority journal; skull; three dimensional imaging; tooth; Crocidura; Mammalia; Soricidae; biting; geometric morphometrics; muscle; shrews; surface shape; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mandible; Mastication; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological; Shrews; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884207131

Today, more than 120 years after Schaaffhausen's initial excavation, two large Magdalenian sites - Andernach and Gönnersdorf - as well as six Federmesser sites are known from the Central Rhineland. The latter are Andernach (upper find horizon), Boppard, Niederbieber (the most extensive of these sites), Kettig and Urbar, all of which pre-date the Laacher See eruption, and Bad Breisig, post-dating this event. Furthermore, repeated discoveries of isolated hearths show human activities in the Allerød landscape away from the larger encampments. The archaeological record provides detailed insight into both the environment and life of the Central Rhineland Magdalenian and Federmesser groups and their material culture. The changes in environment and available subsistence resources between the Magdalenian and Federmesser groups were accompanied by radical shifts in material technology, the internal spatial organisation of settlements and the manifestation of artistic expression. By contrast with these well-defined groups, the ""cultures"" intermediate between the Magdalenian hunter-gatherers of the open loess steppe and the Federmesser groups of the interstadial woodlands are scarcely known. The only evidence for this interval comes from the southwestern part of the Gönnersdorf site and from the burials at Bonn-Oberkassel and Neuwied-Irlich.",,,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349097738

Previous archaeological studies indicate that economic stratification within the community might have resulted in differential access to some preferred salmon species, such as sockeye and chinook. Unambiguous ancient DNA species identification now makes it possible to more accurately address the issue of early salmon resource utilization in the region. This study analyzed 60 salmon remains from two specialized structures and two residential structures in order to identify any species differences among bony salmon remains found within the structure. Although high success rates (over 90%) were obtained for ancient DNA tests, only three species (chinook, sockeye and coho salmon) were identified from the remains. Pink salmon was not identified among the tested sample, despite the fact that it was originally assumed to be a staple species for the site's native inhabitants. The absence of pink salmon in our sample significantly altered the picture of early salmon fishing activities in the region. As a result, the effects of economic stratification on differential access to the remaining so-called preferred species of sockeye and chinook within the four structures studied were not as dramatic as previously thought, although differences among the structures could still be observed. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Although DNA recovered from ancient salmonid remains can be analyzed to identify species, relatively few investigators have used this technique, probably because of its associated cost. The Huber etal. (2011) morphometric method uses vertebral length, height, and the ratio of length to height to provide a relatively simple, rapid, and non-destructive way to identify the species of salmon and trout vertebrae. From the Coffman Cove site in Alaska (49-PET-067), 731 vertebrae were measured and classified using the Huber etal. (2011) morphometric method. The Type II vertebrae (n=312) were classified as 47% pink salmon, 39% sockeye, 8% steelhead, with lower percentages of chum, coho, and Chinook salmon. Type III vertebrae (n=419) were classified as 62% pink salmon, 28% sockeye, 3% coho, 3% steelhead, and 3% cutthroat, with minor quantities of chum and Chinook salmon. Because the results from classifying Type II vertebrae were significantly different than from classifying Type III vertebrae, we questioned the reliability of the method. In a blind test of 56 of these samples, molecular species identification was possible for 37 of them, indicating fair preservation of ancient DNA (aDNA) in Coffman Cove salmonid bones. Genetic identifications agree with species classifications using the Huber etal. method about 57% of the time; a goodness of fit test shows the success of the method is significantly different from random for pink salmon but for coho, chum, and sockeye salmon, the results were the same as if species had been assigned randomly. Although the sample of bones analyzed using aDNA is smaller than that analyzed using the morphometric method, it is large enough to estimate that pink salmon made up 70% of the assemblage at Coffman Cove, followed by coho (16%), chum (11%), and sockeye (3%). The morphometric method seems to mis-classify pink salmon from Coffman Cove as sockeye. Chinook salmon, steelhead, and cutthroat salmon were not identified using aDNA, although they might be identified in a larger sample. Molecular species identification via aDNA analysis remains the most accurate method of identifying salmon vertebrae to species, at least until the morphometric method is refined. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ancient DNA; Genetic species identification; Northwest Coast; PCR inhibitors; Salmonid morphometrics; Tlingit","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; DNA; genetic analysis; genetic structure; identification method; inhibitor; morphometry; polymerase chain reaction; salmonid; skeletal remains; Alaska; United States; Coffman Cove; Amadina fasciata; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oncorhynchus nerka; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Salmonidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887367227

The biometrical study of length, height and width of the successive vertebrae constituting the vertebral axis of the eel (Anguilla anguilla), the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), the skipjack (Trachurus trachurus) and the bonite (Sarda orientalis) allows us to confirm that the axial skeleton shows a morpho-anatomical regionalization more complicated than the classical division in truncal and caudal parts only. With the morphological data reported here, it is possible to define four vertebral profiles that are different and characteristic of the four groups of axial swimming: anguilliform, subcarangiform, carangiform, and thunniform swimming (respectively exemplified by the eel, trout, skipjack and tuna). The relative rank of the maximal vertebral length, height and width according to body length of the fishes is characteristic of the axial swimming groups; close to the head in the anguilliform group, it is localized near the middle of the vertebral axis in the subcarangiform one and very posteriorly in the two last ones (carangiform and thunniform) that look relatively similar.

We developed a relatively simple, rapid, and non-destructive way to classify salmon and trout vertebrae from archaeological contexts to species using length, height and the ratio of length to height. Modern reference material was obtained from all seven anadromous Oncorhynchus species native to the west coast of North America. A minimum of ten adult Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), chum (Oncorhynchus keta), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and cutthroat (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were skeletonized and vertebra length and height were measured. Morphometric analyses compared species classification success based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and randomForest, with CART performing the best. Classification analyses used all seven species individually, but because of considerable overlap among several species we also conducted analyses on four species groupings. We assigned Chinook salmon and cutthroat to their own groups based on their dissimilarities from each other and the other species. The remaining species were divided into two group complexes (a) chum, coho, and steelhead; and (b) pink and sockeye. When we grouped species according to similar morphology, CART overall success rates increased, ranging from 92 to 100%. Individual species with the highest successful classification rates using CART were Chinook salmon and cutthroat, from 92 to 100%, respectively. We applied our classification to an assemblage of ancient (1000-3000 year old) salmonid vertebrae from the Swiftwater Rockshelters excavations on the upper Wenatchee River in Washington State, U.S.A. © 2010.","CART; Classification and regression trees; Salmonid morphometrics; Vertebrae","archaeology; classification; excavation; fossil assemblage; morphology; morphometry; regression analysis; salmonid; skeletal remains; Alaska; California; United States; Washington [United States]; Wenatchee River; Amadina fasciata; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii; Oncorhynchus gorbuscha; Oncorhynchus keta; Oncorhynchus kisutch; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oncorhynchus nerka; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha; Salmonidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049231822

However, identification of domestic morphotypes have been complicated by the low variation in equid cranial morphology and apparent limited changes brought about through the domestication process compared with other domestic taxa. Furthermore, cranial morphology is too prone to ecophenotypic plasticity to provide relevant taxonomic markers. Even dental morphology (of primary importance for taxonomic investigation in the fossil record) has been dismissed as a useful marker for horse domestication, since variations in tooth size and enamel patterns are considered to be too greatly influenced by age and continuous tooth wear. The proof-of-concept study presented here re-evaluates the potential of cheek teeth shape to capture significant differences between horse populations. Using geometric morphometrics (GMM), we study the enamel-folding pattern of the upper P2 and M3, selected for their distinctive morphology amongst the cheek teeth. Curated specimens of known age and sex from two horse (Equus caballus) breeds - Icelandic and Thoroughbred - were used to investigate whether the effects of age (through occlusal wear), sexual dimorphism and allometry (size-related change in shape) should be regarded as confounding factors preventing any accurate discrimination between these two populations. The results show that a landmark based approach applied to the occlusal enamel folding of the P2 and M3 captures significant differences in size (centroïd) and shape between the horses breeds studied. Age-related factors, allometric scaling and sexual dimorphism are not confounding factors in their discrimination, encouraging the use of dental form in population-based research on ancient horse remains. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Age effect; Equus caballus; Population discrimination; Sexual dimorphism; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","archaeological evidence; archaeology; domestication; horse; morphometry; morphotype; paleontology; phenotype; sexual dimorphism; tooth; cranium; fossil record; geometry; Animalia; Equidae; Equus caballus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888044212

Species confined between various barriers (Atlas Mountains, arid environments such as the Sahara in the south, water masses such as the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west) were generally forced to adapt locally to environmental changes instead of tracking their habitat by shifting their distribution area. The present study aims at providing first insight into the evolution of the genus Mus, and more specifically of the western Mediterranean species Mus spretus in this area. The study relies on the abundant Late Pleistocene and Middle Holocene fossil assemblage from the El Harhoura 2 cave (Rabat-Témara, Morocco). This exceptional record was studied using geometric morphometrics applied to first upper and lower molars, constituting the most informative and best preserved fossil remains for such small rodents. Two main issues were addressed. (1) Geometric morphometrics was used to clarify taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships among fossil and modern species in this area. Morphometric analysis revealed good discrimination of most modern and fossil species but failed to document intermediate forms tracing anagenetic evolution. Not mutually exclusive, the occurrence of complex processes of morphological evolution in this genus such as parallel evolution and the action of stabilizing selection may make it difficult to translate patterns of morphological evolution into phylogenetic conclusions. (2) The record was shown to document a sequence of intraspecific evolution of M.spretus. The morphology of the molars through the fossil record of El Harhoura 2 was surprisingly stable despite extensive modern variation. The limited temporal variation largely failed to correlate to palaeoenvironmental proxies. The mouse fossil record at El Harhoura 2 thus presents an intriguing case of morphological stasis despite extensive environmental changes. This long-term stability may have been recently perturbed by anthropogenic factors including landscape changes and introduction of various competitors and predators, leading to a size reduction.© 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 599-621. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.","Elliptic Fourier Analysis of outlines; First upper and lower molars; Geometric morphometrics; Holocene; Morocco; Murinae, Rodentia; Pleistocene","anthropogenic effect; arid environment; biogeographical region; fossil assemblage; fossil record; geometry; Holocene; immigration; morphology; morphometry; paleoenvironment; phylogenetics; phylogeny; Pleistocene; rodent; tropical region; Atlantic Ocean; Atlas Mountains; Mediterranean Sea; Morocco; Sahara; Murinae; Mus spretus; Rodentia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879267101

Therefore, identifying temporal changes in life history traits over large timescales is necessary to understand and predict the effect of current global change on wild populations. In this study, we compare life history traits between Palaeolithic and present-day vertebrates, analysing the number of winters spent in the river and at sea by North Iberian salmonids (Salmo salar and Salmo trutta) from two separate time frames: the Upper Palaeolithic, based on archaeological remains, and the present day, based on sport catches. The river stage did not change significantly, but the marine period has been shortened in modern anadromous specimens, accordingly shortening mean generation time. Population growth rates have been estimated through Bayesian analyses of the mitochondrial DNA control region of modern specimens for the two Salmo species using two different mutation rates (1% and 3.6%). Coincidence of coalescent N e estimates with independent N e calculated from catches suggests that the 3.6% mutation rate fits better the evolution of the studied populations. Population growth rate declines would have occurred in the last millennium and could be explained by a combination of climatic events and anthropogenic activities. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","archaeological remains; bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees; demographic trends; life history; Salmo; Upper Palaeolithic","mitochondrial DNA; adaptation; animal; article; Atlantic salmon; Bayes theorem; evolution; genetics; molecular genetics; mutation rate; nucleotide sequence; physiology; population density; Spain; trout; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Biological Evolution; DNA, Mitochondrial; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation Rate; Population Density; Salmo salar; Spain; Trout; Salmo; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860529370

Consequently, they are poorly studied, even if they could possess species-specific information. Here, we use mandibles of white-toothed shrews and a taphonomic pattern of fragmentation composed of seven pieces to test their validity in species assignment. Using an extant non-ambiguous reference sample of five species, we explore the specific assignments of fragments obtained by a k-NN method of classification, artificially derived from the complete mandible. To describe the form of each piece we use 2D anatomical landmarks and sliding semilandmarks that allow the quantification of objects with no or few true anatomical landmarks. Results show that small fragments still possess species-specific information that is nearly always enhanced when using sliding-landmarks. Moreover, morpho-functional aspects are detected that can affect the species-specific information contained in the fragments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeozoology; Geometric morphometrics; Mammals; Species identification; Taphonomy","anatomy; archaeology; fragmentation; mammal; morphometry; taphonomy; zoology; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911059124

Thus, the ability to gain access to resources not available to other individuals and species should be under strong selection. In the present study, we focus on the potential role of biting in a shrew (Crocidura russula) because this trait may confer two advantages: (1) a broadening of the dietary niche and (2) the provision of direct superiority in interspecific interactions. The model chosen is the greater white-toothed shrew, which is considered as invasive in northern Europe and which is also known to displace native species of shrew in this area. Moreover, its distribution appears to constrain the distributional ranges of other species of shrew in the Maghreb. We use geometric morphometrics and a simple biomechanical model to describe shape variation and to evaluate the mechanical potential of the mandible of ten species of white-toothed shrews, with a special emphasis on C. russula and Crocidura suaveolens. We find that C. russula possesses an intermediate mechanical potential linked with an intermediate level of shape variability. Our results suggest that the higher mechanical potential may explain the observed pattern of colonization of the Atlantic islands by C. russula at the expense of C.suaveolens. Finally, our results also suggest that the ability to bite hard may be under strong selection in shrews. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.","Crocidura; Feeding system; Islands; Mammals; Mechanical potential; Shape","biomechanics; colonization; life history trait; morphometry; native species; natural selection; niche breadth; rodent; shape; Atlantic islands; Maghreb; Crocidura; Crocidura russula; Crocidura suaveolens; Mammalia; Soricidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924540595

Ledeganckstraat 35, Gent, B-9000, Belgium","The El Harhoura 2 cave (Morocco) presents a high density of white-toothed shrew (Crocidurinae) remains in the eight studied archaeological levels, ranging from around 108,000 to 5800 BP. A detailed understanding of the species contained in these assemblages is important for palaeoecological studies, yet often difficult to achieve because the remains are systematically broken. Here we apply geometric morphometric methods that use sliding landmarks allowing us to assign broken mandibles to five potential species present in Morocco today. Four species were detected, with a distinct distribution in the different levels. Surprisingly, Crocidura russula, a species typically associated with relatively humid habitats, was found to be more abundant in periods characterized by dry conditions. Moreover, the abundance of the Saharan species Crocidura tarfayensis and Crocidura lusitania followed an inverse pattern. Both groups appear to affect each other's abundance throughout the studied period. We suggest that the coastal position of El Harhoura 2 as well as the inter-specific competition between C. russula and other species may explain this pattern. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Fragmentation; Mandible; Palaeoecology; Shrews; Species identification; Taphonomy","archaeological evidence; fossil assemblage; identification key; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; small mammal; specimen bank; taphonomy; abundance; interspecific competition; morphometry; rodent; Morocco; Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer; Temara; Crocidura; Crocidura lusitania; Crocidura russula; Crocidurinae; Soricidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936748603
