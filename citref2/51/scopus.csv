Population and maritime industries has incremented pollution in Nuevo gulf harbor since 1970s, promoting morphological changes in B. globulosus shell shape. We study the shell shape of the species comparing present day's specimens from the harbor zone with those collected in the same zone before the increasing of maritime activity and pre-Hispanic archaeological Middens. We demonstrated that harbor pollution produces globular shell shape in B. globulosus, an effect that probably allows gastropods to isolate themselves from the external adverse environment. On the contrary, shells from pre-Hispanic periods, unpolluted sites and those collected before the expansion of maritime activities, presented an elongated shell shape. Our study confirms that shell shape variation in marine gastropods can be used as a biomarker of harbor pollution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Gastropod shell; Geometric morphometrics; Harbor pollution; Patagonia","Biomarkers; Molluscs; Shells (structures); Adverse environment; Gastropod shell; Geometric morphometrics; Maritime activities; Maritime industry; Morphological changes; Patagonia; Shape variations; Marine pollution; biomarker; gastropod; marine pollution; morphology; morphometry; shell; animal behavior; animal shell; archeology; Article; Buccinanops globulosus; controlled study; environmental impact; gastropod; Hispanic; history; human activities; marine environment; morphology; nonhuman; sea pollution; shell shape; water pollution indicator; analysis; animal; Argentina; body size; drug effects; environmental monitoring; gastropod; growth, development and aging; physiology; procedures; reproduction; toxicity; water pollutant; Atlantic Ocean; Nuevo Gulf; Patagonia; Gastropoda; biological marker; organotin compound; water pollutant; Animals; Argentina; Biomarkers; Body Size; Environmental Monitoring; Gastropoda; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Reproduction; Trialkyltin Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006784998
