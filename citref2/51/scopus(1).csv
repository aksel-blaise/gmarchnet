Three stages are recognized: an early stage involving the formation of a vas deferens and a small penis, an intermediate stage characterized by the enlargement of the female penis to a size approaching that of the male and a late stage during which the female opening (vulva) is occluded by overgrowth of vas deferens tissue. This blockage of the pallial oviduct prevents the release of egg capsules and renders the female sterile. The extent and cause of such reproductive failure is evident from the high incidence of females containing aborted capsules in declining populations close to sources of tributyltin (TBT) contamination. These same populations comprise fewer females than expected and it would appear that the accumulation of aborted capsules within the pallial oviduct eventually causes the premature death of the female. © 1986, Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

In this first publication, the responses of the freshwater snail Marisa cornuarietis and of the marine prosobranch Nucella lapillus to the xeno-estrogenic model compounds bisphenol A (BPA) and octylphenol (OP) are presented at nominal concentration ranges between 1 and 100 μg/L. Marisa was exposed during 5 months using adult specimens and in a complete life-cycle test for 12 months. In both experiments, the xeno-estrogens induced a complex syndrome of alterations in female Marisa referred to as ""superfemales"" at the lowest concentrations. Affected specimens were characterised by the formation of additional female organs, an enlargement of the accessory pallial sex glands, gross malformations of the pallial oviduct section resulting in an increased female mortality, and a massive stimulation of oocyte and spawning mass production. The effects of BPA and OP were comparable at the same nominal concentrations. An exposure to OP resulted in inverted U-type concentration response relationships for egg and spawning mass production. Adult Nucella from the field were tested for three months in the laboratory. As in Marisa, superfemales with enlarged accessory pallial sex glands and an enhancement of oocyte production were observed. No oviduct malformations were found probably due to species differences in the gross anatomical structure of the pallial oviduct. A lower percentage of exposed specimens had ripe sperm stored in their vesicula seminalis and additionally male Nucella exhibited a reduced length of penis and prostate gland when compared to the control. Because statistically significant effects were observed at the lowest nominal test concentrations (1 μg BPA or OP/L), it can be assumed that even lower concentrations may have a negative impact on the snails. The results show that prosobranchs are sensitive to endocrine disruption at environmentally relevant concentrations and that especially M. cornuarietis is a promising candidate for a future organismic invertebrate model to identify endocrine-mimetic test compounds.","Bisphenol A; Endocrine disruptors; Octylphenol; Snails; Xeno-estrogens","4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; estrogen; octylphenol; phenol derivative; unclassified drug; xenobiotic agent; animal experiment; article; concentration response; controlled study; endocrine function; exposure; female; gonad; life cycle; male; nonhuman; oocyte; oviduct; penis; priority journal; prostate; reproductive toxicity; snail; steroid metabolism; Animals; Estrogens, Non-Steroidal; Female; Fresh Water; Male; Phenols; Seawater; Snails; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034489637

Contrary to expectation, as shown by experimental data at the beginning of organotin chemistry, triorganotins are exceptionally stable in the sediment or in dark places in the deep sea. Since triorganotins do not decompose rapidly in seawater, many incidences of deformities in some shellfish have been linked to their presence, even when present at extremely low concentrations. Alternative tin-free antifoulants containing other biocides, such as copper compounds and organic compounds, have been developed and used since the late 1980s. Some nations have already banned the use of organotin antifouling compounds for small vessels, and in 2001 the International Maritime Organization decided to ban completely the use of the organotin compounds from the year 2003. Therefore, it is necessary to find economically and environmentally better biocidal substances as soon as possible. Moreover, the development of antifoulants containing environmentally safe natural products, fouling release coatings, electroconductive coatings, etc. have long been anticipated from the new point of conservation of the world marine environment.

The actual potency of EDs is low compared to that of natural hormones, but environmental concentrations may still be sufficiently high to produce detrimental biological effects. Most information on the biological effects and mechanisms of action of EDs has been focused on vertebrates. Here we summarize recent progress in studies on selected aspects of endocrine disruption in marine organisms that are still poorly understood and that certainly deserve further research in the near future. This review, divided in four sections, focuses mainly on invertebrates (effects of EDs and mechanisms of action) and presents data on top predators (large pelagic fish and cetaceans), a group of vertebrates that are particularly at risk due to their position in the food chain. The first section deals with basic pathways of steroid biosynthesis and metabolism as a target for endocrine disruption in invertebrates. In the second section, data on the effects and alternative mechanisms of action of estrogenic compounds in mussel immunocytes are presented, addressing to the importance of investigating full range responses to estrogenic chemicals in ecologically relevant invertebrate species. In the third section we review the potential use of vitellogenin (Vtg)-like proteins as a biomarker of endocrine disruption in marine bivalve molluscs, used worldwide as sentinels in marine biomonitoring programmes. Finally, we summarize the results of a recent survey on ED accumulation and effects on marine fish and mammals, utilizing both classical biomarkers of endocrine disruption in vertebrates and non-lethal techniques, such as non-destructive biomarkers, indicating the toxicological risk for top predator species in the Mediterranean. Overall, the reviewed data underline the potential to identify specific types of responses to specific groups of chemicals such as EDs in order to develop suitable biomarkers that could be useful as diagnostic tools for endocrine disruption in marine invertebrates and vertebrates. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

To test this prediction we experimentally compared phenotypic plasticity in two rocky-shore snail species; Littorina saxatilis releasing miniature snails on the shore, and Littorina littorea releasing drifting larvae settling on various shores, expecting L. littorea to show more phenotypic plasticity than L. saxatilis. We compared magnitude and direction of vectors of phenotypic difference in juvenile shell traits after 3 months exposure to different stimuli simulating sheltered and crab-rich shores, or wave-exposed and crab-free shores. Both species showed similar direction and magnitude of vectors of phenotypic difference with minor differences only between ecotypes of the nondispersing species, indicating that plasticity is an evolving trait in L. saxatilis. The lack of a strong plastic response in L. littorea might be explained by limits rather than costs to plasticity. © 2006 The Authors.","Dispersal strategy; Grain size; Littorina littorea; Littorina saxatilis; Local adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity; Rocky shore","ecotype; experimental study; life history; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; plasticity; rocky shore; snail; animal; article; body constitution; Brachyura; ecosystem; genetic selection; genetic variability; genetics; larva; phenotype; snail; Animals; Body Constitution; Brachyura; Ecosystem; Genetic Variation; Larva; Phenotype; Selection (Genetics); Selection, Genetic; Snails; Variation (Genetics); Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Littorina littorea; Littorina saxatilis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750019737

Although most studies concentrated on vertebrate species, invertebrates are now gaining more attention. In particular, data on molluscs is increasing. One of the best-documented and more relevant examples of endocrine disruption is the imposex phenomenon affecting some gastropod species. But the increasing interest is also due to the fact that molluscs, especially bivalves, are good bioindicators used for decades in environmental studies and that progress have been made in the understanding of the physiology and endocrinology of some mollusc species. Recent results suggest that molluscs can be adversely affected by compounds that alter their reproduction and that vertebrate-type sex-steroids metabolism or mechanism of action could be involved in these effects. Nevertheless, the endocrine system of molluscs appears to be dissimilar in many aspects to those of vertebrates and sex-steroids might not have the same importance in all mollusc species. This diversity constitutes an important opportunity to examine and understand new and alternative mechanisms for endocrine disruption. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Prey may respond with an intermediate phenotype that balances the risk from several sources or may simply respond to the most dangerous predator. I examined the separate and combined effects of the presence of shell-breaking (crabs, Cancer productus) and shell-entry (seastars, Pisaster ochraceus) predators fed conspecific snails on the defensive shell morphology and antipredator behavior of a marine snail (Nucella lamellosa). When exposed to each feeding predator separately, snails responded with a combination of morphological defenses that reflect the attack mode of the predator and a generalized behavioral response. Snails responded to feeding crabs by increasing refuge use and producing a thick, rotund shell. Snails responded to feeding seastars with increased refuge use but produced elongate shells with high spires that allowed for greater retraction of the soft tissue. Seastar-induced phenotypes reduced susceptibility to seastars relative to crab-induced phenotypes, but crab-induced phenotypes did not significantly reduce susceptibility to crabs, indicating an asymmetrical functional trade-off. When feeding predators were combined, snails produced a morphological phenotype similar to that expressed in the presence of the predator that imposed the highest mortality at the population level, suggesting that predator-induced morphology was prioritized according to predation risk. These results suggest that prioritizing conflicting defenses according to predator danger may be a common strategy for prey responding to combined predators, particularly in conjunction with generalized behavioral responses that reduce overall risk in multiple-predator environments. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Antipredator behavior; Cancer productus; Inducible defenses; Multiple predators; Multiple traits; Nucella lamellosa; Phenotypic integration; Phenotypic plasticity; Pisaster ochraceus; Predation risk; Shell morphology; Trade-off","antipredator defense; behavioral response; conspecific; crab; habitat use; marine ecosystem; morphology; phenotype; phenotypic plasticity; physiological response; predation risk; refuge; shell; snail; adaptation; animal; animal behavior; article; Brachyura; echinoderm; histology; phenotype; physiology; snail; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brachyura; Echinodermata; Phenotype; Snails; Cancer productus; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Nucella lamellosa; Pisaster ochraceus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-67449161801

Widespread contamination of harbors and areas with high shipping activities occurs globally due to the ongoing use of tributyltin (TBT) in antifouling paints on large vessels. In the last decade, organotin pollution has spread to developing countries. Contamination decreased only slowly several years after regulation of antifouling paints in small vessels and remains widespread in sediments and marine biota. TBT degradation in sediment is very slow under anaerobic conditions and remobilization occurs via mixing and dredging. Ecotoxicological effects occur globally in marine gastropods, which are affected by masculinization (imposex) at ng L -1 levels leading to population declines. Present TBT levels in harbors and adjacent areas are still in the range of effect levels. Recently, also androgenic activity of TBT in fish was reported. A large variety of organisms, in particular early life stages, are susceptible to low TBT concentrations of a few 100 ng L -1. Bioaccumulation leads to significant residues in aquatic biota including marine mammals. Despite regulations, ecotoxicologically relevant contamination of marine ecosystems is persisting, particularly in sediments. The recent spread into developing countries indicates that organotin contamination has ongoing ecotoxicological relevance globally. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.","Ecotoxicological effects; Environmental contamination; Organotins; Tributyltin; Triphenyltin","Gastropoda; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748892509

However, studies conducted along coastal Patagonia have showed hydrocarbon pollution mostly concentrated at ports that have fishing, oil loading, general merchant, and/or tourist activities. A high value of total aliphatic hydrocarbons (TAH) was found at the Rawson fishing port (741 μg/g dw). In other ports with and without petroleum-related activities, hydrocarbon values were approximately 100 μg/g dw. The highest values for TAH and total aromatic hydrocarbons (TArH) were found in Faro Aristizábal, north of San Jorge gulf (1304 and 737 μg/g dw, respectively). This is very likely the result of petroleum-related activities at the Comodoro Rivadavia, Caleta Cordova, and Caleta Olivia ports located within this gulf. In other coastal areas away from potential anthropogenic sources, hydrocarbon values were less than 2 and 3 μg/g dw for TAH and TArH, respectively. This review of published and unpublished information suggests that ports are important oil pollution sources in the Patagonian coast. More detailed studies are needed to evaluate the area affected by port activities, to understand the mechanisms of hydrocarbon distribution in surrounding environments, and to assess bioaccumulation in marine organisms. Despite that some regulations exist to control oil pollution derived from port and docked vessel activities, new and stricter management guidelines should be implemented. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Argentina; Coastal zone; Hydrocarbon sources; Oil pollution; Patagonia; Ports","Coastal areas; Hydrocarbon sources; Marine organisms; Oil pollution; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Bioaccumulation; Coastal zones; Crude petroleum; Environmental management; Marine pollution; aliphatic hydrocarbon; aromatic hydrocarbon; hydrocarbon; petroleum; anthropogenic source; aromatic hydrocarbon; assessment method; bioaccumulation; coastal zone; oil pollution; port; pristine environment; Argentina; bioaccumulation; coastal waters; marine environment; marine species; pollution; publication; review; water pollution; Argentina; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Geography; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; Argentina; Atlantic Ocean; Cabo Aristizabal; Caleta Cordova; Caleta Olivia; Chubut; Comodoro Rivadavia; Patagonia; San Jorge Gulf; Santa Cruz [Argentina]; South America; Caleta; Olivia",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-35648969162

However, effects of TBT and other pollutants from high marine traffic zones on the shell of gastropods have been little explored. Shell shape in volutids Odontocymbiola magellanica from a harbor polluted site (P) has been compared with that of animals from a non-polluted location (NP) using 3D geometric morphometrics. Also, the microstructure and density of shells from both populations were analyzed. Prior studies madein the same area (Golfo Nuevo, Patagonia, Argentina) based on traditional multivariate morphometrics showedsome differences in size butwas unable to detect differences in shell shape among O. magellanica from P and NP areas. Departing from 3D geometric morphometrics, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and computed tomography (CT) techniques, we have registered the presence of patent differences on shell shape and structure in animals from polluted (P) and non-polluted (NP) areas. In 100% of shells from the NP area we register three calcium carbonate layers (prismatic, cross lamellar and amorphous) and higher densities, while in 50% of the shells collected at the P area the external layer (amorphous) was lacking. Furthermore, a body weight loss of around 30% and a shell weight loss of 20% were registered in animals from the P area. Our combined results suggest that the coordinated use of 3D geometrics morphometrics, CT scan and SEM could be of great utility in order to detect the effect of environmental variables on Neogastropods shell shape and structure. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Strong deformation of the shell, including elongation of the posterior end and the appearance of an easily visible flexure in this part, has been recorded. The population contribution of the deformed blunt shelled (""irregular"") clams ranged from 0% to 65% and tended to increase with depth. The morphologically ""irregular"" clams had higher accumulated tissue concentrations of trace metals (As, Ag, Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn), indicating a different metal handling ability. Adverse conditions in deeper water regions of the Gulf (e.g. hypoxia, hydrogen sulphide, elevated bioavailability of contaminants) have been suggested as inducers of the phenotypical changes (morphological deformation) in part of the population and, in parallel, of the specific physiological adaptations that result in higher metal accumulation in the ""irregular"" clams. Cytogenetic and histological analyses showed the presence of tumours in gill cells and digestive system of the affected clams, the prevalence of disseminated neoplasia ranging from 0% to 94% depending on the site. The disease was manifested by a modified karyotype (i.e. an abnormal number and morphology of chromosomes), a higher activity of nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs), and tissue lesions (enlarged cells, actively proliferative with pleomorphic nuclei). Bottom sediments showed acute toxicity and have been proposed as a source of an initialising carcinogenic factor. However, none of the ecotoxicological studies provided was successful in the clear demonstration of a single (or multifactorial) agent that can account for the disseminated neoplasia. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The morphology of this species was studied in 6 sites near the city of Quequén, differing in intertidal height and degree of exposure to wave action and pollution. Shell length, width, height, and the distance from apex to posterior shell margin were measured, as well as the dry weight of both the shell and limpet body. A data matrix of 600 individuals (100 limpets per site) by 6 variables was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) in order to compare size and shape differences among sites. As expected, axis I of the PCA explained a very high percentage (87.7%) of total variance, and can be interpreted as a size factor. Axis II, which summarised 6.9 %, may be regarded as expressing shell shape. Limpets not exposed to wave action within Quequén Harbour showed the highest values in all variables, whereas individuals living within the Brachidontes rodriguezi (d'Orbigny, 1846) community were very small and highly variable. Limpets heavily exposed to sewage at mid intertidal levels had a subcentral shell apex and were relatively very low. Classification of individuals by DA showed that the most characteristic morphology corresponded to limpets living at mid intertidal level close to a sewage outfall, or within Quequén Harbour (94 and 97 % correct reallocations, respectively). The influence of different physical and biotic factors on the morphology of Siphonaria lessoni is discussed.","Argentina; Intertidal; Limpet; Shape; Siphonaria lessoni; Size","intertidal environment; mollusc; morphometry; pollution exposure; wave action; Argentina",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035042705

Our hypothesis is that morphological and behavioral patterns of T. geversianus represent habitat-specific constrains; subsequently we expect an association between shell morphology, attachment behavior, and habitat. In order to test this hypothesis we compared individuals from intertidal and subtidal habitats, at three sites in Golfo Nuevo (Argentina). We analyzed shell morphology using classic morphometric variables, 3D geometric morphometrics and computing tomography scan. The results were complemented with field observations of attachment to substrate and turning time behavior, as well as of the number of shell scars produced by crab predation. Our results showed differences in shell size and shape between intertidal and subtidal-collected individuals. Centroid size, total weight and shell weight, as well as shell density and thickness were significantly lower in intertidal individuals than in subtidal ones. Gastropods from intertidal habitats presented a low-spired shell and an expanded aperture which might allow better attachment to the bottom substrate, while subtidal individuals presented a slender and narrower shell shape. The number of crab scars was significantly higher in shells from subtidal individuals. Observations of the behavior of gastropods placed at the intertidal splash zone showed 100% of attachment to the bottom in the intertidal individuals, while subtidal specimens only attached in average in 32% of the cases. These latter took 12 times longer to re-attach to the bottom when faced up. Phylogenetic analysis of COI gene fragments showed no consistent differences among individuals sampled in both habitats. All these results suggest that T. geversianus has developed two ecomorphs with distinct morphological and behavioral responses to physically stressful conditions registered in north Patagonian intertidals, as opposed to lower physical stress but higher predation pressure in the subtidal habitats. The findings of this work constitute a starting point in the study of ecological adaptation processes in gastropods from Patagonian coastal environments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","3D Geometric Morphometrics; COI; CT Scan; Rocky Shores; Subtidal","behavioral ecology; ecomorphology; environmental conditions; environmental stress; gastropod; geographical distribution; marine ecosystem; morphometry; polymorphism; shell; substrate; Patagonia; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Trophon geversianus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027933219

The nassariid Buccinanops globulosus is interesting to study shell shape variation because it exhibits strong interpopulation differences in life history features, including maximum size, fecundity and growth rate. In this study, we examined the pattern of variation in size and shell shape among populations and between sexes of B. globulosus (Bahía San Antonio 40°29′S 63°01′W, Playa Villarino 40°45′S 64°40′W and Bahía Nueva 42°46′S 65°02′W). In particular, we used geometric morphometric techniques to test: (1) whether the two components of shell morphology (size and shape) are independent and (2) whether shape differences between sexes are consistently found among populations, regardless of their body sizes. Our results show shell shape variation between the populations of B. globulosus of northern Patagonia. Intra-specific shell shape variation is affected by body size, indicating allometry. Regardless of the size differences, individuals from Playa Villarino have high-spired shells, and shorter apertures and wider columellar area than individuals from the other populations. Also, sex-related shape differences were consistently found at each population, thus suggesting a common sexual dimorphism in shell morphology for this species. The functional significance of the variability found is discussed in terms of the flexibility of developmental programmes for morphology as well as the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and AWI.","Buccinanops; Geometric Morphometric; Landmarks; Nassariidae; Shell shape; Variability","body size; gastropod; growth rate; invertebrate; morphology; morphometry; sexual dimorphism; shell; Patagonia; Gastropoda; Invertebrata; Nassariidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882830036

Cause-effect relationship between TBT and imposex development in females of marine gastropods is well documented. We tested whether the imposex incidence associated with TBT pollution is related to detectable shell-shape variations in the edible marine snail (Buccinanops globulosus). We compared shell shape of B. globulosus in six contiguous sites on a gradient of imposex and maritime traffic, by using geometric morphometric analysis. Our results indicated that the registered differences in shell shape are associated to imposex incidence in the harbour zone where previous works have detected TBT pollution. Gastropods from areas of high maritime traffic presented a rounded shell with a shorter spire, and a smaller relative size of the shell aperture, whereas the opposite shape (fusiform shape, elongated-spired shell and bigger relative size of the shell aperture) occurred in gastropod shells from areas of low maritime traffic. Shell variation registered here could be useful to detect TBT pollution in populations of B. globulosus and another neogastropod species. © CSIRO 2016.","geometric morphometrics; marine pollution; organotin compounds; Patagonia; TBT; tributyltin","anthropogenic effect; bioindicator; gastropod; harbor; imposex; marine pollution; maritime transportation; morphometry; organic compound; pollution incidence; shell; Patagonia; Gastropoda; Neogastropoda",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84998679674

We examined the relationship between the known history of female sterility and the present genetic diversity (measured by five allozyme-loci) and phenotypic variance (measured by nine quantitative characters) in six populations of Nucella lapillus along the coast of Norway. The environment of one of the populations was severely polluted with a vas deferens sequence index (VDSI) of 4.31, resulting in 24% sterile females. The environment of four of the other five populations was moderately polluted (VDSI 3.31-3.97, 0-1.6% sterile females), while the last population was unpolluted (VDSI 0.02, 0% sterile females). The six populations did not differ significantly with respect to genetic diversity. However, the population from the most polluted area had greater phenotypic variation in shell size, compared to all other populations. The results indicate that although TBT has had severe local negative effects on N. lapillus populations, it has not caused a reduction in long-term adaptive potential. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This variation can be induced by physical or biological factors such as wave exposure and predation. We examined shell variation in the direct-developing Acanthina monodon. In a field survey, we collected and analysed two snail ecotypes: a thick-shelled ecotype from environments with intense predation by the crab Homalaspis plana, and a thin-shelled ecotype from environments where predation was negligible. When we controlled for shell length, the thick-shelled ecotype had a heavier and thicker shell, but lower body weight, than the thin-shelled ecotype. However, only shell thickness and body weight showed a significant difference between habitat types. In order to determine the nature of shell variation in A. monodon, we conducted a laboratory experiment with juvenile snails from sites where the predation was low or absent. Seawater aquaria containing crabs were connected to aquaria containing snails via a cylinder with flows that enabled the transport of seawater from crabs to the snails aquaria. The snails treated with seawater-borne stimuli (predation treatment) developed thicker shells than the snails raised in the absence of the stimulus (control treatment). We suggest that adaptive phenotypic plasticity may account for part of the shell variation surveyed in the field. We discuss the metabolic and reproductive costs of maintaining anti-predator defence strategies that involve adaptive morphological changes to a particular environment. © 2012 The Author.",,"antiparasite defense; crab; ecotype; field survey; gastropod; habitat type; marine ecosystem; morphology; phenotypic plasticity; polymorphism; seawater; shell; sympatry; Acanthina monodon; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gastropoda; Homalaspis plana; Muricidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860488720

A distributional approach was employed, and a systematic surface sampling in several landscape units were performed, registering all lithic artifacts and other variables that could influence the archaeological visibility. The landscape units identified in this sector were: high plateau, plateau flank, cañadón León, temporary lagoons, and coast. The artifactual assemblage recovered is presented, analyzed and discussed in relation to several archaeological expectations derived from the resource availability of the different landscape units. Results are discussed in relation to ways in which these landscape units could have been used by hunter-gatherer populations that inhabited this sector during Late Holocene, considering the differential availability of resources of importance to Patagonian human groups. In this sense, the archaeological expectations were contrasted, with higher densities near the coast and lower densities on inland landscape units. Among the first, the availability of alimentary resources (mainly shellfish, fish and pinniped) would have produced longer residential settlement. Among inland landscape units, some differences were observed, which were related to variation in resources availability, such as fresh water sources and lithic raw materials. In this latter, more variability than anticipated according to the archaeological expectations was detected. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Distributional archaeology; Hunter-gatherers; Lithic artifacts; Patagonia; San Jorge gulf; Surface samples","archaeological evidence; archaeology; artifact; Holocene; human settlement; hunter-gatherer; lithic fragment; spatial distribution; tool use; Argentina; Atlantic Ocean; Patagonia; San Jorge Gulf; Santa Cruz [Argentina]; Pinnipedia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930575973

Previous studies have focused on juvenile and adult snails; however, adaptive plasticity might be expected to begin during embryonic and early post-embryonic stages as a means of increasing survivorship when individuals first become vulnerable. We tested the above hypothesis by measuring shell morphology of encapsulated embryos and hatchlings of Acanthina monodon exposed to predator odor and water turbulence. Subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments: (1) predator odor + high water turbulence, (2) no predator odor + high water turbulence, (3) predator odor + low water turbulence, (4) no predator odor + low water turbulence (control). After approximately 1 mo, morphological traits of the shell were measured using geometric morphometrics. Hatchlings, but not encapsulated offspring, produced larger shells in the predator treatments. Encapsulated offspring and hatchlings produced thicker shells in the predator treatments, irrespective of water turbulence, whereas thinner shells were produced when high water turbulence acted alone. Even before hatching, A. monodon can, thus, respond adaptively to potential mortality factors characterizing the local external environment. Anticipating risk in this way should enhance survivorship from the point of hatching through the vulnerable juvenile phase to adulthood. © Inter-Research 2015.","Direct development; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological adaptation; Phenotypic plasticity","adaptation; environmental effect; environmental risk; marine ecosystem; phenotypic plasticity; predation risk; shell; snail; survivorship; turbulence; Acanthina monodon; Gastropoda; Mollusca",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930717322
