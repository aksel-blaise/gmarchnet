The objective of this report is to provide a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of the Pleistocene when sea levels were below present day levels. Location: The maps presented here cover tropical Southeast Asia and Austral-Asia. The east-west coverage extends 8000 km from Australia to Sri Lanka. The north-south coverage extends 5000 km from Taiwan to Australia. Methods: Present-day bathymetric depth contours were used to estimate past shore lines and the locations of the major drowned river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves. The timing of sea level changes associated with glaciation over the past 250,000 years was taken from multiple sources that, in some cases, account for tectonic uplift and subsidence during the period in question. Results: This report provides a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of 17,000, 150,000 and 250,000 years before present. The ancient shorelines are based on present day depth contours of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 120 m. On the maps depicting shorelines at 75, 100 and 120 m below present levels the major Pleistocene river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves are depicted. Estimates of the number of major sea level fluctuation events and the duration of time that sea levels were at or below the illustrated level are provided. Main conclusions: Previous reconstructions of sea-level change during the Pleistocene have emphasized the maximum lows. The perspective provided here emphasizes that sea levels were at their maximum lows for relatively short periods of time but were at or below intermediate levels (e.g. at or below 40 m below present-day levels) for more than half of each of the time periods considered.","Biogeography; Maps; Palaeogeography; Pleistocene; Sea levels; Southeast Asia","deglaciation; glaciation; Pleistocene; river system; sea level change; shoreline change; timescale; Asia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034492377

Both species are characterized by greater brain size, increased body height and smaller teeth relative to Pliocene Australopithecus in Africa. Here we report the discovery, from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia, of an adult hominin with stature and endocranial volume approximating 1 m and 380cm3, respectively-equal to the smallest-known australopithecines. The combination of primitive and derived features assigns this hominin to a new species, Homo floresiensis. The most likely explanation for its existence on Flores is long-term isolation, with subsequent endemic dwarfing, of an ancestral H. erectus population. Importantly, H. floresiensis shows that the genus Homo is morphologically more varied and flexible in its adaptive responses than previously thought.",,"Brain; Morphology; Adaptive response; Endemic dwarfing; Hominin; Pliocene; Biodiversity; hominid; new species; Pleistocene; anthropology; artifact; Asia; body height; brain size; comparative study; hominid; human; Indonesia; pleistocene; priority journal; review; skeleton; species differentiation; adult; animal; article; body constitution; bone; classification; evolution; female; geography; histology; history; skeleton; skull; time; tooth; Asia; East Nusa Tenggara; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Flores [Lesser Sunda Islands]; Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Malay Archipelago; Southeast Asia; Sunda Isles; World; Australopithecus; Hominidae; Homo; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Adult; Animals; Body Constitution; Bone and Bones; Evolution; Female; Geography; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Indonesia; Skeleton; Skull; Time Factors; Tooth",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-7744243968

Until now, the importance of these finds has been constrained by limited chronologies and palaeoenvironmental information. Mungo III, the source of the world's oldest human mitochondrial DNA, has been variously estimated at 30 thousand years (kyr) old, 42-45 kyr old and 62 ± 6 kyr old, while radiocarbon estimates placed the Mungo I cremation near 20-26 kyr ago. Here we report a new series of 25 optical ages showing that both burials occurred at 40 ± 2 kyr ago and that humans were present at Lake Mungo by 50-46 kyr ago, synchronously with, or soon after, initial occupation of northern and western Australia. Stratigraphic evidence indicates fluctuations between lake-full and drier conditions from 50 to 40kyr ago, simultaneously with increased dust deposition, human arrival and continent-wide extinction of the megafauna. This was followed by sustained aridity between 40 and 30 kyr ago. This new chronology corrects previous estimates for human burials at this important site and provides a new picture of Homo sapiens adapting to deteriorating climate in the world's driest inhabited continent.",,"DNA; Ecology; Radioisotopes; Stratigraphy; Palaeoenvironmental informations; Climate change; mitochondrial DNA; climate change; human settlement; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; Quaternary; radiocarbon dating; article; Australia; chronology; climate; dust; fauna; human; occupation; paleoenvironment; posthumous care; priority journal; stratigraphy; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Archaeology; Burial; Climate; Culture; Emigration and Immigration; Evolution; Fresh Water; Hominidae; Humans; Natural Disasters; New South Wales; Time Factors; Australia; Homo; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037456388

Here we report a large-scale survey of autosomal variation from a broad geographic sample of Asian human populations. Our results show that genetic ancestry is strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations as well as geography. Most populations show relatedness within ethnic/linguistic groups, despite prevalent gene flow among populations. More than 90% of East Asian (EA) haplotypes could be found in either Southeast Asian (SEA) or Central-South Asian (CSA) populations and show clinal structure with haplotype diversity decreasing from south to north. Furthermore, 50% of EA haplotypes were found in SEA only and 5% were found in CSA only, indicating that SEA was a major geographic source of EA populations.",,"ancestry; cultural geography; ethnicity; genetic variation; relatedness; article; Asia; autosomal inheritance; biogeography; ethnic group; gene flow; gene mapping; genetic variability; haplotype; human; linguistics; population genetics; priority journal; South Asia; Southeast Asia; Algorithms; Asia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Gene Flow; Genotype; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Humans; Language; Linguistics; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; Asia; Eurasia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-72149083621

This paper presents one such case study: Niah Cave in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, famous for the discovery in 1958 in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of a modern human skull, the 'Deep Skull,' controversially associated with radiocarbon dates of ca. 40,000 years before the present. A new chronostratigraphy has been developed through a re-investigation of the lithostratigraphy left by the earlier excavations, AMS-dating using three different comparative pre-treatments including ABOX of charcoal, and U-series using the Diffusion-Absorption model applied to fragments of bones from the Deep Skull itself. Stratigraphic reasons for earlier uncertainties about the antiquity of the skull are examined, and it is shown not to be an 'intrusive' artifact. It was probably excavated from fluvial-pond-desiccation deposits that accumulated episodically in a shallow basin immediately behind the cave entrance lip, in a climate that ranged from times of comparative aridity with complete desiccation, to episodes of greater surface wetness, changes attributed to regional climatic fluctuations. Vegetation outside the cave varied significantly over time, including wet lowland forest, montane forest, savannah, and grassland. The new dates and the lithostratigraphy relate the Deep Skull to evidence of episodes of human activity that range in date from ca. 46,000 to ca. 34,000 years ago. Initial investigations of sediment scorching, pollen, palynomorphs, phytoliths, plant macrofossils, and starch grains recovered from existing exposures, and of vertebrates from the current and the earlier excavations, suggest that human foraging during these times was marked by habitat-tailored hunting technologies, the collection and processing of toxic plants for consumption, and, perhaps, the use of fire at some forest-edges. The Niah evidence demonstrates the sophisticated nature of the subsistence behavior developed by modern humans to exploit the tropical environments that they encountered in Southeast Asia, including rainforest. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Most analysts favor either a 40,000 BP or 60,000 BP arrival time, though some have proposed a much earlier date. Here we review data from more than 30 archaeological sites with basal ages >20,000 years reported since 1993, giving special attention to five sites with purported ages >45,000 years. We conclude that while the continent was probably occupied by 42-45,000 BP, earlier arrival dates are not well-supported. This observation undercuts claims for modern human migrations out of Africa and beyond the Levant before 50,000 BP. It also has critical but not yet conclusive implications for arguments about a human role in the extinction of Sahul megafauna. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The isotopic Th/U and Pa/U ratios indicate that some minor uranium mobilization may have occurred in the past. Taking such effects into account, the best age estimate for the human skeleton is obtained through the combination of U-series and ESR analyses yielding 62,000 ± 6000 years. This age is in close agreement with OSL age estimates on the sediment into which the skeleton was buried of 61,000 ± 2000 years. Furthermore, we obtained a U-series age of 81,000 ± 21,000 years for the calcitic matrix that was precipitated on the bones after burial. All age results are considerably older than the previously assumed age of LM3 and demonstrate the necessity for directly dating hominid remains. We conclude that the Lake Mungo 3 burial documents the earliest known human presence on the Australian continent. The age implies that people who were skeletally within the range of the present Australian indigenous population colonized the continent during or before oxygen isotope stage 4 (57,000-71,000 years).","ESR; Lake Mungo 3; OSL dating; U-series","electron spin resonance dating; uranium series dating; Australia; Lake Mungo; New South Wales; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033150554

Traditional hypotheses assume that the small body size of human pygmies is an adaptation to special challenges, such as thermoregulation, locomotion in dense forests, or endurance against starvation. Here, we present an analysis of stature, growth, and individual fitness for a large population of Aeta and a smaller one of Batak from the Philippines and compare it with data on other pygmy groups accumulated by anthropologists for a century. The results challenge traditional explanations of human pygmy body size. We argue that human pygmy populations and adaptations evolved independently as the result of a life history tradeoff between the fertility benefits of larger body size against the costs of late growth cessation, under circumstances of significant young and adult mortality. Human pygmies do not appear to have evolved through positive selection for small stature - this was a by-product of selection for early onset of reproduction. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Body size; Demography; Fertility; Height; Mortality","adaptation; adult; article; body build; body growth; body size; child; endurance; evolution; female; fertility; fitness; fossil; human; life history; locomotion; major clinical study; male; mortality; Philippines; priority journal; species; starvation; thermoregulation; Evolution; Fertility; Fossils; History, Ancient; Humans; Life; Mortality; Philippines; Homo floresiensis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-38049161801

The best known modern humans are from Niah Cave in Borneo (40-42. ka), and from Tabon Cave on the island of Palawan, southwest Philippines (47±11 ka). The discovery of Homo floresiensis on the island of Flores in eastern Indonesia has also highlighted the possibilities of identifying new hominin species on islands in the region. Here, we report the discovery of a human third metatarsal from Callao Cave in northern Luzon. Direct dating of the specimen using U-series ablation has provided a minimum age estimate of 66.7 ± 1 ka, making it the oldest known human fossil in the Philippines. Its morphological features, as well as size and shape characteristics, indicate that the Callao metatarsal definitely belongs to the genus Homo. Morphometric analysis of the Callao metatarsal indicates that it has a gracile structure, close to that observed in other small-bodied Homo sapiens. Interestingly, the Callao metatarsal also falls within the morphological and size ranges of Homo habilis and H. floresiensis. Identifying whether the metatarsal represents the earliest record of H. sapiens so far recorded anywhere east of Wallace's Line requires further archaeological research, but its presence on the isolated island of Luzon over 65,000 years ago further demonstrates the abilities of humans to make open ocean crossings in the Late Pleistocene. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cave faunas; Hominin dispersal; Southeast Asia; U-series dating","bone; cave deposit; dispersal; fossil record; hominid; morphology; morphometry; uranium series dating; Cagayan; Cagayan Valley; Callao Cave; Luzon; Philippines; Gabaza; Homo floresiensis; Homo habilis; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954218799

The Andamanese and other Asian small-statured peoples, traditionally known as ""Negritos,"" resemble African pygmies. However, it is generally believed that they descend from the early Australo-Melanesian settlers of Southeast Asia and that their resemblance to some Africans is due to adaptation to a similar environment, rather than shared origins. Results: We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and RFLP polymorphisms, and Y chromosome biallelic markers and microsatellites, in present-day Andamanese of the Onge, Jarawa, and Great Andamanese tribes, and of inhabitants of the neighboring Nicobar Islands. We also analyzed mtDNA sequences from Andamanese hair samples collected by an ethnographer during 1906-1908. Living Andamanese exhibit low genetic variability that is consistent with their small population size and reproductive isolation. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the Andamanese have closer affinities to Asian than to African populations and suggest that they are the descendants of the early Palaeolithic colonizers of Southeast Asia. In contrast, the Nicobarese have genetic affinities to groups widely distributed throughout Asia today, presumably descended from Neolithic agriculturalists.",,"Alleles; Base Sequence; Chromosomes, Human, Y; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ethnic Groups; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; India; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Genetic",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037458112

Proponents of the single-origin model often view this group as a distinct species with little or no contribution to the evolution of modern humans. Adherents to the regional continuity model consider Neanderthals a subspecies or population of Homo sapiens, which contributed significantly to the evolution of early modern Europeans. Paleontologists generally agree that fossil species should be equivalent to extant ones in the amount of their morphological variation. Recognition of fossil species therefore hinges on analogy to living species. A previous study by one of the authors and recent work by other researchers [Schillachi, M. A. & Froelich, J. W. (2001) Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 115, 157-166] have supported specific status for Neanderthals based on analogy to chimpanzees and Sulawesi macaques, respectively. However, these taxa may not be the most appropriate models for Pleistocene humans. Here we test the hypothesis that Neanderthals represent a subspecies of H. sapiens by comparing the degree of their morphological differentiation from modern humans to that found within and between 12 species of extant primates. The model taxa comprised >1,000 specimens, including phylogenetic (modern humans and African apes) and ecological (eight papionin taxa) models for Pleistocene humans. Morphological distances between model taxon pairs were compared to the distances between Neanderthals and modern humans obtained by using a randomization technique.

The skeleton of the type specimen (LB1) of H. floresiensis includes a relatively complete left foot and parts of the right foot. These feet provide insights into the evolution of bipedalism and, together with the rest of the skeleton, have implications for hominin dispersal events into Asia. Here we show that LB1s foot is exceptionally long relative to the femur and tibia, proportions never before documented in hominins but seen in some African apes. Although the metatarsal robusticity sequence is human-like and the hallux is fully adducted, other intrinsic proportions and pedal features are more ape-like. The postcranial anatomy of H. floresiensis is that of a biped, but the unique lower-limb proportions and surprising combination of derived and primitive pedal morphologies suggest kinematic and biomechanical differences from modern human gait. Therefore, LB1 offers the most complete glimpse of a bipedal hominin foot that lacks the full suite of derived features characteristic of modern humans and whose mosaic design may be primitive for the genus Homo. These new findings raise the possibility that the ancestor of H. floresiensis was not Homo erectus but instead some other, more primitive, hominin whose dispersal into southeast Asia is still undocumented. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The convergent evolution of this phenotype, and its strong association with tropical rainforests, have motivated adaptive hypotheses that stress the advantages of small size for coping with food limitation, warm, humid conditions and dense forest undergrowth. Most recently, a life-history model has been used to suggest that the human pygmy phenotype is a consequence of early growth cessation that evolved to facilitate early reproductive onset amid conditions of high adult mortality. As we discuss here, these adaptive scenarios are not mutually exclusive and should be evaluated in consort.

We have analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNAs) control-region and coding-region markers in 447 mtDNAs from the region, including 260 Orang Asli, representative of each of the traditional groupings, the Semang, the Senoi, and the Aboriginal Malays, allowing us to test hypotheses about their origins. All of the Orang Asli groups have undergone high levels of genetic drift, but phylogeographic traces nevertheless remain of the ancestry of their maternal lineages. The Semang have a deep ancestry within the Malay Peninsula, dating to the initial settlement from Africa >50,000 years ago. The Senoi appear to be a composite group, with approximately half of the maternal lineages tracing back to the ancestors of the Semang and about half to Indochina. This is in agreement with the suggestion that they represent the descendants of early Austroasiatic speaking agriculturalists, who brought both their language and their technology to the southern part of the peninsula ∼4,000 years ago and coalesced with the indigenous population. The Aboriginal Malays are more diverse, and although they show some connections with island Southeast Asia, as expected, they also harbor haplogroups that are either novel or rare elsewhere. Contrary to expectations, complete mtDNA genome sequences from one of these, R9b, suggest an ancestry in Indochina around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, followed by an early-Holocene dispersal through the Malay Peninsula into island Southeast Asia. © The Author 2006.

The faunal assemblage comprises well-preserved mammal, bird, reptile and mollusc remains, including examples of island gigantism in small mammals and the dwarfing of large taxa. Together with evidence from Early-Middle Pleistocene sites in the Soa Basin, it confirms the long-term isolation, impoverishment, and phylogenetic continuity of the Flores faunal community. The accumulation of Stegodon and Komodo dragon remains at the site in the Pleistocene is attributed to Homo floresiensis, while predatory birds, including an extinct species of owl, were largely responsible for the accumulation of the small vertebrates. The disappearance from the sequence of the two large-bodied, endemic mammals, Stegodon florensis insularis and Homo floresiensis, was associated with a volcanic eruption at 17 ka and precedes the earliest evidence for modern humans, who initiated use of mollusc and shell working, and began to introduce a range of exotic animals to the island. Faunal introductions during the Holocene included the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) at about 7 ka, followed by the Eurasian pig (Sus scrofa), Long-tailed macaque, Javanese porcupine, and Masked palm civet at about 4 ka, and cattle, deer, and horse - possibly by the Portuguese within historic times. The Holocene sequence at the site also documents local faunal extinctions - a result of accelerating human population growth, habitat loss, and over-exploitation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Such biased sampling precludes many analyses of interest. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing platforms to generate, rapidly and inexpensively, 109 complete mtDNA genome sequences from random samples of individuals from three Filipino groups, including one Negrito group, the Mamanwa. We obtained on average ∼55-fold coverage per sequence, with <1% missing data per sequence. Various analyses attest to the accuracy of the sequences, including comparison to sequences of the first hypervariable segment of the control region generated by Sanger sequencing; patterns of nucleotide substitution and the distribution of polymorphic sites across the genome; and the observed haplogroups. Bayesian skyline plots of population size change through time indicate similar patterns for all three Filipino groups, but sharply contrast with such plots previously constructed from biased sampling of complete mtDNA genomes, as well as with an artificially constructed sample of sequences that mimics the biased sampling.

LB1 is represented by a bony pelvis (damaged but now repaired), femora, tibiae, fibulae, patellae, and numerous foot bones. LB4/2 is an immature right tibia lacking epiphyses. LB6 includes a fragmentary metatarsal and two pedal phalanges. LB8 is a nearly complete right tibia (shorter than that of LB1). LB9 is a fragment of a hominin femoral diaphysis. LB10 is a proximal hallucal phalanx. LB11 includes pelvic fragments and a fragmentary metatarsal. LB13 is a patellar fragment, and LB14 is a fragment of an acetabulum. All skeletal remains recovered from Liang Bua were extremely fragile, and some were badly damaged when they were removed temporarily from Jakarta. At present, virtually all fossil materials have been returned, stabilized, and hardened. These skeletal remains are described and illustrated photographically. The lower limb skeleton exhibits a uniquely mosaic pattern, with many primitive-like morphologies; we have been unable to find this combination of ancient and derived (more human-like) features in either healthy or pathological modern humans, regardless of body size. Bilateral asymmetries are slight in the postcranium, and muscle markings are clearly delineated on all bones. The long bones are robust, and the thickness of their cortices is well within the ranges seen in healthy modern humans. LB1 is most probably a female based on the shape of her greater sciatic notch, and the marked degree of lateral iliac flaring recalls that seen in australopithecines such as ""Lucy"" (AL 288-1). The metatarsus has a human-like robusticity formula, but the proximal pedal phalanges are relatively long and robust (and slightly curved).

Some workers consider this fossil human group to represent a different species. Homo neanderthalensis, while others see it as a subspecies of Homo sapiens. This study developed two models of morphological variation to be applied to a comparison between Neanderthals and modern humans: modern human populations provided a measure of intra-specific variation, while the species and subspecies of Pan provided measures of both intra- and inter-specific morphological differences. Although such an approach has been advocated strongly, it has not been systematically undertaken until recently. The techniques of geometric morphometrics were used to collect data in the form of three-dimensional coordinates of craniofacial landmarks. The data were processed using generalized procrustes analysis, and analyzed by an array of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components analysis, canonical variates analysis and Mahalanobis D2. The morphological distances between Neanderthals and modern humans, and between Neanderthals and Late Paleolithic/early anatomically modern specimens, are consistently greater than the distances among recent human populations, and greater than the distances between the two chimpanzee species. Furthermore, no strong morphological similarities were found between Neanderthals and Late Paleolithic Europeans. This study does not find evidence for Neanderthal contribution to the evolution of modern Europeans. Results are consistent with the recognition of Neanderthals as a distinct species. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To gain further resolution regarding this debate, 3D geometric morphometric data were used to quantify overall shape variation in the cranial vault within H. erectus using a new metric, the sum of squared pairwise Procrustes distances (SSD). Bootstrapping methods were used to compare the H. erectus SSD to a broad range of human and nonhuman primate samples in order to ascertain whether variation in H. erectus most clearly resembles that seen in one or more species. The reference taxa included relevant phylogenetic, ecological, and temporal analogs including humans, apes, and both extant and extinct papionin monkeys. The mean cranial shapes of different temporogeographic subsets of H. erectus fossils were then tested for significance using exact randomization tests and compared to the distances between regional groups of modern humans and subspecies/species of the ape and papionin monkey taxa. To gauge the influence of sexual dimorphism on levels of variation, comparisons were also made between the mean cranial shapes of single-sex samples for the reference taxa. Results indicate that variation in H. erectus is most comparable to single species of papionin monkeys and the genus Pan, which included two species. However, H. erectus encompasses a limited range of variation given its extensive geographic and temporal range, leading to the conclusion that only one species should be recognized. In addition, there are significant differences between the African/Georgian and Asian H. erectus samples, but not between H. ergaster (Georgia + Africa, excluding OH 9 and Daka) and H. erectus sensu stricto. This finding is in line with expectations for intraspecific variation in a long-lived species with a wide, but probably discontinuous, geographic distribution. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We find extreme diversity in the Y-chromosome lineages of Filipino groups with heterogeneity seen in both Negrito and non-Negrito groups, which does not support a simple dichotomy of Filipino groups as Negrito vs non-Negrito. Filipino non-recombining region of the human Y chromosome lineages reflect a chronology that extends from after the initial colonization of the Asia-Pacific region, to the time frame of the Austronesian expansion. Filipino groups appear to have diverse genetic affinities with different populations in the Asia-Pacific region.

These deposits are divided into two formations, the Ilagan and Awidon Mesa, and three lithofacies associations. The facies, which are interpreted as meandering stream, braided stream, lahar, and pyroclastic flow and fall deposits, occur in a coarsening upward sequence. Meandering stream deposits interbedded with tuffs are overlain by braided stream deposits interbedded with coarser pyroclastic deposits; lahars and ignimbrites. The coarsening upward volcaniclastic deposits reflect the tectonic and volcanic evolution of the adjacent Cordillera Central volcanic arc. Uplift of the arc resulted in the progradation of coarser clastics further into the basin, the development of an alluvial fan, and migration of the basin depocentre away from the arc. The coarsening of the pyroclastic deposits reflects the development of a more proximal calc‐alkaline volcanic belt in the maturing volcanic arc. The Cagayan basin sediments serve as an example of the type and sequence of non marine volcaniclastic sediments that may form in other interarc basins. This is because the tectonic and volcanic processes which controlled sedimentation in the Cagayan basin also affect other arc systems and will therefore control or significantly influence volcaniclastic sedimentation in other interarc basins.

Instead, most researchers have relied on qualitative descriptions or the evaluation of nonmetric characters, which in many cases display continuous variation. Also, only a few studies have used quantitative data to formally test hypotheses regarding the taxonomic composition of the ""erectus"" hypodigm. Despite these previous analyses, however, and perhaps in part due to these varied approaches for assessing variation within specimens typically referred to H. erectus (sensu lato) and the general lack of rigorous statistical testing of how variation within this taxon is partitioned, there is currently little consensus regarding whether this group is a single species, or whether it should instead be split into separate temporal or geographically delimited taxa. In order to evaluate possible explanations for variation within H. erectus, we tested the general hypothesis that variation within the temporal bone morphology of H. erectus is consistent with that of a single species, using great apes and humans as comparative taxa. Eighteen three-dimensional (3D) landmarks of the temporal bone were digitized on a total of 520 extant and fossil hominid crania. Landmarks were registered by Generalized Procrustes Analysis, and Procrustes distances were calculated for comparisons of individuals within and between the extant taxa. Distances between fossil specimens and between a priori groupings of fossils were then compared to the distances calculated within the extant taxa to assess the variation within the H. erectus sample relative to that of known species, subspecies, and populations. Results of these analyses indicate that shape variation within the entire H. erectus sample is generally higher than extant hominid intraspecific variation, and putative H. ergaster specimens are significantly different from other specimens in H. erectus (sensu lato). However, shape distances within geographical groups of H. erectus are also high, and OH 9 and Dmanisi 2280 are morphologically distinct from the Koobi Fora specimens that are sometimes classified as H. ergaster. These findings suggest that, although H. erectus may be composed of multiple species, the differentiation is complex, and specimens cannot easily be grouped geographically or chronologically. Consequently, more complicated scenarios seeking to explain the observed variation within H. erectus must be considered. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Southwest China has been identified from genetic research as a hotspot of human diversity, containing ancient mtDNA and Y-DNA lineages, and has yielded a number of human remains thought to derive from Pleistocene deposits. We have prepared, reconstructed, described and dated a new partial skull from a consolidated sediment block collected in 1979 from the site of Longlin Cave (Guangxi Province). We also undertook new excavations at Maludong (Yunnan Province) to clarify the stratigraphy and dating of a large sample of mostly undescribed human remains from the site. Methodology/Principal Findings: We undertook a detailed comparison of cranial, including a virtual endocast for the Maludong calotte, mandibular and dental remains from these two localities. Both samples probably derive from the same population, exhibiting an unusual mixture of modern human traits, characters probably plesiomorphic for later Homo, and some unusual features. We dated charcoal with AMS radiocarbon dating and speleothem with the Uranium-series technique and the results show both samples to be from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition: ~14.3-11.5 ka. Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis suggests two plausible explanations for the morphology sampled at Longlin Cave and Maludong. First, it may represent a late-surviving archaic population, perhaps paralleling the situation seen in North Africa as indicated by remains from Dar-es-Soltane and Temara, and maybe also in southern China at Zhirendong. Alternatively, East Asia may have been colonised during multiple waves during the Pleistocene, with the Longlin-Maludong morphology possibly reflecting deep population substructure in Africa prior to modern humans dispersing into Eurasia. © 2012 Curnoe et al.",,"Archean; article; Asian; bone age; China; dentition; evolution; geography; Holocene; human; human tissue; mandible; Pleistocene; plesiomorphy; radiometric dating; skull; stratigraphy; Aborigine; body size; Caucasian; Eskimo; face; fossil; histology; Negro; physiology; principal component analysis; skull; time; tooth crown; uranium; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biological Evolution; Body Size; China; Crowns; European Continental Ancestry Group; Face; Fossils; Geography; Humans; Inuits; Mandible; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Principal Component Analysis; Radiometric Dating; Skull; Time Factors; Uranium",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858178764

The paper focuses on two main themes: (1) the evidence for the changing nature of the human use of the cave and the implications of this evidence for wider debates in Southeast Asia regarding the foraging behaviors of the modern human populations who colonized the region in the later Pleistocene, and (2) the character of the later transition from foraging to farming. The first foragers visiting the caves ca. 45,000 years ago encountered much more varied landscapes than the present-day equatorial evergreen rainforest around Niah, though they were ones in which rainforest probably remained a component. A remarkable array of organic evidence indicates that the Pleistocene foragers using the caves exploited such landscapes with a combination of hunting, fishing, mollusk collection, and plant gathering, the latter including tuberous forest plants such as aroids, taro, yam, and sago, palm. In the mid Holocene, when the landscape surrounding the cave was more similar to that of today, the primary use of the caves was for burials: the West Mouth of the Great Cave in particular was the location for an elaborate Neolithic cemetery that was characterized by a considerable degree of formal planning through its ca. 2500-year life. However, Neolithic people may also have used the West Mouth for habitation, as they certainly used other entrances of the cave complex. Based on present evidence, their subsistence base appears to have been forest foraging, though they were in contact with rice farmers.

Many evolutionary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this short stature: adaptation to food limitations, climate, forest density, or high mortality rates. However, such hypotheses are difficult to test given the lack of long-term surveys and demographic data. Whether the short stature observed nowadays in African Pygmy populations as compared to their Non-Pygmy neighbors is determined by genetic factors remains widely unknown. Here, we study a uniquely large new anthropometrical dataset comprising more than 1,000 individuals from 10 Central African Pygmy and neighboring Non-Pygmy populations, categorized as such based on cultural criteria rather than height. We show that climate, or forest density may not play a major role in the difference in adult stature between existing Pygmies and Non-Pygmies, without ruling out the hypothesis that such factors played an important evolutionary role in the past. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between stature and neutral genetic variation in a subset of 213 individuals and found that the Pygmy individuals' stature was significantly positively correlated with levels of genetic similarity with the Non-Pygmy gene-pool for both men and women. Overall, we show that a Pygmy individual exhibiting a high level of genetic admixture with the neighboring Non-Pygmies is likely to be taller. These results show for the first time that the major morphological difference in stature found between Central African Pygmy and Non-Pygmy populations is likely determined by genetic factors.

It evaluates the geomorphological context of the site within the known pattern of rapid late Quaternary climate change. Attention is given to the proximity to the sea and the likelihood of humid tropical or cooler drier conditions. The stratigraphic succession is described and four units or lithofacies (2C, 2, 3 and 4) are recognized as being of particular geomorphological and archaeological importance. The key processes operating within the site are the accumulation and subsequent failure and flow of bat and bird guano, hillslope colluviation, and ephemeral stream flow and pond development. Units 2C and 2 contain the critical archaeology, including the Deep Skull from an anatomically modern human, discovered by Tom Harrisson. These were formed by colluviation from a complex cave-mouth rampart and stream flow from within the cave. The stream transported fine-grained sediment to a shallow pond, and both the stream and pond deposits show evidence for prolonged desiccation. Human activity is associated with these surfaces. The human remains and related archaeology are preserved because a mudflow (Unit 3) plowed into and overrode the land surface upon which the humans had lived, resulting in the deformation and burial of the surface and the preservation of the archaeological material. Provisional radiocarbon dates indicate that Units 2C and 2 accumulated from before ca. 45,000 B.P. until ca. 38,000 B.P. Dates bracketing the Deep Skull give this an age of ca. 45,000 B.P. to ca. 43,000 B.P. Overlying the mudflow, Unit 4, a silty diamicton with a relatively high carbonate and organic content, appears to have formed by a mix of natural colluvial and human transport processes, and is associated with human cultural material. Unpublished radiocarbon dates indicate that this deposit formed from before ca. 19,500 B.P. to ca. 8500 B.P. (uncalibrated). This interpretation of the site and its finds has required detailed reconstruction of the changing palaeogeography within and beyond the cave entrance and the nature and rate of geomorphological processes operating within the region, which have been placed within models for rapid Quaternary environmental change. The results suggest that during the earlier period of human presence in the Great Cave of Niah (earlier than ca. 45,000 B.P. until ca. 38,000 B.P.), the climate was episodically wet with much longer periods of relative dryness. During the later period of human occupancy (ca. 19,500 B.P. to ca. 8500 B.P. [uncalibrated]), the evidence is less secure and a slightly moister climate is suggested. © 2005 by the University of Hawai'i Press.","Ancient humans; Bioturbation; Borneo; Cave; Climatic change; Coastal change; Geoarchaeology; Geomorphology; Guano; Niah; Rainforest; Sarawak; Site formation processes; Sunda; Tropics","archaeological evidence; environmental change; human settlement; paleoclimate; Asia; East Malaysia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Malaysia; Niah Caves; Sarawak; Southeast Asia; World; Aves",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-24344506082

[""Growth rates and life histories in twenty-two small-scale societies,"" Am. J. Hum. Biol. 18:295311 (2006)] used life history theory to develop an innovative explanation for human diversity in stature. Short stature could have been selected for in some human populations as a result of the advantage of an earlier growth cessation and earlier reproduction in a context of high mortality. Migliano et al. [""Life history trade-offs explain the evolution of human pygmies,"" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104:20,21620,219 (2007)] recently published an important article that tested this hypothesis to explain short stature in human pygmy populations. However innovative this work may be, we believe that some of the data and results presented are controversial if not questionable. As problematic points we note (1) the use of an arbitrary threshold of height (155 cm) to categorize populations into pygmies and nonpygmies; (2) the use of demographic data from Philippine pygmy groups that have experienced dramatic cultural and environmental changes in the last 20 years, and (3) the use of demographic data concerning African pygmy groups because good systematic data on these groups are not available. Finally, we report here mathematical errors and loopholes in the optimization model developed by Migliano and colleagues. In this paper we suggest alternative trade-offs that can be used to explain Migliano's results on more reliable bases. © 2010 Wayne State University Press.","Demography; Fertility; Height; Life history; Mortality; Pygmies","Africa; animal; anthropometry; article; Asian; biodiversity; biological model; body height; demography; evolution; fertility; genetics; human; life; Negro; Philippines; reference value; Africa; African Continental Ancestry Group; Animals; Anthropometry; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Body Height; Demography; Fertility; Humans; Life; Models, Biological; Philippines; Reference Values",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952980147

Driven from evolved Homo erectus to archaic Homo sapiens, for a long time Solo man did not find a real place in taxonomy and in the scientific debate, whereas Neandertal is still famous for its cultural or biological struggle against the ancestors of modern humans. Are there two human evolutionary trends: one in Europe with its first inhabitants over 1.3. Ma that became Neandertals, and another one in Asia, where human fossils are assessed to be older than 1.5. Ma? In 1932, Oppenoorth described Homo (Javanthropus) soloensis from the skull series gathered from the deposits of the Solo River. Since that time, some authors followed the point of view that this series belong to archaic Homo sapiens, but most paleoanthropologists considered them as evolved Homo erectus.To take stock of the taxonomy of Indonesian Homo erectus, three independent approaches and the authors' research done using different techniques and methods were compared. Considering the studies separately undertaken on Homo erectus (Brain structure analyses, 3D morphometry study, cladistic analysis performed from a biometric and morphological database), two categories existed. As far as a chronological gap splits these two categories, this reappraisal of Homo erectus poses the question of the possible occurrence of two different species. This question is still debated among the authors, but the convergent point of view brings new light on the multi-regionalism hypothesis within Homo. This Asian point of view sheds light on the older European evidence of human inhabitants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"evolution; hominid; morphology; morphometry; taxonomy; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956058623

However, the origins and affinities of these groups remain unresolved. Negritos are characterized by their short stature, dark skin color, and wiry hair, and they inhabit the Philippines, Malay Peninsula, and the Andaman Islands. Among Philippine Negritos, the Batak are of particular interest in understanding population interactions in the region due to their location on Palawan Island, which likely formed a corridor by which human migrations entered the rest of the Philippine archipelago from Island SEA. Here, we extend current understanding of the distribution of genetic diversity in Negritos by presenting the first analysis of mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome diversity among the Batak. We show that the Batak are genetically distinct from Negritos of the Andaman Islands and Malay Peninsula and instead bear most resemblance to geographically proximate Philippine Negritos and to non-Negrito populations from the Philippines and Island SEA. An extensive degree of recent admixture between the Batak and their neighbors is indicated by the high frequency of recently coalescing haplogroups in the Batak that are found throughout Island SEA. The comparison of results from these two loci further lends support to the hypothesis that male-biased admixture has, in particular, been a prominent feature of the interactions between the Batak and surrounding non-Negrito populations.

The study of knapped stones in the Philippines dates back to the 1920s. At this time, stone tools were used as type fossils to propose an initial chronology of prehistoric cultures. Later, taxonomies and functional analyses were used to assess lithic assemblages until the end of the 1990s.

Three dentaries dated to the Late Pleistocene, between ca. 50,000 and 68,000 BP, are referred to the genera Batomys and Apomys; the former is a member of the endemic ""Phloeomys Division"" of Philippine murids, and the latter of the ""Chrotomys Division,"" also endemic to the Philippines. Batomys is currently known from five extant species from Luzon, Mindanao, and Dinagat islands; the two species known from Luzon differ in size and dental and mandibular morphology from the two fossil mandibles, and both occur only at elevations above 1350 m. Apomys is currently known from two subgenera on Luzon; the fossil is a member of the nominate subgenus, which contains two species on Luzon, one of which, Apomys microdon, is conspecific with one fossil. We hypothesize that the Batomys fossils represent a different species from the living taxa, but we do not name it due to the fragmentary nature of the specimens. These Apomys and Batomys represent the first fossil small mammals from the main body of the Philippine archipelago (east of Huxley's Line), and the Batomys are the first suspected extinct Pleistocene small mammal from the Philippines. The fossils indicate greater species richness and broader distributions than at present within this distinctive and diverse endemic radiation of mammals. © Biological Society of Washington.","dentary bones; endemism; fossil rodents; murid morphology","archipelago; cave; endemic species; endemism; extinction; fossil record; geographical distribution; morphology; new record; paleobiology; Pleistocene; rodent; species richness; taxonomy; valley; Cagayan; Cagayan Valley; Callao Cave; Luzon; Philippines; Apomys; Apomys microdon; Batomys; Chrotomys; Mammalia; Muridae; Phloeomys; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053996305

In order to obtain a robust reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Andamanese, we carried out a study on the three aboriginal populations, namely, the Great Andamanese, Onge and Nicobarese, using autosomal microsatellite markers. The range of alleles (7-31.2) observed in the studied population and heterozygosity values (0.392-0.857) indicate that the selected STR markers are highly polymorphic in all the three populations, and genetic variability within the populations is significantly high, with a mean gene diversity of 77%. The Andaman ""Negrito"" populations do not show particular affinities either with the African populations or with the Indian populations, confirming their unique origin. In contrast, Nicobarese show close affinities with the Southeast Asian populations, suggesting their recent entry in the Islands. © The Japan Society of Human Genetics and Springer-Verlag 2006.","Andamanese; Autosomes; Enigmatic tribes; Microsatellites; Nicobarese; Onge; STRs","mitochondrial DNA; Aborigine; Africa; allele; article; autosomal inheritance; ethnic group; evolution; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic isolation by distance; genetic variability; heterozygosity; human; India; microsatellite marker; migration; phylogeny; South Asia; Southeast Asia; African Continental Ancestry Group; Alleles; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; India; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748658026

The geometric morphometric methods were applied to the skulls of 18 specimen Asian fossils dated 6,000 to 1,150,000 years. Landmarks were analyzed by Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical classification methods (UPGMA and NJ) were applied to those samples in order to identify homogenous subgroups. The Mahalanobis distances between those subgroups have been calculated. Two phylogenetic analyses have been applied to the quantitative characters: the maximum likelihood approach and a cladistic analysis. A sample of gorilla and chimpanzees was used as the out-group. Classification and PCA analysis identified 2 subgroups in the fossil group: one with an Homo sapiens affinity and the other with an Homo erectus affinity. Both phylogenetic analyses identified Homo erectus as a monophyletic subgroup, but the fossil subgroup with an Homo sapiens affinity are scattered among the extant Homo sapiens. We finally concluded that the fossils belong to 2 different taxa. The first (fossil Homo sapiens) belong to the same taxon than extant Homo sapiens, and the second is attributed to Homo erectus. © 2010 Société d'anthropologie de Paris et Springer-Verlag France.","Asia; Cladistic; Geometric morphometric; Homo erectus; Phenetic; Phylogeny",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873247764
