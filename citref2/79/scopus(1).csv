The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.",,"animal; article; biological model; biometry; evolution; frog; genetics; phylogeny; Animals; Biometry; Evolution; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Ranidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023375195

However, it is well known that more complex evolutionary scenarios are poorly described by such models. Further, even when evolution proceeds in a tree-like manner, analysis of the data may not be best served by using methods that enforce a tree structure but rather by a richer visualization of the data to evaluate its properties, at least as an essential first step. Thus, phylogenetic networks should be employed when reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, recombination, or gene duplication and loss are believed to be involved, and, even in the absence of such events, phylogenetic networks have a useful role to play. This article reviews the terminology used for phylogenetic networks and covers both split networks and reticulate networks, how they are defined, and how they can be interpreted. Additionally, the article outlines the beginnings of a comprehensive statistical framework for applying split network methods. We show how split networks can represent confidence sets of trees and introduce a conservative statistical test for whether the conflicting signal in a network is treelike. Finally, this article describes a new program, SplitsTree4, an interactive and comprehensive tool for inferring different types of phylogenetic networks from sequences, distances, and trees. © The Author 2005.

Graphical display techniques include an automatic collection of elementary graphics corresponding to groups of rows or to columns in the data table, thus providing a very efficient way for automatic k-table graphics and geographical mapping options. A dynamic graphic module allows interactive operations like searching, zooming, selection of points, and display of data values on factor maps.

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Canonical variate analysis; Linear discriminant function; Ordination; Principal component analysis; Procrustes; Selection gradient",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952312407

The results have been synthesized through a diachronic map, whose chronological phases are related to socio-economic and cultural human evolution. The house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) progression in the Mediterranean begins with a quick but limited diffusion in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin achieved around the 8th millennium BC. Until the 1st millennium BC, the invasive process seems to have stopped or drastically slowed, despite the increasing opportunities of passive transport during the Bronze Age. During the 1st millennium BC, there was mass colonization by the house mouse of the entire Western Mediterranean Basin and Northern Europe. We propose to explain this chronological gap in the colonization of the Eastern and Western Mediterranean using source-sink theory considering that the western environments acted like sinks until the first millennium BC. At that time the Western Mediterranean was fully opened to Eastern influences and migrations, and the human pressures on the environment drastically increased. This may have favoured definitively the adaptation of the house mouse to the Western commensal niches. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London.","Anthropization; Coevolution; Invasive species; Phylogeography; Source-sink; Subfossils","Bronze Age; coevolution; new record; phylogeography; source-sink dynamics; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; oceanic regions; World; Mus musculus",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-15944428237

The goals of the present study were to (1) test the proposal that these Scandinavian musculus mice arose by a series of founder and island‐hopping events from one or a few populations near the domesticus‐musculus hybrid zone on the East Holstein Peninsula of northern Germany and (2) see whether more than the two types of domesticus mtDNA detected by restriction analysis existed among these musculus populations. Sequences of the 1 ‐kilobase mtDNA segment encompassing the entire control region and the flanking tRNAs were gathered from 217 domesticus and musculus mice. Included were 104‐mice from 12 localities across a 120‐km transect of the Holstein hybrid and adjacent zones, 56 animals from 12 localities in the musculus range of Scandinavia, 56 domesticus mice representing 46 localities in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas, and one musculus mouse from Czechoslovakia. Save for the Czech mouse, all individuals had domesticus mtDNA, a total of 56 types being resolved and 10 of these being found among the Holstein mice. Electrophoresis of proteins encoded by nuclear loci along with assessment of external morphology and of skeletal, cranial, and dental traits revealed a transition from domesticus to musculus nuclear genomes over a distance of about 20–40 km in East Holstein. Of the 216 mtDNAs, 149 fall into a clade of 17 types characterized by the addition of an 11‐bp direct repeat; included are all Swedish, Finnish, and northern Danish mtDNAs as well as 82 from the Holstein transect. Support for the previously proposed migration pathway from the European mainland to Scandinavia came from finding that on the domesticus side of the hybrid zone in Holstein a high proportion of mice carry the types of mtDNA found in the mice with musculus nuclear genomes. Sequencing revealed 11 different mtDNAs in the +11‐bp clade among musculus mice, one of these being widespread, seven others being confined to single localities, and one Danish collecting locality yielding five types. The mitochondrial diversity uncovered among these mice leads to a reexamination of some aspects of the original model, notably with respect to the number of founding females, the possible role of selection, and the possibility of an accelerated rate of mtDNA evolution. This study also showed that for the mouse control region the transition/ transversion ratio is significantly lower than for the human control region and that small length mutations occur about as frequently as transversions during mouse control region evolution. Control region and flanking tRNA sequences were obtained from 21 7 European commensal house mice, especially Scandinavian and East Holstein Mus musculus that carry only Mus domesticus mtDNA. Among the 56 types of domesticus mtDNA identified, 17 types, collectively representing 149 mice, have an added 1 1‐bp repeat; 11 types in the + 1 1‐bp clade were found among musculus mice. Finding + 11‐bp mtDNAs also in many East Holstein domesticus mice supports the model that the Scandinavian musculus mice arose by a series of island‐hopping events from near the domesticus‐musculus hybrid zone on the East Holstein Peninsula of northern Germany, while the mtDNA diversity detected encourages reexamination of ideas about the number of founding females and the role of selection. The nuclear and cytological genotypes of 104 animals collected from 12 localities along a 120‐km transect through the East Holstein hybrid zone were characterized by electrophoresis of proteins at three diagnostic loci, assessment of several morphological traits, and karyotyping. These studies reveal a transition from domesticus to musculus nuclear genomes over about 20–40 km, differential penetration of domesticus alleles into musculus territory, and no Robertsonian translocations. The number of tail vertebrae provided a new assessment of species differences, with more vertebrae identified as the osteological basis for the longer tails characteristic of M. domesticus.

Although all of these mice bear the nuclear genes of Mus musculus, they bear the mtDNA of M. domesticus exclusively. Yet, some of the Swedish localities are 750 km away from the hybrid zone between these two species. Furthermore, only one type of mtDNA was found at the seven Swedish localities; this type was found before at an eighth locality in Sweden as well as in Jutland north of the hybrid zone. The apparent lack of mtDNA divergence in the mouse population of Sweden contrasts with the extensive divergence usually found within other geographic areas in Europe, Africa and North America. Electrophoretic analysis of proteins encoded by nuclear genes indicates that the Swedish mice have lower average heterozygosity than Danish and Central European populations of musculus mice. These findings lead us to suggest that the source of the commensal mouse population in Sweden was a small propagule that originated from a population situated only a few kilometres to the east of the point at which the hybrid zone on the European mainland meets the Baltic Sea, namely on East Holstein. Such a founder event may have been associated with the spread of farming from north Germany into Sweden about 4000 years ago. © 1987, Cambridge University Press.

We address this by studying a sample from the southeastern tip of the Fertile Crescent in the Iranian province of Ahvaz. Including other published and unpublished data from France, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Turkey and other places in Iran, altogether 321 mitochondrial D-loop sequences are simultaneously analysed. The patterns of coalescence obtained corroborate the classical proposal according to which the Fertile Crescent is where commensalism with humans has started in the Western Hemisphere, and from where the subspecies has expanded further west. Our data also clearly show that despite multiple colonisations and long-range transportation, there is still a rather high ΦST of 0.39. The original expansion signal is still recognisable, with two well-separated derived clades, allowing us to propose a hypothetical scenario in which expansion toward Europe and Asia Minor took at least two routes, tentatively termed the Mediterranean and the Bosphorus/Black Sea routes. This scenario resembles that of another domesticated species, the goat, and fits with the known progression of Neolithic culture. Given the concomitance of both phenomena around 12 000 years ago, we propose a recalibration of the D-loop mutation rate to a much faster tick of ∼40% per site per million years (Myr). This value should be used for intrasubspecific polymorphism, while the interspecific rate in Mus is presently estimated at 6-10%/site/Myr. This is in keeping with the now well recognised fact that only a subfraction of segregating mutations go to fixation. © 2007 The Authors.","D-loop; Fertile Crescent; Mitochondrial DNA coalescence; Mus musculus domesticus; Postglacial colonization","mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; chemistry; classification; Europe; genetic variability; genetics; geography; Iran; molecular genetics; mouse; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; population genetics; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Europe; Genetics, Population; Geography; Iran; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Variation (Genetics); Capra hircus; Ixodida; Mus musculus; Mus musculus domesticus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149012877

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

We examine how climate change may have affected the availability of food plants and their cultivation in northern Syria at the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene. Charred plant remains from sites representing 11 archaeological levels indicate that during the late Pleistocene rye was commonly used, together with seeds gathered from the floodplain. During the early Holocene, rye and floodplain plants go out of use and barley then emmer wheat become common, pulses, lentils, peas and vetches increase in use and figs, chickpeas and horse beans were introduced. Pre-domestic cultivation is difficult to identify in the absence of morphologically domesticated plants. We cannot identify precisely when cultivation started but the possibility of cultivation is not excluded for the late Pleistocene, however we argue that it did not become a reliable means of subsistence until the Holocene. This period coincides with a decrease in the amplitude of climatic oscillations and global warming. With these conditions, combined with an increase in rainfall, we suggest cultivation developed into a sustainable economy. The earliest morphologically domestic cereals found in this area date to about 10 000 cal. yr BP. These may have been slow to become established because seed for sowing may have occasionally been replenished from the wild. © 2009 SAGE Publications.","Climate; Cultivation; Holocene; Syria; Wild cereals.; Younger Dryas","archaeology; climate conditions; climate oscillation; cultivation; emergence; Holocene; Pleistocene; warming; Asia; Eurasia; Middle East; Syrian Arab Republic; Canavalia ensiformis; Cicer arietinum; Hordeum; Lens culinaris; Pisum sativum; Secale cereale; Triticum aestivum; Triticum dicoccon; Vicia faba",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-68049129846

This pattern is in keeping with the two-step westward expansion proposed by zooarchaeological data, an early one coincident with the Neolithic progression and limited to the eastern Mediterranean and a later one, particularly evident in the western Mediterranean, related to the generalization of maritime trade during the first millennium BC and onwards.

This means that the phylogeography of M. m. domesticus should reflect patterns of human movements. We studied restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequence variations in mouse mitochondrial (mt) DNA throughout the British Isles (328 mice from 105 localities, including previously published data). There is a major mtDNA lineage revealed by both RFLP and sequence analyses, which is restricted to the northern and western peripheries of the British Isles, and also occurs in Norway. This distribution of the 'Orkney' lineage fits well with the sphere of influence of the Norwegian Vikings and was probably generated through inadvertent transport by them. To form viable populations, house mice would have required large human settlements such as the Norwegian Vikings founded. The other parts of the British Isles (essentially most of mainland Britain) are characterized by house mice with different mtDNA sequences, some of which are also found in Germany, and which probably reflect both Iron Age movements of people and mice and earlier development of large human settlements.

Following their recent expansion in Europe, two subspecies of the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus) have formed a hybrid zone maintained by hybrid incompatibilities and possibly behavioural reinforcement, offering a good model of incipient speciation. We reconstruct the history of their divergence using an approximate Bayesian computation framework and sequence variation at 57 autosomal loci. We find support for a long isolation period preceding the advent of gene flow around 200 000 generations ago, much before the formation of the European hybrid zone a few thousand years ago. The duration of the allopatric episode appears long enough (74% of divergence time) to explain the accumulation of many post-zygotic incompatibilities expressed in the present hybrid zone. The ancient contact inferred could have played a role in mating behaviour divergence and laid the ground for further reinforcement. We suggest that both subspecies originally colonized the Middle East from the northern Indian subcontinent, domesticus settling on the shores of the Persian Gulf and musculus on those of the Caspian Sea. Range expansions during interglacials would have induced secondary contacts, presumably in Iran, where they must have also interacted with Mus musculus castaneus. Future studies should incorporate this possibility, and we point to Iran and its surroundings as a hot spot for house mouse diversity and speciation studies. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","allopatry; approximate Bayesian computation; gene flow; isolation; mouse; speciation","allele; animal; article; Bayes theorem; biological model; classification; computer simulation; DNA sequence; Europe; gene flow; gene locus; genetic variability; genetics; hybridization; Indian Ocean; Iran; methodology; Middle East; molecular genetics; mouse; nucleotide sequence; phylogeography; sequence alignment; species difference; species differentiation; Alleles; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Computer Simulation; Europe; Gene Flow; Genetic Loci; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Hybridization, Genetic; Indian Ocean; Iran; Mice; Middle East; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeography; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Mus musculus; Mus musculus castaneus; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus musculus musculus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955239986

Recently, a phylogenetic survey has shown that the non-commensal mouse of Cyprus was an unknown sister species of European wild mice. Here, we describe this new species of the genus Mus (Rodentia, Mammalia), namely Mus cypriacus sp. n., based on 19 specimens trapped in the southern part of Cyprus. These animals were first compared to Eurasian species of mice using both molecular genet-ics (complete D-loop sequences and nuclear gene intron) and cytogenetics to state on its systematic status. Then classical and geometric morphometric analyses on both cranial and dental characters have been performed to compare Mus cypriacus with circum-Mediterranean species and provide diagnositic morphological characters. Genetic data strongly support a sister species relationship of the new species to M. macedonicus, the closest mainland taxon. Morphometric analyses provide satisfying criteria for diagnosis of this species relative to other Mediterranean species. The most obvious phenotypic characteristics are its long tail and the allometric gigantism and shape robustness of its cranial and dental characters compared to other Mediterranean mice. The molecular clock and the history of the murine settlement on Cyprus are congruent and suggest that the common ancestor of M. cypriacus and M. macedonicus arrived on Cyprus during the Middle Pleistocene by a founder event on natural raft. The remoteness of Cyprus through time has prevented introgression from the mainland gene pool, and favoured phenotypic adaptation to competition release, leading to the allopatric speciation of M. cypriacus.

MtDNA D-loop sequences of the mice revealed a complex phylogeography within M. m. domesticus, reflecting passive human transport to Norway, probably during the Viking period. M. m. musculus may have colonized earlier. If so, that leaves open the possibility that M. m. domesticus replaced M. m. musculus from much of Norway, with the widely distributed hybrids a relict of this process.

Previous studies have linked the distribution of house mouse mitochondrial (mt) DNA clades to areas formerly occupied by the Norwegian Vikings in Norway and the British Isles. Norwegian Viking activity also extended further westwards in the North Atlantic with the settlement of Iceland, short-lived colonies in Greenland and a fleeting colony in Newfoundland in 1000 AD. Here we investigate whether house mouse mtDNA sequences reflect human history in these other regions as well. Results: House mice samples from Iceland, whether from archaeological Viking Age material or from modern-day specimens, had an identical mtDNA haplotype to the clade previously linked with Norwegian Vikings. From mtDNA and microsatellite data, the modern-day Icelandic mice also share the low genetic diversity shown by their human hosts on Iceland. Viking Age mice from Greenland had an mtDNA haplotype deriving from the Icelandic haplotype, but the modern-day Greenlandic mice belong to an entirely different mtDNA clade. We found no genetic association between modern Newfoundland mice and the Icelandic/ancient Greenlandic mice (no ancient Newfoundland mice were available). The modern day Icelandic and Newfoundland mice belong to the subspecies M. m. domesticus, the Greenlandic mice to M. m. musculus. Conclusions: In the North Atlantic region, human settlement history over a thousand years is reflected remarkably by the mtDNA phylogeny of house mice. In Iceland, the mtDNA data show the arrival and continuity of the house mouse population to the present day, while in Greenland the data suggest the arrival, subsequent extinction and recolonization of house mice - in both places mirroring the history of the European human host populations. If house mice arrived in Newfoundland with the Viking settlers at all, then, like the humans, their presence was also fleeting and left no genetic trace. The continuity of mtDNA haplotype in Iceland over 1000 years illustrates that mtDNA can retain the signature of the ancestral house mouse founders. We also show that, in terms of genetic variability, house mouse populations may also track their host human populations. © 2012 Jones et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"ancestry; colonization; commensal; evolutionary biology; extinction; genetic variation; Holocene; hominid; human settlement; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeny; phylogeography; recolonization; rodent; settlement history; subspecies; zoogeography; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Greenland; Iceland; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Mus; Mus musculus; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; Canada; genetic variability; genetics; Greenland; history; human; Iceland; migration; mouse; phylogeny; population migration; species difference; Animal Migration; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Genetic Variation; Greenland; History, 15th Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Iceland; Mice; Microsatellite Repeats; Newfoundland and Labrador; Phylogeny; Species Specificity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858324626

This success is due to its commensal interaction with humans, which have allowed it to reach and thrive in places outside its natural bounds. Although the Neolithic revolution – i.e. the birth of a new way of life based on agriculture and husbandry – is accepted as a key factor in the evolution of the house mouse (Tchernov, 1984, 1991a, b, 1993; Auffray et al., 1990c; Cucchi et al., 2005), the components of the interaction between human evolution, the dynamics of change in mouse synanthropy, and the invasion process of the house mouse are still poorly understood (Cucchi and Vigne, 2006). This is mainly because the information documenting the beginning of the process is hidden within the archaeological sites where early farming societies emerge at the beginning of the Holocene (Cucchi et al., 2005). These zooarchaeological remains represent the best source of biological information for understanding the factors in the interaction of cultural and natural systems that led to the increased synanthropy and range of the house mouse. Despite this importance, these remains are still rarely collected and even less often studied.Being able to date the onset of house mouse synanthropy and invasion has implications for evolutionary biologists working on the diversification of the commensal subspecies, their phylogeny and their hybridization, and the processes shaping the biodiversity we observe today. This is especially obvious since we know that human-induced biological invasion is one of the main factors in biodiversity erosion (Palumbi, 2001). Furthermore, the history of house mouse synanthropy is a key component in the reconstruction of the history of human health. Indeed, commensals like mice and rats, once in contact with humans, brought a brand new array of pathogens into the human environment (Shlyakhov, 1983). Therefore, the onset of rodent synanthropy has played a major role in the epidemiology of human infectious diseases. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,Book,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871754775

This geographic pattern of variation reflects range expansions or contractions through time, and therefore phylogeography aims at elucidating the colonization/contraction history of organisms by using molecular tools. Gene lineages (or ‘phylogroups’) are defined and the primary analysis involves geographical mapping of these phylogroups, sublineages, and individual haplotypes, determining genetic diversities in phylogeographic units and geographic areas, and using methods to age phylogeographic units and demographic events. Much phylogeographic analysis has been directed at elucidating the natural colonization history of organisms since the Last Glacial Maximum, when the ranges of temperate species were restricted to glacial refugia from which range expansions occurred with the amelioration of climate (Hewitt, 2000). By inferring what happened to separate lineages within species, it is possible to build up a picture of the species–wide colonization history, from the location of probable glacial refugia to the limits of the range expansions. Of course, the molecular records tend to be more complex when they include the impact of several successive glacial events. The phylogeography of most members of the genus Mus fits into this typical framework, although few species other than the house mouse have been under phylogeographic scrutiny over their complete range. We can cite as exceptions Mus spretus and M. macedonicus (Boursot et al., 1984; Macholán et al., 2007). For most other species in the genus, available information primarily concerns phylogeny and broad distribution (see, for example, Suzuki and Aplin, Chapter 2 in this volume) but hardly more. However, the house mouse (M. musculus) has a more complex phylogeography because of the involvement of humans in its colonization history. There has been much work directed at this history of the house mouse in conjunction with humans and we will focus this chapter on that aspect. However, it is important to see this in the context of the earlier pre-human phase, which we will review first. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925614150

The subspecies occur parapatrically in a region considered to be the cradle of the species in Southern Asia ('central region'), as well as in the rest of the world ('peripheral region'). The morphological evolution of this species in a phylogeographical context is studied using a landmark-based approach on mandible morphology of different populations of the three lineages. The morphological variation increases from central to peripheral regions at the population and subspecific levels, confirming a centrifugal sub-speciation within this species. Furthermore, the outgroup comparison with sister species suggests that M.musculus musculus and populations of all subspecies inhabiting the Iranian plateau have retained a more ancestral mandible morphology, suggesting that this region may represent one of the relevant places of the origin of the species. Mus musculus castaneus, both from central and peripheral regions, is morphologically the most variable and divergent subspecies. Finally, the results obtained in the present study suggest that the independent evolution to commensalism in the three lineages is not accompanied by a convergence detectable on jaw morphology. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","Commensalism; M.musculus castaneus; M.musculus domesticus; M.musculus musculus; Morphometrics; Origin","commensalism; evolutionary biology; morphometry; parapatry; peripheral region; phylogeography; rodent; subspecies; Iranian Plateau; Muridae; Mus musculus; Mus musculus castaneus; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus musculus musculus; Rodentia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856450974

We investigate the phylogeography of house mice in northern France and the British Isles (particularly Ireland and the Scottish islands) using microsatellite data and mitochondrial (mt) control region sequences from modern and museum material, placing these in a Europe-wide context. The majority of mtDNA sequences from northern France belong to a clade widespread across the British mainland and Germany, supporting an earlier suggestion that this clade distribution represents colonization by house mice in the Iron Age. The presence of the clade in south-western Ireland indicates possible Iron Age colonization there as well. However, the majority of the Irish sequences belong to a clade elsewhere associated with Norwegian Viking activity, and likely represent the main wave of house mouse colonization of Ireland, arriving from the Scottish islands during the Viking period and linked to urbanization. The St Kilda sequences (from 100-year-old museum samples of the extinct form 'Mus muralis' of Barrett-Hamilton) and sequences from South Uist and Lewis also belong to this clade. The clustering of populations shown by the microsatellite data is distinctly different from the mtDNA phylogeny, with populations grouping by geographic proximity, possibly reflecting the genetic effects of secondary colonization. When the mtDNA sequence data are placed in a Europe-wide context, it is clear that the distributions of the two prevalent clades from the vicinity of the British Isles are essentially limited to north-western Europe. These two clades show no evidence of expansion through central Europe, and may therefore reflect maritime colonization. © 2010 The Authors.

The anecdotal find of the small murine (mice and rats) mandible among the wealthy cargo of the Uluburun shipwreck provide us with an unexpected opportunity to directly evidence the species associated with this stowaway and provide indirect clues regarding the ship's route. Taxonomic identification and geographic sourcing has been performed using outline molar shape analysis by Elliptic Fourier Transform comparing the Uluburun mouse molar phenotype with extant populations from eastern Mediterranean sibling species. Results showed that the mandible belonged to the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) with significant phenotypic similarities with extant Syrian house mouse populations. These results provide the earliest direct evidence for stowaway transports highlighting the historical process of the house mouse invasion of the Mediterranean. Using modern behavioural comparisons, combined with archaeological and historical sources, it has been argued that the servicing port of Ugarit (Minet el Beida) was a likely step on the vessel's last journey. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Mice remains collected from a Chalcolithic burnt house in southern Romania, provided a unique opportunity to document which of the two house mouse subspecies was the commensal taxa of the late Neolithic Romania and question the factors of its invasive process. To obtain the subspecific status of the Mus remains, we performed molar shape analysis with geometric morphometrics, using 160 specimens sampling the extant Eastern European Mus taxa as modern comparatives. Along with an overwhelming majority of eastern house mice (Mus musculus musculus) living constantly in the Chalcolithic house, indigenous small mammals (common hamster, field mice, voles and white toothed shrews) were also occupying the settlement sporadically, highlighting the antiquity of the synanthropisation of European small mammals. This secured occurrence of the eastern house mouse in late Neolithic Romania, led us to propose two testable research hypotheses: first, an eastern house mouse commensalism center in Eastern Europe happening during the sixth millennium BC, when neolithization reached the natural distribution of free living populations of Mus musculus musculus in the Pontic steppes of Ukraine; second, new trajectories of trading networks, stimulated by copper metallurgy around the fifth millennium BC, having allowed long-distance translocation of the commensal eastern house mouse from Eastern to Southern Europe Neolithic settlements. © SAGE Publications 2011.","commensalism; geometric morphometrics; Neolithic; synanthropisation; teeth; zooarchaeology","archaeology; commensalism; geometry; invasiveness; metallurgy; morphometry; Neolithic; rodent; settlement history; steppe; subspecies; tooth; Romania; Ukraine",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82855163897

These data were for the first time ever combined into a single database by unification of nomenclature of 21 loci examined by different authors in 39 populations. Analysis of geographical allele distribution have shown that populations of domestic Transcaucasian mice are close to Indo-Pakistani populations of form oriental of the species M. castaneus, which preserved a high level of ancestral polymorphism. We concluded that a very heterogeneous, rich gene pool of house mice from Transcaucasia could not develop only by secondary contacts of differentiated M. musculus s. str. and M. domesticus forms, since it is similar to the ancestral gene pool of the superspecies complexes M. musculus and M. spicilegus. In this context, unique characteristics of some Central Asian populations were examined; these populations may have served as a ""transit station"" in the dispersal of commensal house mice forms. We suggest that the Transcaucasian populations are genealogically closely related to an early Near East form of M. musculus, which, as M. domesticus and M. castaneus, split from the common ancestor and preserved nondifferentiated pool of ancestral alleles of protein genes. This hypothesis admits the involvement of differentiated species M. musculus s. str. and M. domesticus in the ultimate formation of the gene pool of Transcaucasian house mice. Apparently, these populations resulted from alternation and (or) ""overlapping"" of different evolutionary processes. A scenario suggesting that hybrid events having occurred in Transcaucasia at different times, were ""superposed"" on the gene pool of the ancient autochtonous population of house mice from this region seems most plausible. Analysis of allozyme variability in the modern Transcaucasian Mus populations could not always distinguish between ancestral polymorphism and hybridization consequences.",,"allele; article; controlled study; Cuba; data base; Eastern Europe; genealogy; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; geography; hybridization; medical literature; Middle East; molecular evolution; mouse; mutation; nonhuman; species differentiation; Western Europe; Mus; Mus musculus; Mus spicilegus; Musculus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-4544376819
