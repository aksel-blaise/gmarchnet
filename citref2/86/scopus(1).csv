George Williams's famous argument in favor of the Darwinists struck a powerful blow to those in opposing camps. His Adaptation and Natural Selection, now a classic of science literature, is a thorough and convincing essay in defense of Darwinism; its suggestions for developing effective principles for dealing with the evolution debate and its relevance to many fields outside biology ensure the timelessness of this critical work. © 1966 by Princeton University Press.

Modules are sets of traits that are internally integrated by interactions among traits, but are relatively independent from other modules. The interactions within modules rely on different mechanisms, depending on the context of a study. For morphological traits, modularity occurs in developmental, genetic, functional, and evolutionary contexts. A range of methods for quantifying integration and modularity in morphological data is available, and a number of comparative and experimental designs can be used to compare the different contexts. How development produces covariation between traits can have substantial implications for understanding genetic variation and the potential for evolutionary change, but research in this area has only begun and many questions remain unanswered.

Here we propose an approach that is based on mapping morphometric traits onto phylogenies derived from other data and thus avoids the pitfalls encountered by previous studies. This method treats shape as a single, multidimensional character. We propose a test for the presence of a phylogenetic signal in morphometric data, which simulates the null hypothesis of the complete absence of phylogenetic structure by permutation of the shape data among the terminal taxa. We also propose 2 measures of the fit of morphometric data to the phylogeny that are direct extensions of the consistency index and retention index used in traditional cladistics. We apply these methods to a small study of the evolution of wing shape in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, for which a very strongly supported phylogeny is available. This case study reveals a significant phylogenetic signal and a relatively low degree of homoplasy. Despite the low homoplasy, the shortest tree computed from landmark data on wing shape is inconsistent with the well-supported phylogenetic tree from molecular data, underscoring that morphometric data may not provide reliable information for inferring phylogeny.","Drosophilidae; Geometric morphometrics; Homoplasy; Phylogeny; Procrustes superposition; Shape; Squared-change parsimony","animal; article; biometry; classification; Drosophila; forelimb; genetics; histology; methodology; morphometrics; phylogeny; anatomy and histology; biometry; classification; Drosophila; forelimb; morphometrics; procedures; Animals; Biometry; Body Weights and Measures; Classification; Drosophila; Phylogeny; Wing; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophilidae; melanogaster subgroup; Animals; Biometry; Body Weights and Measures; Classification; Drosophila; Phylogeny; Wing",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950800361

The traditional model argues for an early use of the throwing spear followed by the spearthrower and bow and arrow. A major difficulty in testing this model is identifying the functional variables that characterize different weaponry. The evolution of prehistoric weaponry is reexamined here from an evolutionary perspective where projectile points are considered part of the complete weapon system and variation within that system is identified. The engineering of four weapon systems, the thrusting spear, throwing spear, spearthrower, and bow, are examined to identify those point variables that enhance the success of the system. These variables are then measured on a 9000-year sequence of projectile points from northwestern Wyoming to examine time/space patterns. The patterns reveal that the spearthrower was in use prior to 7500 years ago.","Engineering of primitive weaponry; Mummy Cave © 1998 plenum publishing corporation; Prehistoric weaponry; Projectile point; Weapon evolution",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-54649083999

I show that all these arguments are either false or illogical, and that the claim for increased early disparity is justified: (1) Taxonomie rank is an artifact, but no one has ever based a claim for greater disparity on this false criterion. (2) Cladistics can only deal with branching order, whereas disparity is a phenetic issue. These two legitimate aspects of evolutionary “relationship” are logically distinct. The rooting of a cladogram only illustrates monophyletic ancestry (which no one doubts, as we are not creationists), and cannot measure disparity. (3) The active stabilization of the differentia of Baupläne (for genetic and developmental reasons only dimly understood) provides a powerful rationale for weighting these characters in considerations of disparity; nothing had so stabilized in the Burgess fauna. If these differentia were steadily changing contingencies, rather than actively stabilized features with “deep” architectural status, then the retrospective argument would be justified. Although the three arguments are wrong, the claim for greater early disparity cannot be confidently established until we develop quantitative techniques for the characterization of morphospace and its differential filling through time. This is a dauntingly difficult problem, much harder than cladistic ordering, but not intractable. © 1991, Paleontological Society.

The point typology most widely employed in the Great Basin before about 1980 (the Berkeley typology) uses weight to distinguish larger dart points from smaller, but similarly shaped, arrow points. The typology commonly used today (the Monitor typology) uses basal width to distinguish wide-based dart points from narrow-based arrow points. The two typologies are in general agreement except in central Nevada, where some dart points are light, hence incorrectly typed by the Berkeley typology, and in eastern California, where some arrow points are wide-based, hence incorrectly typed by the Monitor typology. Scarce raw materials and resharpening may explain why dart points are sometimes light in central Nevada. That arrow point basal width is more variable in eastern California than central Nevada likely reflects differences in the cultural processes attending the spread and subsequent maintenance of bow-and-arrow technology in these two localities.

Metric data on 449 North American points, 31 Central American points, and 61 South American points were entered into a database. Ratios calculated from these metric attributes are used to quantify aspects of point shape across the two continents. The results of this analysis indicate gradual, progressive changes in fluted point outline shape from the Great Plains of western North America into adjacent parts of North America as well as into Central and South America. The South American ""Fishtail"" form of fluted point is seen as the culmination of incremental changes in point shape that began well into North America. A geographically gradual decline in fluting frequency also is consistent with the stylistic evolution of the stemmed ""Fishtail"" points. Although few in number, the available radiocarbon dates do suggest that ""Fishtail"" fluted points in southern South America are younger than the earliest dates associated with Clovis points in western North America. All of these data converge on the conclusion that South American ""Fishtail"" points evolved from North American fluted points.

There is widespread agreement that Clovis and related cultures of the Early Paleoindian period (∼11,500-10,500 BP) represent the first well-documented indications of human occupation, but considerable differences of opinion exist regarding the origins of these cultures. Here, we report the results of a study in which data from a continent-wide sample of Early Paleoindian projectile points were analyzed with cladistic methods in order to assess competing models of colonization as well as several alternative explanations for the variation among the points, including adaptation to local environmental circumstances, cultural diffusion, and site type effects. The analyses suggest that a rapidly migrating population produced the Early Paleoindian projectile point assemblages. They also suggest that the population in question is unlikely to have entered North America from either the Isthmus of Panama or the Midatlantic region. According to the analyses, the Early Paleoindians are more likely to have entered North America via either the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that is hypothesized to have opened around 12,000 BP, or the Northwest Coast. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Study of the mechanisms whereby cultural traits persist and change over time is key to understanding human cultural diversity. For more than a century, a central question has engaged anthropologists interested in the study of cultural trait variation: What is the source of cultural variation? More precisely, are cultural traits transmitted primarily from ancestral to descendant populations (vertical transmission) or between contemporary, typically neighboring populations (horizontal transmission), or do they emerge as independent innovations? While debates among unilineal evolutionists and diffusionists have long since faded, there is still much uncertainty about how traits are transmitted at this macroevolutionary level, as well as about the implications of these transmission patterns for testing hypotheses regarding the adaptive function of particular cultural traits across human populations.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646704525

The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture.

This paper demonstrates how to simulate the evolution of complex morphologies over geological timescales of millions of generations. The simulations are used to test how various assumptions about microevolutionary parameters and processes manifest themselves on macroevolutionary timescales. Complex morphology is modelled using geometric representations of shape (e.g., landmarks or outlines), and so the procedure described here is limited to single rigid structures. The procedure is based on empirically measured phenotypic correlations, which constrain the evolutionary outcomes in biologically realistic ways. Different microevolutionary assumptions about covariances, population size, and evolutionary mode can be tested by incorporating them into the simulation parameters. The evolution of molar tooth morphology in shrews is simulated under four different evolutionary modes: (1) randomly fluctuating selection; (2) directional selection; (3) stabilizing selection; and (4) genetic drift. Each of these modes leaves a distinctive imprint on the distribution of morphological distances, a feature that can be used to reconstruct the mode from real comparative data. A comparison of the results with real data on shrew molar diversity suggests that teeth have evolved predominantly by randomly fluctuating selection. The rate of divergence in shrew molars is greater than expected under drift, but it is neither linear nor static as expected with directional or stabilizing selection. The evolution of morphology with randomly fluctuating selection is also simulated on a phylogenetic tree. Daughter species share derived morphologies and positions within the principal components spaces in which the simulation is run. This result suggests that phylogeny can be successfully reconstructed from multivariate morphometric data when organisms have evolved under any mode except strong stabilizing selection.

As in the experiment, individual learning is found to generate low correlations between artifact attributes, whereas indirectly biased cultural transmission (copying the point design of the most successful hunter) generates high correlations between artifact attributes. These results support the hypothesis that low attribute correlations in prehistoric California resulted from individual learning, and high attribute correlations in prehistoric Nevada resulted from indirectly biased cultural transmission. However, alternative modes of cultural transmission, including conformist transmission and random copying, generated similarly high attribute correlations as indirect bias, suggesting that it may be difficult to infer which transmission rule generated this archaeological pattern. On the other hand, indirect bias outperformed all other cultural-transmission rules, lending plausibility to the original hypothesis. Importantly, this advantage depends on the assumption of a multimodal adaptive landscape in which there are multiple locally optimal artifact designs. Indeed, in unimodal fitness environments no cultural transmission rule outperformed individual learning, highlighting how the shape of the adaptive landscape within which cultural evolution occurs can strongly influence the dynamics of cultural transmission. Generally, experimental and computer simulations can be useful in answering questions that are difficult to address with archaeological data, such as identifying the consequences of different modes of cultural transmission or exploring the effect of different selective environments.

Here, we test this hypothesis quantitatively with matrix correlation statistics. Using a sample of Early Paleoindian point assemblages from across the continent we attempt to correlate variation in point shape with several measures of late Pleistocene period regional variation including net primary production, prey availability, prey selection, and prey body size. We find no significant correlations between point shape and measures of regional variation, suggesting that functional modifications to points within specific regional biomes were minimal. We do find evidence of spatial autocorrelation as the regional variation in point shape correlates positively with geographic distances among sites, a pattern consistent with recent, shared ancestry. Our findings provide support for the drift hypothesis posed by Morrow and Morrow (1999). We interpret these results as suggesting that despite the wide variation in regional environmental conditions across late Pleistocene period North America not enough time elapsed during the Early Paleoindian period for these local selective gradients to have led to significant changes in point shape.

One means of supplementing fossil evidence is to utilize archaeological evidence in the form of stone tools. Based on broad dating patterns, it has long been thought that the appearance of Acheulean handaxe technologies outside of Africa was the result of hominin dispersals, yet independent tests of this hypothesis remain rare. Cultural transmission theory leads to a prediction of a strong African versus non-African phylogeographic pattern in handaxe datasets, if the African Acheulean hypothesis is to be supported. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, this prediction is tested using an intercontinental dataset of Acheulean handaxes and a biological phylogenetic method (maximum parsimony). The analyses produce a tree consistent with the phylogeographic prediction. Moreover, a bootstrap analysis provides evidence that this pattern is robust, and the maximum parsimony tree is also shown to be statistically different from a tree constrained by stone raw materials. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate that nested analyses of behavioural data, utilizing methods drawn from biology, have the potential to shed light on ancient hominin dispersals. This is an encouraging prospect for human palaeobiology since sample sizes for lithic artefacts are many orders of magnitude higher than those of fossil data. These analyses also suggest that the sustained occurrence of Acheulean handaxe technologies in regions such as Europe and the Indian subcontinent resulted from dispersals by African hominin populations. © 2009 Stephen J.

Because cultural behaviours can be transmitted horizontally among socially defined groups, however, it is important to assess whether phylogeny-based methods - which were developed to study vertically transmitted traits among biological taxa - are appropriate for studying group-level cultural variation. Here, we describe a spatially explicit simulation model that can be used to generate data with known degrees of horizontal donation. We review previous results from this model showing that horizontal transmission increases the type I error rate of phylogenetically independent contrasts in studies of correlated evolution. These conclusions apply to cases in which two traits are transmitted as a pair, but horizontal transmission may be less problematic when traits are unlinked. We also use the simulation model to investigate whether measures of homology (the consistency index and the retention index) can detect horizontal transmission of cultural traits. Higher rates of evolutionary change have a stronger depressive impact on measures of homology than higher rates of horizontal transmission; thus, low consistency or retention indices are not necessarily indicative of 'ethnogenesis'. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the importance of using simulations to assess the validity of methods in cross-cultural research. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Consistency index; Correlated evolution; Cross-cultural comparison; Cultural traits; Phylogeny; Simulation study","anthropology; comparative study; correlation; evolutionary biology; phylogenetics; phylogeny",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650377786

By contrast, linear regression analyses often incorrectly concluded that traits were correlated. Where simulated trait evolution was not correlated and traits were horizontally transmitted as a pair, both methods inferred increased levels of positive correlation with increasing horizontal transmission. Where simulated trait evolution was correlated, increasing rates of separate horizontal transmission led to decreasing levels of inferred correlation for both methods, but increasing rates of paired horizontal transmission did not. Furthermore, the PCM was also able to make accurate inferences about the ancestral state of traits. These results suggest that under certain conditions, PCMs can be robust to the effects of horizontal transmission. We discuss ways that future work can investigate the mode and tempo of horizontal transmission of cultural traits. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Ancestral state; Cultural evolution; Cultural phylogenetics; Galton's problem; Horizontal transmission; Phylogenetic comparative methods","ancestry; comparative study; cultural heritage; cultural history; cultural tradition; hypothesis testing; phylogenetics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650318929

Scar patterning is often treated as a rough guide to identifying methods of core preparation and reduction and usually forms a key component of lithic typologies and other systems of analysis. However, scar patterns are often complex and difficult to capture using traditional measurement or classificatory techniques, particularly where flakes are thick and irregular, or where cores are flaked on many sides from a number of platforms. Three-dimensional analysis of flake scars is now more feasible using digital 3D surface scanning technologies, or using three-dimensional measurement tools such as the Microscribe-3DX which is now widely used in biological geometric morphometric studies more generally [D.C.

By their composition, we interpret assemblages as expressions of activity or cultural identity. Yet they are not simple products of these factors alone but also of formation processes. Assemblages accumulated over varying spans, with varying combinations of tool types and discard rates. They are contexts for the playing out of complex relationships, not static types. This is a materialist view, against the essentialist view that assemblages are exemplars of ideal types (e.g., ""base camps,"" ""Quina Mousterian ""). Materialism implies that their size and composition, fundamental assemblage characteristics, are correlated variables, not fixed properties, and that composition varies as size increases. I document size dependence consistent with materialism in PaleoIndian and Paleolithic assemblages. Among ways to analyze size-dependent assemblage data, I apply ""SHE analysis""-the joint study of assemblage richness, heterogeneity, and evenness-to gauge data's fit to theoretical models. Archaeologists acknowledge size dependence, but we misapprehend it as a methodological bias of assemblage measures that must be suppressed when, in materialist perspective, it reveals meaningful relationships that an essentialist view cannot.

The rugged fitness landscape featured in Sewall Wright's (1931; 1932) shifting balance theory provides a strong warrant for these arguments; forces other than natural selection are needed to move populations from lower to high fitness peaks. The analogy is particularly apt for humans because the bulk of human behavior is acquired by social transmission and has payoffs that hinge on the result of social interaction, producing many different adaptive equilibria. Groups that make their way to superior equilibria are selected for, resulting in group selection, the pace of which is hastened by cultural transmission. © 2009 Springer-Verlag New York.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883182675

Popular in archaeology in recent years, selectionism remains better known for programmatic statements than for empirical applications. Boyd and Richerson's transmission models only weakly account for variation and, presumably, selection through time in metric attributes of points in Late Woodland and Emergent Mississippian contexts at the Range site in midwestern North America. Social transmission should increase with population size and social complexity. Range's occupation spans several cycles in these properties without corresponding variation in metric values and their dispersion predicted by theory.
