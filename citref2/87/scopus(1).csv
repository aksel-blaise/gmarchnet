Procrustes distance may be used to compare different shapes and also serve as a metric that may be used to define multidimensional shape spaces. This paper demonstrates that the preshape space of planar triangles Procrustes aligned to a reference triangle corresponds to a unit hemisphere. An overview of methods used as linear approximations of D. G. Kendall's non-Euclidean shape space is given, and the equivalence of several methods based on orthogonal projections is shown. Some problems with approximations based on stereographic projections are also discussed.

Modules are integrated internally by many interactions among their component parts, but are linked to one another only by few or weak interactions. Accordingly, traits within modules are tightly correlated with each other, but relatively independent of traits in other modules. Hypotheses concerning the boundaries of modules in a landmark configuration can therefore be tested by comparing the strength of covariation among alternative partitions of the configuration into subsets of landmarks. If a subdivision coincides with the true boundaries between modules, the correlations among subsets should be minimal. This article introduces Escoufier's RV coefficient and the multi-set RV coefficient as measures of the correlation between two or more subsets of landmarks. These measures can be compared between alternative partitions of the configuration into subsets. Because developmental interactions are tissue bound, it is sensible to require that modules should be spatially contiguous. I propose a criterion for spatial contiguity for sets of landmarks using an adjacency graph.

An examination of temporal trends in the use of bifacial implements in the Carson Sink of western Nevada shows how the proposed perspective on lithic technology can help to elucidate change in mobility strategies. A shift from the use of bifaces as cores to an infrequent use of bifaces as tools suggests a shift from logistical to short-term residential use of the raw-material-poor Carson Sink; a later shift to the use of small, frequently unifacial, nonresharpenable points may indicate a shift to target-specific hunting strategies. © Society for American Archaeology 1988.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0010035110

The traditional model argues for an early use of the throwing spear followed by the spearthrower and bow and arrow. A major difficulty in testing this model is identifying the functional variables that characterize different weaponry. The evolution of prehistoric weaponry is reexamined here from an evolutionary perspective where projectile points are considered part of the complete weapon system and variation within that system is identified. The engineering of four weapon systems, the thrusting spear, throwing spear, spearthrower, and bow, are examined to identify those point variables that enhance the success of the system. These variables are then measured on a 9000-year sequence of projectile points from northwestern Wyoming to examine time/space patterns. The patterns reveal that the spearthrower was in use prior to 7500 years ago.","Engineering of primitive weaponry; Mummy Cave © 1998 plenum publishing corporation; Prehistoric weaponry; Projectile point; Weapon evolution",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-54649083999

Existing techniques fail to provide a generic measure of retouching for all chipped stone artefacts. A fast and reliable index is proposed which measures retouch in terms of the invasiveness of flake scars on the surfaces of complete stone artefacts. Unlike other measures, the index of invasiveness is well suited to the analysis of bifacially worked artefacts such as bifacial points and bifaces. Experimental tests demonstrate a strong correlation between the index and measures of reduction based on diminishing flake weight and numbers of retouch blows. Inter-observer reliability is also demonstrated through the use of a blind test. Limitations of the method are discussed, although potential techniques for surmounting problems are identified. An archaeological application of the index demonstrates the utility of the method in the context of regional assemblage variability in northern Australia.","Bifacial tool reduction; Curation; Experimental flintknapping; Northern Australia; Stone artefacts","archaeology; artifact",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036173375

With one possible exception, we did not obtain new results to confirm earlier observations of pre-Clovis-age cultural activity at any of the sites considered in this study. The possible exception, Arroyo Seco 2, is considered in detail elsewhere [Politis G., Gutierrez M.A., Scabuzzo, C. (Eds), in press.

In Palaeolithic archaeology's sister discipline of palaeoanthropology, detailed quantitative morphometric, geometric morphometric, and even 3D geometric morphometric analyses are now seen almost as routine. This period of relative methodological stasis may have been influenced by the lack of homologous landmarks on many lithic tools (essential for any comparative analysis), especially core-based technologies of the Lower Palaeolithic. Archaeological field conditions may also prohibit the use of expensive and delicate precision instruments in certain cases. Here we present a crossbeam co-ordinate caliper that - crucially - both geometrically locates and measures distances between morphologically homologous landmarks upon lithic nuclei via a single protocol. Intra- and inter-observer error tests provide evidence that error levels associated with the instrument fall within acceptable ranges. In addition, we present empirical examples of application in the form of a multivariate analysis of 55 discrete morphometric variables, and a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of co-ordinate landmark configurations derived from Pleistocene lithic nuclei (i.e. 'cores' sensu lato). We also introduce to lithic studies some techniques for the study of shape variation that have previously been used with success in biological morphometric analyses.

This three-dimensional technique is compared with conventional two-dimensional methods to investigate which methods capture morphological variation in the assemblage most comprehensively. Additionally, a set of experimentally produced bifacial tools are incorporated into the analyses to isolate the behavioral pattern underpinning identified variation in the archaeological assemblage. The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture. The intensity with which this strategy was applied seems to have been mediated by the availability of raw material that was suitable for the production of large bifacial tools. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the accuracy of these assessments has never been evaluated. Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes). Lastly, the absence of resharpening effects raises questions about the validity of the reduction thesis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A newly developed digitizing method is used to capture 12 interlandmark characters from coordinate data to describe point form. Principal components analysis is used to investigate size and shape variation in point form, and the symmetry and allometry of characters are used to explore the effects of resharpening on point dimensions. Size allometry illustrates the degree of association of relative point proportions, and other aspects of point form, with point size. Blade length, the leading edge of the weapon, was found to be isometric with point size, suggesting that this character was critical to the proper functioning of weapon tips. The regulation of blade length to point size supports a fixed-in-haft model for Folsom point resharpening. Multivariate analyses show that reduction in point forms do not correlate with distance-to-source but are more consistent with the model of the cyclical resharpening and replacement of points. This research illustrates that multivariate and allometric analyses are useful methods for investigating models of technological organization and the effects of resharpening on point form. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence of end scraper reduction is compared with faunal diversity and lithic material provenience, the former a potential catalyst of and the latter a potential reflection of mobility. A relationship between less-intense end scraper reduction, somewhat elevated percentages of distant raw materials, and reindeer-dominated fauna is noted during cold and apparently open environmental conditions. Less consistency in the extent of end scraper reduction is obsened among assemblages associated with more diverse and at times less-mobile fauna. These observations argue for the importance of a fine-grained comparison of lithic and other data, the complexity of procurement strategies, and the recognition that greater or lesser reduction does not translate directly into greater or lesser mobility. © 2003 by the Society for American Archaeology.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-20544464720

The available information, coming mostly from caves and rockshelters, is sufficient to initiate a discussion on the subsistence and technology of the early Patagonian hunter-gatherers. All the evidence points toward a generalized diet. Opportunistic use of Pleistocene mammals, together with a more systematic use of guanaco, is indicated. A redundant pattern of association of artifacts with ground sloth, horse, and guanaco is evident. Lithic artifacts were routinely and expediently made on rocks available in the immediate vicinity, with an emphasis on the transport of bifacial artifacts and/or preforms, adequate for situations of high mobility. Local raw material was used predominately. Human populations were living at low densities, and space, as well as other resources, was probably abundant in relation to human needs. Density-independent adaptations are thus indicated.

The symmetrical, bifluted form allowed a split, facial-contact haft to extend nearly to the tip, thereby controlling both location and extent of fracture and allowing many cycles of point reworking. Extreme thinnes achieved by fluting facilitated leading edge sharpness for enhanced penetration. The near-constant cross-section from tip to base meant no loss of leading edge acuteness upon resharpening and inter-changeability of broken segments. The high-friction, forwardly adjustable haft assured firm mounting even with shortened, reused point segments. This efficient design was critical for groups who spent weeks and maybe months away from raw material sources in pursuit of game. Short, exhausted Folsom points or 'slugs' are what archaeologists most commonly find and study. In contrast, a quite long, fully fluted point made from a yet longer preform was the intended product of the Folsom knapper. The model presented here can be tested through study of preform length, finished point proportions, fracture patterns, haft element features, and use-wear analysis in archaeological specimens, as well as actualistic hunting experiments. The engine driving persistent use of snap blade, full fluted projectile technology was focused commitment to a single, highly mobile game species (bison). This specific technofunctional element in Folsom culture reveals a weapon system designed to mitigate against extreme risk regarding access to raw material. Continuing research should demonstrate that the appearance, geographic distribution, persistence, and disappearance of the Folsom fluted point relate closely to juxtapositions of climatic change, biotic change, and human population movements that occurred near the end of the Pleistocene.

Twenty-six landmarks were digitized in three dimensions from the crania of 228 adult macaques from Cayo Santiago. The phenotypic variance between individuals was measured and divided into its genetic and environmental components using matriline information. Within-individual variance was measured as the fluctuating asymmetry between bilateral landmarks. We found positive and significant correlations between the phenotypic, environmental, and fluctuating asymmetry variances for interlandmark distances. We also found low but significant correspondences between the covariation structures of the three variability components using both Procrustes and interlandmark distance data. Therefore, we find that in macaque skulls traits that exhibit greater levels of asymmetry deviations also exhibit greater levels of environmental variance, and that the covariances of absolute symmetry deviations partly correspond to covariances of mean deviations at the individual level. These results suggest that the underlying processes that determine canalization and developmental stability are at least partly overlapping. However, the low correlations reported here are also evidence for a degree of independence between these variability components. © 2005 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

They are bifacial tools, including fishtail projectile points, bipolar products, and flakes. They have been found in both excavated assemblages dated between 10,000 and 11,000 BP, and in surface sites. Surface collections from Uruguay also include fishtail projectile points manufactured on this rock. Petrographic analyses were carried out to determine stone provenance. Archacological artifacts from the Argentine Pampas, and macroscopically similar nodules obtained from secondary deposits in Uruguay were analyzed. The rock used for the artifacts is composed of a siliceous very fine homogeneous mass that is nearly isotropic, and is characterized by recognizable remains of organisms, including silicified gastropods. The samples obtained from deposits in central and southern Uruguay have similar microscopic characteristics. Many of these deposits were exploited as indigenous quarries. Therefore, this reddish rock was transported from Uruguay to the Argentine Pampas by societies who inhabited the region during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Within this context, we discuss the social meaning of this long distance tool stone transport and propose that it was a result of human interaction networks. ©2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

This truism means that tools were reduced from larger pieces in the production process. But many tools were further reduced in use, to repair damage or as edges dulled. Reduction reduced size (trivially), but also changed the proportions among tools' elements or dimensions. Such allometric variation (change in proportion as a function of change in size) is useful to estimate the degree of reduction that tools experienced. Reduction itself is a measure of curation, a theoretical concept of great interest in lithic studies and Paleolithic archaeology. To determine the reduction that archaeological tools experienced, we must compare their size and proportions at first use to the same properties at discard that we directly measure.

Despite the importance of the concept of symmetry to studies of early human development, its current use is usually based on loose qualitative assessment. A more informative approach would be to use a continuous scale of this shape property rather than the strict current language of ""more"" or ""less"". A symmetry measurement tool has been developed, which is based on evaluation of the minimal distances that the vertices of a structure have to move in order to attain the required symmetry. Using this Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) method, it is possible to evaluate quantitatively how much symmetry exists in a non-symmetrical configuration and how the nearest symmetrical shape looks. We test and demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of this approach on handaxe samples from three Lower Paleolithic sites in Israel, Ubeidiya, Gesher Benot Ya'aqov and Ma'ayan Barukh, representing various stages in the Acheulian Techno-complex of the Levant. We provide, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, quantitative demonstration that the overall symmetry of handaxes generally increases, and that the variability decreases over time. © 1998 Academic Press.","Acheulian; Handaxes; Lower Paleolithic; Symmetry",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002206879

Here, we test this hypothesis quantitatively with matrix correlation statistics. Using a sample of Early Paleoindian point assemblages from across the continent we attempt to correlate variation in point shape with several measures of late Pleistocene period regional variation including net primary production, prey availability, prey selection, and prey body size. We find no significant correlations between point shape and measures of regional variation, suggesting that functional modifications to points within specific regional biomes were minimal. We do find evidence of spatial autocorrelation as the regional variation in point shape correlates positively with geographic distances among sites, a pattern consistent with recent, shared ancestry. Our findings provide support for the drift hypothesis posed by Morrow and Morrow (1999). We interpret these results as suggesting that despite the wide variation in regional environmental conditions across late Pleistocene period North America not enough time elapsed during the Early Paleoindian period for these local selective gradients to have led to significant changes in point shape. Recientemente se ha sugerido que las variaciones encontradas en las puntas de proyectiles a lo largo de Norteamerica durante la etapa temprana del periodo Paleoindio file el resultado de deriva, en lugar de la adaptacion regional (Morrow y Morrow 1999).

Encontramos evidencia de autocorrelacion espacial, ya que la variacion regional en la forma de las puntas se relaciona positivamente con la distancia geogrdfica entre sitios.

Clovis points actually are more common in the Eastern Woodlands, where they have been dated somewhat earlier at several sites. However, only one Clovis megamammal kill site has been found in the Eastern Woodlands, and none west of southeastern Arizona. Clovis points are relatively rarely found in Central America as far as Panama. A few Clovis-like points have been reported from Colombia and Chile, but stemmed ""fishtail"" points are more common in South America. Several sites in the southern cone of South America have yielded fishtail points dated as early as 11,000 14C yr BP. Some North American archaeologists hypothesize that fishtail points, a few of which appear to be fluted, are the work of Clovis migrants. However, such a hypothesis requires that a viable breeding population traversed about 12,000 km across deserts, mountains, and through jungles within a few hundred years. A simpler alternative hypothesis is that sometime in the Late Pleistocene, the first Americans brought a simple retouched flake industry with them from East Asia. Experimental knappers in various parts of the Americans eventually innovated bifacial points of different styles from these retouched flakes. It is time that this alternative model, which is more than 25 years old, be more seriously considered because it would better explain available evidence in South America as well as North America. © 2002 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

To arrive at the function of Pre-Pottery Neolithic A el-Khiam points from the Near East, controlled experiments were performed to determine the relative density of the contact material, which could affect use and retouch patterns. It was shown that el-Khiam points were likely used to pierce and scrape soft materials such as leather. The EKCI was then devised, measured, and tested. Experimental replication showed that the EKCI was an accurate measure of retouch intensity, and application of the EKCI to the lithic assemblage at Dhra' reaffirmed the EKCI's utility for analyzing PPNA archaeological assemblages. Although this curation index is effective for el-Khiam points, it may not be applicable to other hafted point types, which highlights the need for independently developed measures of retouch that account for the form, function, and context of the artifacts rather than attempting to generate universal measures of curation. Introduction Archaeological assemblages from the first farming villages in the Southern Levant have produced high-quality and large-quantity lithic data sets that Near Eastern archaeologists rely upon for interpreting the past.

Those successions correspond to the Puerto Yeruá Formation and their facies and aspects related to calcrete types have been analyzed in previous works (e.g. Tofalo, 1986 a, b). However, the micromorphological and diagenetical characterization of calcretes remains unresolved. This paper attempts to determine the diagenetic processes related to their genesis, taking into account micro features such as fabrics and textures. The data set of this study consists of 30 samples comprising all calcrete types (nodular, massive, laminar and brecciated) distinguished from macroscopic observations in the field. Some micro-features are present in all of calcrete types, such as alpha fabric (Fig. 2a,b) and crystallaria (including circumgranular types) but others are typical of each type of calcrete. The alpha fabric is a dense and continuous mass of relict micrite, mainly recrystallised to microspar and spar, with floating etched skeletal grains of quartz, sandstone, volcanic ground-mass and paleosol fragments. It was generated by the replacive and displasive growth of micrite in the vadose zone from supersaturated carbonate solutions during periods of rapid evaporation. In a few cases, the host material is cemented by sparry calcite with well-developed cleavages and straight intercrystalline boundaries, suggesting precipitation in the phreatic zone (Fig. 2c). Nodular calcretes are characterized by alpha fabric containing isolated glaebules (orthic and disorthic) with variable size and shape (Fig. 2d). Nodules are a product of diffusion followed by precipitation and displasive growth of carbonate. A well-developed alpha fabric with minor clotted texture generated by the concentration of cryptocrystalline calcite and clay in a micritic matrix is diagnostic of the massive calcretes. Laminar calcretes (Fig. 2e) consist of three different kinds of alternating sheet layers (a) micrite-spar, (b) carbonatesiliciclastic grains and (c) calcite-silica. This type of calcretes have been originated by precipitation of solutes in the vadose zone but above an impermeable surface. Brecciated calcretes present both complex cracks and crystallaria disrupting irregular calcrete intraclasts, fragments of the host material and sand-sized grains. Microstructures of brecciation reveal alternating episodes of fracturing, fragmentation and cementation related to the concatenation of several processes such as expansive growth, desiccation, solution and cementation-fracturing by pedoturbation of plant roots. The breakage and separation of sand grains is a common feature observed in most of the samples. The fracturing may be generated by displacive growth of calcite in the vadose zone while rotation and dispersion occurred within the phreatic zone during arid to semi arid climatic conditions. Silica complex vugh-fills are also present in most of the samples (Fig. 2f). They exhibit an inward zonation of different varieties of silica: lussatite, length-slow chalcedony (quartzine), length-fast chalcedony (chalcedonite) and megaquartz. Those vugh-fills have been originated by precipitation from mobile silicatic solutions in the phreatic zone. Our analysis suggests that the macroscopic classification of calcretes may be microscopically supported by variations in fabric and textures. Microscopical features suggest that all type of calcretes are the result of diagenetic processes developed in the vadose and phreatic zones. The domain of alpha fabric points out that origin of calcretes is related principally to moviments of the phreatic level. © 2002 Asociacion Argentina de Sedimentologia.

This method was applied here to evaluate the discrimination power of the inner lateral rib for two palstave populations dating from the Middle Bronze Age, excavated in northwest France. A corpus of almost 400 palstaves (bronze axes) of the Breton and Norman types was processed, and compared to specimens found at Sermizelles in Burgundy. The procedure is robust and produces a discrimination in good agreement with the traditional typology. Besides the definition of a 'standard' shape for each population, the morphometrical approach allows shape disparity, which is generally inaccessible to the naked eye, to be visualised and quantified. Shape disparity indicates that, contrary to previous assumptions, the bronze axes from the Sermizelles hoards cannot be explained as an assortment of Breton and Norman palstaves alone. We believe that this approach is quick, reproducible, and generalisable enough to be applied to a wide variety of artefacts from different periods, in order to clarify their typology and even their origin. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The statement bordered on a truism but was worth making in any event. Flakes, the small pieces of stone struck from larger objective pieces, were the subject then; the context was their abundance and diversity as generated in the production, use, and resharpening of tools. Flake analysis makes no sense without understanding the places that flakes occupy in the reduction process. But the reductive quality of stone also informs the analysis of objective pieces themselves, not least finished tools. Accordingly, tools also are a legitimate subject of reduction studies. A deceptively profound truism worth stating once is worth rephrasing: a glance at a chipped stone tool is enough to see that it was reduced from a larger piece. But the restatement itself requires elaboration. Trivially, tools were reduced from larger objective pieces in the process of production. No one has doubted this since archaeologists demonstrated human agency in the production of stone tools. Yet many tools were further retouched by resharpening, and so continued to experience reduction during use. This is the “reduction thesis” (Shott 2005), which archaeologists did not always appreciate in the past. This book is a milestone in the development of reduction analysis. Originating in pioneering studies such as Hoffman's (1985), until recently reduction analysis was conducted in isolation by few archaeologists. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889843675

Unlike other areas of North America, where dart technology is replaced by arrow technology, Coalition Period occupations on the Pajarito Plateau of New Mexico contain both hafted biface forms used simultaneously. A stylistic analysis of dart points shows that hafted biface forms found in Coalition Period contexts were recycled from Middle and Late Archaic surface scatters. Furthermore, retouch location and intensity show that Coalition Period dart points were used for cutting and sawing activities and not as projectile technology. Introduction In the American Southwest, and throughout North America, dart-sized hafted bifaces identified as projectile points, normally associated with sites dating to the Paleoindian and Archaic time periods, are regularly found on sites dating to the past thousand years (cf. Kohler 2004; Turnbow 1997). Late period points were likely small and designed to be attached to the smaller arrow foreshaft. Although researchers have noted the presence of dart-sized points in settings where the bow and arrow were likely used, few have addressed the question of the context of manufacture or use of these larger hafted bifaces. In the Northern Rio Grande, the presence of Scottsbluff, Jay, Bajada, and other large dart points dating to the Late Paleoindian and Archaic in Coalition and Classic period sites rarely elicits more than a description as a “curated” item or “heirloom,” or as a knife replicating an older style. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84455205762
