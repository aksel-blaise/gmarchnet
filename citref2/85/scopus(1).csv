Advantages of the procedure are that it does not require integration or the use of fast Fourier transform techniques, and that bounds on the accuracy of the image contour reconstruction are easy to specify. Elliptic properties of the Fourier coefficients are shown and used for a convenient and intuitively pleasing procedure of normalizing a Fourier contour representation. Extension of the contour representation to arbitrary objects at arbitrary aspect angle is discussed. The procedures have direct application to a variety of pattern recognition problems that involve analysis of well-defined image contours. © 1982.",,"accuracy; closed contour; Fourier coefficients; image; pattern recognition; PATTERN RECOGNITION SYSTEMS",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019999399

The method is conceptually more parsimonious than more traditional biometric methods based on discrete linear and angular measurements. Most importantly, however, shape analysis captures a much higher proportion of the morphological information resident in any fossil than analyses based on discrete measurements. The number of harmonics required in an elliptic Fourier analysis can be estimated from a series of inverse Fourier reconstructions, or from the power spectrum. In most studies it is appropriate to normalize Fourier coefficients for size, although this information can be reincorporated at a later stage. The coefficients should probably not be standardized, unless there is evidence to suggest that high‐frequency information was genetically as important as low‐frequency information. Depending upon the aims of a particular study and the morphological disparity of the fossils in question, it might be appropriate to eliminate the first harmonic (‘best‐fitting’) ellipse from an analysis. Meaningful comparison of the left and right valves of bivalves requires the digitized coordinates of one or other to be mirrored prior to computation of the Fourier coefficients. □Biometric analysis, Bivalvia, elliptic Fourier analysis, morphometrics.

The results have been synthesized through a diachronic map, whose chronological phases are related to socio-economic and cultural human evolution. The house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) progression in the Mediterranean begins with a quick but limited diffusion in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin achieved around the 8th millennium BC. Until the 1st millennium BC, the invasive process seems to have stopped or drastically slowed, despite the increasing opportunities of passive transport during the Bronze Age. During the 1st millennium BC, there was mass colonization by the house mouse of the entire Western Mediterranean Basin and Northern Europe. We propose to explain this chronological gap in the colonization of the Eastern and Western Mediterranean using source-sink theory considering that the western environments acted like sinks until the first millennium BC. At that time the Western Mediterranean was fully opened to Eastern influences and migrations, and the human pressures on the environment drastically increased. This may have favoured definitively the adaptation of the house mouse to the Western commensal niches. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London.","Anthropization; Coevolution; Invasive species; Phylogeography; Source-sink; Subfossils","Bronze Age; coevolution; new record; phylogeography; source-sink dynamics; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; oceanic regions; World; Mus musculus",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-15944428237

Génome et Populations, CNRS URA 1493, Université Montpellier II, F-34095 Montpellier, France","On the basis of patterns of allele frequency variation in nuclear genes (Din et al., in press) it has been proposed that the house mouse M. musculus originated in the northern Indian subcontinent, from where it radiated in several directions to form the well-described peripheral subspecies (M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus). Here we use a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny to test this hypothesis and to analyse the historical and demographic events that have accompanied this differentiation. This marker also provides a powerful means to check for genetic continuity between the central and peripheral populations. We studied restriction site polymorphism of samples from India and the Middle East as well as samples from the rest of Erusia and northern Africa. M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus are both monophyletic for mtDNA and belong to the subspecies- specific mtDNA lineages that have been described previously. Average nucleotide diversity is low in M. m. musculus (0.2-5%). It is not only higher in M. m. domesticus (0.7-0.9%) but the distribution of pairwise divergence is wider, and the rate of evolution in this branch appears to be higher than in M. m. musculus. The nucleotide diversity found in M. m. castaneus (0.4%) is due to the existence of two rather divergent linages with little intralineage variation. These two lineages are part of a diversified bush of the phylogenetic tree that also comprises several previously undescribed branches and includes all samples from the northern Indian subcontinent and Iran. The degree of diversity found in each of the samples from this region is high (1.2-2.4%) although they come from small geographic areas. This agrees well with the idea that the origin of the radiation was in the northern Indian subcontinent. However, as neither haplotypes on the M. m. domesticus nor on the M. m. musculus branches were found in this region, there appear to be important phylogeographic discontinuities between this central region and these peripherial subspecies. On the basis of the present results and the nuclear data (Din el al., in press), we propose that M. musculus originated in the north of the Indian subcontinent. Our calibration of the evolutionary rate of mtDNA in mice suggests that the mouse settlement in this region could be as old as 900 000 years. Possibly from there, a first radiation could have reached the Middle East and the Caspian Sea, where the M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus lineages, respectively, would have started to differentiate a few hundred thousand years ago, and from where they could have colonised the peripheral part of their ranges only recently. M. m. castaneus appears from its mtDNA to be a recent offshoot of the northern Indian population. This multiple and gradual radiation ultimately led to recent peripheral secondary contacts, such as the well-known European hybrid zone.","mitochondrial DNA; Mus musculus; phylogeography; radiation","Mus musculus; Musculus; Mus musculus castaneus; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus musculus musculus; house mouse; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeny; radiation; Africa, (North); Asia; India, (North); Middle East",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029659472

Examined on a regional or local level, architecture of the Neolithic is often presented as a fairly homogenous social practice over the large area of Southeast Europe. In viewing the Neolithic houses as homogenous and uncontroversial material culture, archaeologists have overlooked not only the possible variation and multimeaning of the Neolithic houses but also their striking and extensive means of destruction. The role of house conflagration, a practice that lasted during the entire Neolithic of Southeast Europe, has not been addressed in archaeological investigations. Indeed the phenomenon of burned houses has been treated as a series of lucky accidents during the Neolithic, which are primarily responsible for the preservation of Neolithic sites. Contrary this view, I argue that it is unlikely that the houses were burned as a result of a series of accidents or for any structural and technological reasons but rather that they were destroyed by deliberate burning and most likely for reasons of a symbolic nature. The causes for the practice of house firing and house abandonment as observed through the architectural evidence at the site of Opovo are believed to have been related to the need for house replacement and securing its postutilitarian visibility in order to show social and material continuity of the Neolithic society. In my view, a struggle for social and material continuity might have been a leading mobilizing force in creating and maintaining social practices and beliefs in the Neolithic society. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001324090

After successive immigration waves of the genus Mus into this zone from the late Pliocene to the upper Pleistocene, the house mouse appeared and remained confined to the easternmost Mediterranean Basin at the uppermost Pleistocene. The first progression of this species into the Mediterranean Basin occurred in the Middle East from the Epipaleolithic to the Neolithic. Subsequently, this species was found in the western Mediterranean Basin during the Bronze Age and in north‐west Europe during the Iron Age. In comparison to this latter zone, north central Europe was colonized relatively early, from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age which may, in fact, not only correspond to a much earlier invasion of Europe by M. musculus musculus but also suggest that the distribution of this subspecies extended much further west than it does nowadays, at a time when M. musculus domesticus was restricted to the Mediterranean zone. This archaeological survey is in agreement with genetic data which provide indications as to the speed, steps and pathways of progression of house mouse populations in western Eurasia.

This methodological paper examines approaches to optimizing the classification of specimens based on their outlines. This study examines the performance of four approaches to the mathematical representation of outlines and two different approaches to curve measurement as applied to a collection of feather outlines. A new approach to the dimension reduction necessary to carry out a CVA on this type of outline data with modest sample sizes is also presented, and its performance is compared to two other approaches to dimension reduction. Results: Two semi-landmark-based methods, bending energy alignment and perpendicular projection, are shown to produce roughly equal rates of classification, as do elliptical Fourier methods and the extended eigenshape method of outline measurement. Rates of classification were not highly dependent on the number of points used to represent a curve or the manner in which those points were acquired. The new approach to dimensionality reduction, which utilizes a variable number of principal component (PC) axes, produced higher cross-validation assignment rates than either the standard approach of using a fixed number of PC axes or a partial least squares method. Conclusion: Classification of specimens based on feather shape was not highly dependent of the details of the method used to capture shape information. The choice of dimensionality reduction approach was more of a factor, and the cross validation rate of assignment may be optimized using the variable number of PC axes method presented herein. © 2006 Sheets et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749530871

We address this by studying a sample from the southeastern tip of the Fertile Crescent in the Iranian province of Ahvaz. Including other published and unpublished data from France, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Turkey and other places in Iran, altogether 321 mitochondrial D-loop sequences are simultaneously analysed. The patterns of coalescence obtained corroborate the classical proposal according to which the Fertile Crescent is where commensalism with humans has started in the Western Hemisphere, and from where the subspecies has expanded further west. Our data also clearly show that despite multiple colonisations and long-range transportation, there is still a rather high ΦST of 0.39. The original expansion signal is still recognisable, with two well-separated derived clades, allowing us to propose a hypothetical scenario in which expansion toward Europe and Asia Minor took at least two routes, tentatively termed the Mediterranean and the Bosphorus/Black Sea routes. This scenario resembles that of another domesticated species, the goat, and fits with the known progression of Neolithic culture. Given the concomitance of both phenomena around 12 000 years ago, we propose a recalibration of the D-loop mutation rate to a much faster tick of ∼40% per site per million years (Myr). This value should be used for intrasubspecific polymorphism, while the interspecific rate in Mus is presently estimated at 6-10%/site/Myr. This is in keeping with the now well recognised fact that only a subfraction of segregating mutations go to fixation. © 2007 The Authors.","D-loop; Fertile Crescent; Mitochondrial DNA coalescence; Mus musculus domesticus; Postglacial colonization","mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; chemistry; classification; Europe; genetic variability; genetics; geography; Iran; molecular genetics; mouse; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; population genetics; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Europe; Genetics, Population; Geography; Iran; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Variation (Genetics); Capra hircus; Ixodida; Mus musculus; Mus musculus domesticus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149012877

When reducing the complexity of the matrilineal network to a series of haplogroups (HGs), our main results indicate that: (i) several HGs are recognized which seem to have almost simultaneously diverged from each other, confirming a recent expansion for the whole subspecies; (ii) some HGs are geographically delimited while others are widespread, indicative of multiple introductions or secondary exchanges; (iii) mice from the western and the eastern coasts of Africa harbour largely different sets of HGs; and (iv) HGs from the two shores of the Mediterranean are more similar in the west than in the east. This pattern is in keeping with the two-step westward expansion proposed by zooarchaeological data, an early one coincident with the Neolithic progression and limited to the eastern Mediterranean and a later one, particularly evident in the western Mediterranean, related to the generalization of maritime trade during the first millennium BC and onwards. The dispersal of mice along with humans, which continues until today, has for instance left complex footprints on the long ago colonized Cyprus or more simple ones on the much more recently populated Canary Islands. © 2010 The Royal Society.","House mouse; Matrilineal phylogeography; Mitochondrial D-loop; Neolithic expansion; Zooarchaeology","coastal zone; colonization; data processing; dispersal; genetic variation; Mediterranean environment; Neolithic; rodent; species diversity; Africa; Mediterranean Sea; mitochondrial DNA; Africa; animal; article; classification; DNA sequence; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genetics; haplotype; mitochondrion; molecular genetics; mouse; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; sequence alignment; Southern Europe; Africa; Animals; Base Sequence; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genetic Variation; Haplotypes; Mediterranean Region; Mice; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Genetic; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958249603

Recently, a phylogenetic survey has shown that the non-commensal mouse of Cyprus was an unknown sister species of European wild mice. Here, we describe this new species of the genus Mus (Rodentia, Mammalia), namely Mus cypriacus sp. n., based on 19 specimens trapped in the southern part of Cyprus. These animals were first compared to Eurasian species of mice using both molecular genet-ics (complete D-loop sequences and nuclear gene intron) and cytogenetics to state on its systematic status. Then classical and geometric morphometric analyses on both cranial and dental characters have been performed to compare Mus cypriacus with circum-Mediterranean species and provide diagnositic morphological characters. Genetic data strongly support a sister species relationship of the new species to M. macedonicus, the closest mainland taxon. Morphometric analyses provide satisfying criteria for diagnosis of this species relative to other Mediterranean species. The most obvious phenotypic characteristics are its long tail and the allometric gigantism and shape robustness of its cranial and dental characters compared to other Mediterranean mice. The molecular clock and the history of the murine settlement on Cyprus are congruent and suggest that the common ancestor of M. cypriacus and M. macedonicus arrived on Cyprus during the Middle Pleistocene by a founder event on natural raft. The remoteness of Cyprus through time has prevented introgression from the mainland gene pool, and favoured phenotypic adaptation to competition release, leading to the allopatric speciation of M. cypriacus.

The size and shape geographical differentiation is studied in order to discuss the possible evolutionary patterns and constraints leading to this distribution. Location. Two species of Oenomys have been previously recognized, corresponding to the West African forest block on the one hand and to the main forest block on the other hand. Both species have been sampled, and forty localities permit the study of the whole geographical range of Oenomys, from Guinea to Kenya. Methods. A Fourier analysis applied to the outlines of the first upper and lower molars allows a quantification of the size and shape variations across the geographical range of Oenomys. Results. This morphometrical analysis defines three morphological groups of Oenomys, corresponding to the West, Central, and East African forest zone. This result suggests the existence of an additional cryptic species. The Western group is characterized by broad asymmetrical molars and a small size. The Central African group has more elongated and larger molars while the Eastern African group displays extremely constricted molars and a small size. Main conclusion. The shape can be considered as characteristic of each group and its variations appear to be mostly related to phylogeny while size exhibits variations within each group related to climatic gradients. This discrepancy could be related to different genetic determinants for both characters, the shape being strongly genetically constrained while size can vary according to a wide range of environmental factors.","Evolution; Fourier analysis; Geographical variation; Morphology; Muridae","africa; Central Africa; climate; environment; forest; Fourier analysis; geographic distribution; Kenya; morphometrics; phylogeny; size; species difference; West Africa; body shape; body size; climate effect; morphology; rodent; zoogeography; Africa; Invertebrata; Muridae; Murinae; Oenomys; Rodentia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033427280

Some factors such as sex and age of the animals could be a source of within-group morphological variability interfering with among-groups patterns of differentiation. The relative importance of both sources of shape variation was investigated, in order to evaluate the robustness of patterns of fine-scale geographic differentiation. The increasing age of the animals, estimated by wear stages of the upper tooth row, caused significant variations in size and shape of the molars due to progressive abrasion of the cusps. It also involved shape changes of the mandible due to bone remodelling. However, these intrapopulational effects are of limited importance compared to geographic differentiation. Gene flow among populations should be favoured across mainland populations but lowered between mainland and islands, and to a lesser extent among close islands. Shape differences in molars are in agreement with this expected pattern of gene flow. Patterns of mandible differentiation rather match local variations in habitats. At this fine geographic scale, molar shape would vary according to the amount of genetic exchange among populations whereas mandible shape might be under local selective and/or functional constraints. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

In order to achieve this, the mouse species present on the archipelago were first compared with a set of continental mice. The differences between the continental and Canary Island samples, and among the Canary Island samples, provide insights into the processes of colonization and the subsequent insular evolution. Location: Canary archipelago. Methods: An outline analysis based on Fourier transformation was used to quantify shape differences between lower molars. Together with the fossil and modern Canary Island samples, a reference set of genotyped continental populations of the commensal Mus musculus and the wild Mus spretus was used for comparison. Results: The morphometric analysis showed that all the mouse specimens from the Canary Islands and Cape Verde belonged to Mus musculus domesticus. Lower molars of extant mice from La Gomera, El Hierro, Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and to a lesser degree from Lanzarote, were similar to those of genotyped M. m. domesticus from the continent, while teeth of extant mice from Fuerteventura were more divergent. Fossil mice from Fuerteventura were very similar to the extant representatives on this island, and similar to the fossil mice on the nearby islands of Lobos and La Graciosa. Main conclusions: The mouse present on the Canary archipelago has been identified as the house mouse M. m. domesticus. Based on the shape of the lower molar, the Canary Island mice are divergent from the continental ones, but the degree of divergence varies with the geography of the archipelago. Overall, populations from eastern islands are more divergent from the continental mice than populations from western ones. Fossil populations indicate that this situation was established several centuries ago. Two main factors may have contributed to this pattern: the appearance of different types of environment on the islands since the successful settlement of the mouse, and/or the number of subsequent introductions of continental individuals via shipping. © 2007 The Authors.","Anthropization; Colonization; Fourier transform; Geometric morphometry; Human migration; Insular syndrome; Island biogeography; Late Holocene; Mus musculus domesticus; Zooarchaeology","archipelago; colonization; commensal; dentition; divergence; evolution; fossil record; Fourier transform; Holocene; invasive species; island biogeography; morphometry; rodent; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Canary Islands; Cape Verde; Eurasia; Europe; Gomera; Gran Canaria; Hierro; Las Palmas; Macaronesia; Santa Cruz de Tenerife [(PRV) Canary Islands]; Southern Europe; Spain; Tenerife; Mus; Mus musculus; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus spretus; Nesomys rufus; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447628023

The anecdotal find of the small murine (mice and rats) mandible among the wealthy cargo of the Uluburun shipwreck provide us with an unexpected opportunity to directly evidence the species associated with this stowaway and provide indirect clues regarding the ship's route. Taxonomic identification and geographic sourcing has been performed using outline molar shape analysis by Elliptic Fourier Transform comparing the Uluburun mouse molar phenotype with extant populations from eastern Mediterranean sibling species. Results showed that the mandible belonged to the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) with significant phenotypic similarities with extant Syrian house mouse populations. These results provide the earliest direct evidence for stowaway transports highlighting the historical process of the house mouse invasion of the Mediterranean. Using modern behavioural comparisons, combined with archaeological and historical sources, it has been argued that the servicing port of Ugarit (Minet el Beida) was a likely step on the vessel's last journey. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Shape was shown to be significantly correlated both with longitude and latitude in M. macedonicus, yet the correlation between morphometric and geographic distances was not significant, and morphometric differences between Asian and European populations were not higher than those within the particular continents. The phylogenetic signal was found to be stronger in dental characters than in cranial ones, however, overall concordance between the pattern of morphometric variation and the presumed history of M. macedonicus was rather weak. In both species, the dorsal and ventral sides of the skull were shown to covary in many aspects though there were also some differences between them, making the functional interpretation of these differences difficult.

These data were for the first time ever combined into a single database by unification of nomenclature of 21 loci examined by different authors in 39 populations. Analysis of geographical allele distribution have shown that populations of domestic Transcaucasian mice are close to Indo-Pakistani populations of form oriental of the species M. castaneus, which preserved a high level of ancestral polymorphism. We concluded that a very heterogeneous, rich gene pool of house mice from Transcaucasia could not develop only by secondary contacts of differentiated M. musculus s. str. and M. domesticus forms, since it is similar to the ancestral gene pool of the superspecies complexes M. musculus and M. spicilegus. In this context, unique characteristics of some Central Asian populations were examined; these populations may have served as a ""transit station"" in the dispersal of commensal house mice forms. We suggest that the Transcaucasian populations are genealogically closely related to an early Near East form of M. musculus, which, as M. domesticus and M. castaneus, split from the common ancestor and preserved nondifferentiated pool of ancestral alleles of protein genes. This hypothesis admits the involvement of differentiated species M. musculus s. str. and M. domesticus in the ultimate formation of the gene pool of Transcaucasian house mice. Apparently, these populations resulted from alternation and (or) ""overlapping"" of different evolutionary processes. A scenario suggesting that hybrid events having occurred in Transcaucasia at different times, were ""superposed"" on the gene pool of the ancient autochtonous population of house mice from this region seems most plausible. Analysis of allozyme variability in the modern Transcaucasian Mus populations could not always distinguish between ancestral polymorphism and hybridization consequences.",,"allele; article; controlled study; Cuba; data base; Eastern Europe; genealogy; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; geography; hybridization; medical literature; Middle East; molecular evolution; mouse; mutation; nonhuman; species differentiation; Western Europe; Mus; Mus musculus; Mus spicilegus; Musculus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-4544376819
