The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition. © 1995, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This was done so that people used to R would not have to learn yet another interface, and also because we believe the formula interface is a good way of working interactively with models. It thus has methods for generic functions like predict, update and coef. It also has more specialised functions like scores, loadings and RMSEP, and a flexible cross-validation system. Visual inspection and assessment is important in chemometrics, and the pis package has a number of plot functions for plotting scores, loadings, predictions, coefficients and RMSEP estimates. The package implements PCR and several algorithms for PLSR. The design is modular, so that it should be easy to use the underlying algorithms in other functions. It is our hope that the package will serve well both for interactive data analysis and as a building block for other functions or packages using PLSR or PCR.

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

The hypotheses advanced by Bunn (1986; Bunn and Kroll, 1986) and Leakey (1971), and by Binford (1981, 1986) are tested using the proportion of long bone specimens bearing hammerstone percussion marks and carnivore tooth marks. Unambiguous test implications based on surface mark frequencies are provided by results of well controlled experiments and naturalistic observations that model three alternative sequences of long bone processing and consumption by hominids and/or carnivores. Percussion mark and tooth mark frequencies, reported systematically for the first time on the assemblage from FLK Zinjanthropus, allow the rejection of the hypothesis that carnivores rather than hominids at FLK Zinjanthropus enjoyed first access to marrow in long bone cavities. This result contradicts Binford's characterization of Plio-Pleistocene hominids as marginal scavengers of carcasses heavily ravaged by bone-crunching carnivores. However, a high proportion of tooth-marked long bone midshaft fragments allows the rejection of the alternative hypothesis that carnivore access to long bones was exclusively or even primarily secondary to butchery and marrow extraction by hominids, as argued by Bunn (1986; Bunn and Kroll, 1986) and Leakey (1971). The results show that the sequence of carnivore and hominid access to long bones, and their respective carcass tissue yields, was more complex, as is consistent with a dominantly passive scavenging mode of carcass acquisition by hominids hypothesized earlier on the basis of skeletal part data and paleoecological considerations. Confidence in these deductions based on surface mark frequencies is increased by demonstrations of (i) a close comparability in agencies of bone fragmentation between the control samples and FLK Zinjanthropus; (ii) the representativeness of the control samples with respect to the process-pattern relationship between marrow/grease extraction and frequencies of surface marking; and (iii) the energetic and mechanical uniformities linking rates of bone surface marking to the timing of carnivore and hominid access to long bone nutrients. © 1995 Academic Press.

The results of disturbance by mainly spotted hyaenas to simulated archaeological assemblages of hammerstone-broken bovid limb bones show that assemblages accumulated and fed upon by hominids first will nonetheless still be attractive to bone-ravaging carnivores. Such experimental assemblages usually show a virtually complete deletion of epiphyseal fragments, and a maximum incidence of tooth-marked long bone fragments of 45%, with an average of approximately 15%. The results therefore provide for the first time a quantified explanation of how an archaeological bone assemblage can come to bear traces of both taphonomic agents. Assemblages accumulated and fed upon first by spotted hyaenas, in contrast, preserve an incidence of tooth-marked long bone fragments in excess of 67% and averaging approximately 82%. The different intensities of tooth marking are accompanied by equally distinctive incidences of features of hammerstone breakage.

Notches are semicircular- to arcuate-shaped indentations on fracture edges with corresponding negative flake scars on medullary surfaces. We restrict our analysis to notches produced under controlled conditions by either carnivores or hammerstones when diaphyses are breached to extract marrow. Percussion notches are characteristically more frequent, and, in cortical view, broader and shallower than tooth notches. The flakes removed from percussion notches are typically broader, and have a more obtuse release angle, than those removed from tooth notches. These morphological differences are statistically significant for notches on Bovid Size 1 and 2 long bones but not on Bovid Size 3 long bones. Notches should be more durable than marks produced by carcass consumers on bone surfaces because they penetrate the entire thickness of the bone. As a result, notches are not easily obscured by weathering, chemical corrosion, or adhering matrix. Given this durability, and the initial success we have had in distinguishing the actor responsible for notch production on modern bones, notches can be used, with some limitations, to identify bone consumers archaeologically.

The control samples are realistic because they are based on natural history and paleoecological data collected from FLK 22, and other Olduvai Gorge assemblages; they are precise because independent experimental studies following the same methods have generated the same results; and they restore generality to the study of site formation because each one models a different hominid and/ or carnivore scenario of site formation.

In stage one, carnivores defleshed long bones, as inferred from the high percentage of tooth marks on midshaft fragments. In stage two, hominids processed intact long bones for marrow, as inferred from percussion mark percentages. Cut marks suggest that long bones retained flesh, but the amount, as yet, cannot be determined using cut mark percentages. In stage three, carnivores processed long bone epiphyses for grease, as inferred from the under-representation of long bone epiphyses and the high percentage of tooth marks on near-epiphyses and surviving epiphyses. The lack of comprehensive skeletal and surface mark data on cranial, axial, compact, and other specimens currently limits the application of experimental results. However, the available data suggest that the condition and representation of these items in the FLK 22 assemblage are also consistent with a carnivore to hominid to carnivore sequence of site formation. The variety of elements present, and their extensive processing by hominids, indicates that FLK 22 functioned as a central place/ refuge where hominids could transport a variety of carcass parts and process them in an unhurried fashion. The presence of numerous small and medium sized individuals also indicates that hominids could have passively scavenged carcasses from a number of different sources including lions, leopards, sabertooth cats, and mass drownings. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Actualistic studies; Comparability; Control samples; Dual- and multiple-patterning; Natural history; Paleoecology; Taphonomy","Bovidae; Felidae; Felis catus; Hominidae; Panthera leo; Animalia; Bovidae; Carnivora; Felis catus; Hominidae; carcass processing; hominid; paleoecology; taphonomy; animal; article; behavior; biological model; bone; Carnivora; evolution; feeding behavior; fossil; hominid; human; paleontology; physical anthropology; Tanzania; tooth; Animals; Behavior; Bone and Bones; Carnivora; Evolution; Feeding Behavior; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Biological; Paleodontology; Paleontology; Tanzania; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031277434

Recognition of the array of potential carnivores that may intervene in the consumption of carcass elements accumulated at archaeological sites may condition the way archaeologists reconstruct hominid-carnivore interaction and resource availability for both types of taphonomic agents. The development of techniques aimed at discerning carnivore taxa according to tooth mark location and size has proven problematic so far. The present work introduces new information, based on the use of tooth pit size, to determine the types of carnivores that have modified bone surfaces. It is concluded that tooth marks alone cannot be used to differentiate among specific taxa, unless the analysis of tooth pits is carried out taking into account their distribution and ranges of variation in large samples, together with other variables, such as the location of tooth marks according to bone section and element, and the anatomical distribution of furrowing. Even so, the attribution of specific bone damage to determined carnivores can only be confidently made when comparing small-sized versus large-sized carnivores. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Beyond this level of basic inference, it would be behaviorally informative if three deeper aspects of marrow harvesting were understood more clearly: (1) whether inter-element patterns of bone fragmentation vary when processing intensity is held constant; (2) whether butcher investment in marrow extraction correlates positively with the number of percussion marks generated; (3) whether taphonomic effectors can be identified based on percussion mark morphology, frequency and placement. Some experimental work has been conducted previously in service of exploring these questions, but we set out here to address them explicitly through the analysis of a large sample of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) limb elements fractured by hammerstone percussion. Our results indicate that (1) measures of bone fragmentation, which supposedly reflect processing intensity, are highly contingent on the research question being posed. This stresses the fact that researchers must be explicit in their definition of processing intensity. (2) In addition, hypothesized covariance between number of hammerstone blows and percussion mark frequencies are not met in our sample, corroborating previous conclusions of a lack of covariance between cutting strokes and cutmark frequencies. These results highlight the contingent nature of butchery mark production, and emphasize the need to investigate carcass resource exploitation by posing questions that do not rely on mark frequencies, but instead utilize other zooarchaeological measures. (3) Finally, our results - showing high incidences of impact notches and flakes created by direct anvil contact and ""anvil scratches"" created by direct hammerstone contact - suggest caution in using specific categories of percussion damage to infer their taphonomic effectors. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, empirical support for the scavenging hypothesis is still lacking. Recent data based on bone surface modifications from archaeological faunas suggest, in contrast, that hominids were primary agents of carcass exploitation. Meat seems to have been an important part of Plio-Pleistocene hominid diets. Passive scavenging scenarios show that this kind of opportunistic strategy cannot afford significant meat yields.

Various hypotheses depict hominids as either hunters and flesh-eaters, or as scavengers who mainly consumed marrow and brains. One of the main arguments advanced to support the scavenging hypothesis is that flesh-bearing medium-sized carcasses (weighing between 150 kg and 350 kg) at early sites could have been obtained from large felid kills. This paper presents the results of a preliminary study, in which I have analyzed lion-killed carcasses with respect to the availability and disposal of flesh and conspicuous carnivore-inflicted bone damage patterns, so as to have a reference that can be applied both to archaeofaunas and to actualistic experiments that try to model early human behavior. Bone damage made by lions overlaps the damage patterns caused by other carnivores, such as canids and hyenids, although it is not as intense. Scraps of flesh available after consumption are rare and show a typical anatomical distribution. The scavenging hypothesis is thus testable by comparing the distribution of cut marks on fossil archaeofaunas to the location of flesh in lions' kills. Comparisons between carcasses in different environments show that scraps of flesh can be obtained in open habitats. Carcasses consumed by lions in closed habitats are flesh depleted. The application of this referential framework to archaeological bone assemblages can help to identify hominid foraging strategies, and indirectly, trophic dynamics on savannas: scavenging in open habitats is only feasible in wet savannas with a slightly marked seasonality and lack of migratory biomass [M. Tappen (1992) Ph.D. Thesis, Dept. Anthropology, Harvard Univ., Cambridge, MA]; scavenging in closed habitats can only be made in semi-arid seasonal savannas whose biomass is subjected to migratory processes [R.J.

A majority of early archaeological bone assemblages bear evidence that both hominids and carnivores removed flesh and/or marrow from the bones. Whether flesh specialists (felids) or bone-crunchers (hyaenas), or both, fed upon the carcasses is crucial for deciphering the timing of hominid involvement with the assemblages. Here we present an initial attempt to differentiate the tooth mark signature inflicted on bones by a single carnivore species versus multiple carnivore taxa. Quantitative data on carnivore tooth pits, those resembling a tooth crown or a cusp, are presented for two characteristics: the area of the marks in millimetres, and the shape as determined by the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis of the mark. Tooth pits from bones modified by extant East African carnivores and latex impressions of tooth pits from extinct carnivore species are compared to those in the FLK Zinjanthropus bone assemblage. Data on tooth mark shape indicate greater variability in the Zinj sample than is exhibited by any individual extant or extinct carnivore species in the comparative sample. Data on tooth mark area demonstrate that bone density is related to the size of marks. Taken together, these data support the inference that felids defleshed bones in the Zinj assemblage and that hyaenas had final access to any grease or tissues that remained. © 2001 Academic Press.","Carnivore tooth marks; Methodology; Site formation; Taphonomy","carnivore; feeding; taphonomy; tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035003742

In some cases, however, the patterns of skeletal part representation and bone surface modification on which these criteria are ultimately based have been observed in fossil bone assemblages of unknown origin, rather than in modern assemblages of known origin. When the proposed criteria are evaluated within an actualistic framework, only three are able to differentiate between hominid- and hyena-created faunal assemblages. I suggest that only these three criteria - proportions of carnivores to ungulates in the assemblage, the preserved condition of long bone specimens (either as whole cylinders or as splintered shaft fragments), and the types of bone surface modifications - should be retained as important factors in a diagnosis of the ancient bone-collector. The remaining four criteria - the relative proportion of horn pieces in the assemblage, the relative representation of podial bones, the relative representation of small and large bovid skeletal parts, and bovid mortality profiles -are not relevant or applicable to the problem of differentiating hominid- from hyena-derived faunal assemblages.

As with most Palaeolithic sites, the behavioural interpretations offered for the Middle Stone Age (MSA) inhabitants of the KRM caves are based in large part on the interpretation of fragmentary faunal remains from the 'Main Site', or caves 1, 1A, 1B and 2 excavated in 1967-68 by Singer and Wymer (1982). Using zooarchaeological patterns detected in ethnoarchaeological data collected among Kua foragers of the eastern Kalahari, Central District, Botswana, as well as in data collected from Die Kelders Cave 1, Layer 10, South Africa, we offer an alternative explanation for a provocative pattern of skeletal part representation discovered in the KRM MSA archaeofauna over 20 years ago by Richard Klein (1976). The Klasies pattern is characterized by the underrepresentation of large bovid upper limb elements relative to more anatomically complete small bovids. To date, the pattern has been interpreted in three different ways, each with strikingly different implications for Middle Stone Age (MSA)/Middle Palaeolithic (MP) human behaviour. Understanding the nature of the pattern is not only important for reconstructing MSA human behaviour at KRM, but it is also important for understanding how the conduct of zooarchaeological analyses can profoundly influence our reconstructions of the course of human behavioural evolution. The Kua ethnoarchaeological data and experimental case studies unambiguously connect to site formation histories to zooarchaeological patterns. At Die Kelders Cave 1, Layer 10, the ethnoarchaeological expectations are expressed archaeologically in a context analytically relevant to KRM. Overall, by joining the Kua and the Die Kelders data, we show how uniformitarian/actualistic approaches can be productively employed in zooarchaeological interpretation. The 'Klasies Pattern' is likely to be an artefact of a widespread taphonomic sequence, followed by a particular style of analysis employed, for practical reasons, by many zooarchaeologists. We suggest that the situation is common and likely to be seriously distorting inferences about many archaeofaunas around the world. More generally we show how uniformitarian studies offer a coherent framework for developing methods and generating data useful in making behavioural inferences from faunal remains. Rather than a human behavioural signal in the KRM archaeofauna, the Klasies Pattern has more to do with the methods of zooarchaeology than with the behaviour of ancient people.","Ethnoarchaeology; Faunal analysis; Klasies river mouth; Middle palaeolithic; Middle stone age; Taphonomy; Zooarchaeology","archaeology; Paleolithic; Cape Province; South Africa; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033016442

A popular mechanistic explanation argues that reverse utility curves result from density-mediated destruction of bone, suggesting that utility-based studies will rarely be successful as density-mediated destruction will overwhelm any skeletal element patterning created by differential transport. We show with archaeological and experimental/naturalistic taphonomic data that the mechanistic explanation is overstated. Fauna from Kobeh cave (a Mousterian site) and 'Ain Dara (an Iron Age site) both show a reverse utility pattern when estimates of long bone abundance are based just on ends (the procedure followed at all sites that have shown a reverse utility pattern), and all bones are plotted together. When long bone abundance is estimated from the middle shaft portion, the reverse utility pattern collapses and a positive relationship arises. The ubiquity of the reverse utility curve derives in many cases from basing long bone abundance estimates on ends and scatter-plotting the abundance of long bones with non-long bones, thus restricting the analysis to the least dense most spongy bone panions. Long bone abundance estimates must include the middle shaft portion to attain accurate estimates of element abundance. Long bone abundance, when based on shaft portions, can be usefully compared to utility to investigate utility-based models of human behavior.

These inferences are often debated in part because frequency counts can vary widely among observers and because the carnivore taxa for which tooth mark dimensional data are available are limited. This study contributes to the body of actualistic/experimental tooth mark data and presents a methodology for collecting these data. We offer a greatly simplified method that may encourage others to collect and quantify tooth mark dimensions. We present dimensional data from feeding experiments with 16 omnivore and carnivore species of known age and mass, ranging in size from skunks to tigers, significantly expanding the taxonomic and size range of carnivores for which we have tooth pit data. Our results demonstrate considerable, but not complete, overlap in tooth pit dimensions among size, class, and taxon. Tooth mark dimensions on epiphyses and metaphyses were relatively strongly correlated with body mass, whereas diaphyseal tooth marks exhibited the weakest correlation. Human consumption of animal tissue produced tooth marks comparable in size to medium felids and small canids, suggesting the possibility that some tooth marks on Early Stone Age (ESA) faunal assemblages could, as suggested by Oliver (1994), result from small carnivore and/or hominin consumption. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Interpretations of leopard activity in these fossil caves were previously based upon reports of modern leopard behaviour in areas of southern Africa that were lacking in caves. In 1991 a leopard lair with an accompanying bone accumulation was discovered in a dolomitic cave on the John Nash Nature Reserve, South Africa. All of the bones in this cave could be unambiguously attributed to the activity of one individual leopard over a 1-year period. The resulting bone assemblage indicates that, when available, leopards will preferentially utilise the deep recesses of caves to the exclusion of trees when feeding, and that the size of prey leopards are capable of capturing, killing and transporting has previously been underestimated. The implications this may have for understanding the accumulation of fossils in the hominid-bearing caves of South Africa are that bones derived form leopards consuming prey in trees probably did not contribute significantly to the assemblages, and further that it is not necessary to invoke sabre-tooth cat involvement for the larger animals found in these assemblages. This modern cave probably represents a more appropriate model for the accumulation of bones in the fossil caves of the Sterkfontein Valley, and the assemblage is being continually monitored to view any and all taphonomic alterations that are occurring.

Body size explains much of the variability in marrow wet weights among and within bovid species, but locomotor adaptations and marrow cavity structure are also important, especially in explaining the lower absolute marrow yields of suid (warthog) and equid (zebra) long bones. When expressed in terms of actual kilocalorie content, variability in the absolute yield and skeletal distribution of marrow is increased among adults by fat-depletion attendant upon nutritional stress, and among subadults by incomplete fat deposition. Long bone marrow yields of sheep and caribou (Binford, Nunamiut Ethnoarchaeology, 1978; New York: Academic Press), upon which most economic analyses of zooarchaeological assemblages are based, are not representative of the variability seen in East African ungulates. Application of individual bovid Kcal models to Bunn’s (Journal of Human Evolution, 1986; 15, 673-690) data on long bone abundances at two Bed I archaeological sites from Olduvai Gorge suggests that hominids selectively broke those bones with higher energy yields from marrow.

The present study increases the range of experiments undertaken to understand the identification of hammerstone percussion (dynamic loading) and its differences from carnivore bone breakage through tooth pressure (static loading). This study contributes to a better understanding of frequencies of percussion marks, uncovers and quantifies those percussion marks that lack key diagnostic features to be identifiable and that could be mistaken with carnivore tooth marks, quantifies notch types, shows different size ranges for notches on bones from small and large fauna than previously reported, quantifies the proportion of notches bearing percussion marks, and introduces new size data for percussion (impact) flakes and percussion marks. Furthermore, all these variables have been applied to a dual experimental set: one experiment using non-modified hammerstones and another based on the use of modified hammerstones.

These modifications change the rate of decomposition, the pattern of insect succession, and the context of associations, thus altering estimations of time since death. A controlled feeding study with captive wolves and road-killed deer is pertinent to understanding canid scavenging and how scavenging may alter postmortem changes. During feeding, the wolves commonly dismember and devour the deer in a predictable sequence.

It provides a high-resolution approach to cut mark characterisation such as morphology, depth, width, and angle estimation as well as section determination, measured directly on the marks on bones. Macro-photogrammetry records quantitative and qualitative information which can be statistically processed with standard multivariate and geometric morphometric tools. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer vision; Cut marks; Image-based modelling; Macro-photogrammetry; Taphonomy","archaeological evidence; bone; image analysis; micromorphology; modeling; photogrammetry; taphonomy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939196614

The first paper discusses a particular set of ways to compare learning algorithms, according to which there are no distinctions between learning algorithms. This second paper concentrates on different ways of comparing learning algorithms from those used in the first paper. In particular this second paper discusses the associated a priori distinctions that do exist between learning algorithms. In this second paper it is shown, loosely speaking, that for loss functions other than zero-one (e.g., quadratic loss), there are a priori distinctions between algorithms. However, even for such loss functions, it is shown here that any algorithm is equivalent on average to its ""randomized"" version, and in this still has no first principles justification in terms of average error. Nonetheless, as this paper discusses, it may be that (for example) cross-validation has better head-to-head minimax properties than ""anti-cross-validation"" (choose the learning algorithm with the largest cross-validation error). This may be true even for zero-one loss, a loss function for which the notion of ""randomization"" would not be relevant. This paper also analyzes averages over hypotheses rather than targets. Such analyses hold for all possible priors over targets. Accordingly they prove, as a particular example, that cross-validation cannot be justified as a Bayesian procedure. In fact, for a very natural restriction of the class of learning algorithms, one should use anti-cross-validation rather than cross-validation (!).",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000459352

(In press) presented a new method and criteria for distinguishing between fractures imparted by hominid hammerstone percussion and carnivores chewing on 'green' limb bones of ungulates. The method uses a combination of fracture plane and fracture angle data that are useful for elucidating the relative role of hominids in the accumulation of prehistoric archaeofaunas, especially when employed in concert with other classes of taphonomic data. We briefly summarise the method and apply it to the ungulate limb bone subassemblage from Swartkrans Member 3, a c. 1.0 million year old site from South Africa that preserves Early Stone Age lithic artefacts, hominid fossils, and an abundant mammalian fauna with cutmarked, hammerstone-percussed and burned bone specimens. Results of the fracture pattern analysis corroborate indications from other lines of taphonomic data that there was minimal carnivore-hominid interdependence in the formation of the fauna, and that carnivores were probably responsible for the majority of the bone collection in Member 3. However, we also document a significant hominid influence on assemblage formation, a finding that expands and refines our understanding of large animal carcass foraging by hominids in southern Africa during the early Pleistocene.

Some common pitfalls of these methods when used to analyze fossil specimens are: (1) ignoring the possibility that a fossil belongs to a group other than one of the predefined reference samples (i.e., restricted versus unrestricted approaches to classification), (2) misinterpreting probabilities of group membership (i.e., posterior versus typicality probabilities), and (3) failing to understand how sample sizes influence multivariate ordinations in trying to effectively illustrate the morphometric affinities of a fossil (i.e., weighted versus unweighted analyses with fossils entered indirectly or directly into the analysis). To better understand canonincal variate analysis and generalized distances, the workings of these methods are portrayed graphically as a series of rotations and rescaling of data plotted in a multivariate data space. The influence of sample sizes and the importance of higher-numberer canonical variates are emphasized. Simple examples taken from the literature illustrate how the different approaches to including a fosil in canonical variate analysis may affect the multivariate results upon which physical anthropologists base their interpretations of the fossil's morphology. © 1992 International Institute for the Study of Man.","Fossils; Morphometrics; Multivariate Analysis",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-51649138090

Spotted hyenas of the Italian peninsula consumed essentially the same ungulate species as Paleolithic humans did, and both of these predators depended heavily on bone marrow. Wolves tended to consume more hillside-adapted ungulates in the same area and period, suggesting some spatial separation of the three predators according to topography. There is complete overlap in the prey age groups commonly harvested by spotted hyenas and wolves, but pronounced differences between this pair of predators and Paleolithic humans of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods; from the narrow perspective of ungulate exploitation, Middle and Upper Paleolithic humans were quite similar. Taken together, there is good evidence for niche separation among the three ungulate predators during the Late Pleistocene in Italy. The intensity of bone transport to and modification at dens by hyenas varied greatly with circumstance and prey body size, indicating that prey size must be carefully controlled in comparisons of predator behavior. Populations of wolves and humans appear to have expanded toward the end of spotted hyenas' tenure on the Italian peninsula, and disappearance of the spotted hyenas from Eurasia may be best explained by rapid transformations of ecosystem structure associated with global warming after 13 KYA.","Cave sites; Italy; Paleolithic humans; Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta); Taphononomy; Wolves (Canis lupus); Zooarchaeology","mammal; paleobiogeography; Paleolithic; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Southern Europe; World; Canidae; Canis; Canis familiaris; Canis lupus; Crocuta crocuta; Ungulata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17744385516

The present study confirms that lions efficiently deflesh small and medium-sized carcasses and they can even thoroughly deflesh carcasses heavier than 500 kg, such as those of buffaloes. Ecology plays a major role in the intensity with which lions deflesh their prey. The most intensive carcass consumption episodes in Tarangire were documented in alluvial environments near water. Bone damage is proportional to the intensity of carcass consumption and upper limb bones, usually the most defleshed elements, are also the most heavily damaged. Butchery experiments with stone tools modelling secondary access to lion kills yielded a low cut mark frequency with an anatomical distribution of cut marks occurring more frequently on intermediate than on upper limb bones and on ends and metadiaphyses than on mid-shafts. The combination of the damage inflicted by lions on bones and the occurrence of cut marks as the result of secondary-access butchery by humans provides a heuristic framework with which to understand similar patterns in the archaeological record. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893830313

The overlap of their ecological niches has raised an important debate on the role that carnivores played in archaeological site formation. Different analytical techniques differentiate the action of carnivores and humans and identify the type of carnivore involved of which tooth mark analyses are prominent. However, available taphonomic studies present some limitations given the great overlap among tooth mark sizes from different carnivores, enabling only the distinction of size groups, not specific carnivores. In this work, we use a new technique combining three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and geometric morphometrics (GMM) of tooth pits on equid and bovid bone created by different carnivores (including crocodiles, hyenas, jaguars, lions and wolves) in controlled settings. The 3D methodology we present isolates and differentiates tooth marks generated by different carnivores. We also test the applicability of the technique to ascribe tooth pits recorded on some hominin specimens from FLK Zinj and FLKNN 3 (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). The tooth marks on the Olduvai OH8 and OH35 hominin fossils, previously assigned to crocodiles show that while OH8 tooth pit morphology falls in the range created by crocodiles, the pits on OH35 can not be interpreted as crocodile-inflicted marks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Geometric morphometrics; Homo habilis; Micro-photogrammetry; Taphonomy; Tooth marks","archaeology; bone; carnivore; crocodilian; feeding behavior; fossil record; geometry; hominid; morphometry; Olduvai event; photogrammetry; reconstruction; taphonomy; three-dimensional modeling; tooth; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania; Bovidae; Canidae; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Equidae; Homo habilis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019375211

Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classification have been suggested. Different techniques, such as three-dimensional digital microscope (3D DM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) have been recently applied to the study of cut marks. Although the 3D DM and LSCM microscopic techniques are the most commonly used for the 3D identification of cut marks, M-PG has also proved to be very efficient and a low-cost method. M-PG is a noninvasive technique that allows the study of the cortical surface without any previous preparation of the samples, and that generates high-resolution models. Despite the current application of microscopic and micro-photogrammetric techniques to taphonomy, their reliability has never been tested. In this paper, we compare 3D DM, LSCM and M-PG in order to assess their resolution and results. In this study, we analyse 26 experimental cut marks generated with a metal knife.

One of them is related to the action of carnivores, which is reflected in conspicuous tooth marks, such as pits, scores, punctures or furrowing. Different carnivores damage bone assemblages differently. Thus, several researches have tried to identify carnivore agency based on different parameters such as skeletal profiles, tooth mark frequencies and dimensions, breakage patterns, or more recently, taphotypes. Here we propose a new methodology based on the analysis of tooth scores to determine the carnivore type involved in bone modification. For this purpose, we have built 3D models of several tooth scores produced by wolves, lions, jaguars, foxes and hyenas using photogrammetric techniques. These models were later analyzed by means of Geometric Morphometrics and multivariate statistics. We show that although there is a high degree of overlap in tooth mark morphology, the combined action of tooth score dimensions and morphology enables the identification of some of the tooth scores made by lions from those of the other carnivores with a higher degree of confidence than any other inter-carnivore comparison. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer vision; Image-based modelling; Micro-Photogrammetry; Scores; Taphonomy of carnivores; Tooth marks",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019725876

This enables statistically-based classification and interpretations. The accuracy of these interpretations depends on the accuracy of the analogical frameworks applied. The new method shows that bone damage patterns differ according to carcass type and size. They also differ depending on environmental conditions (captive and wild carnivores). The method is also useful to detect the type of carnivores involved in the modification of epiphyseal portions. This opens the door to interpretations of hominin-carnivore interactions and the resulting strategies of carcass acquisition strategies by hominins. The application of the method to a sample of epiphyseal portions from two archaeological sites from Olduvai Gorge (BK and FLK N) shows its potential resolution. BK has been previously interpreted as a hominin-carnivore assemblage, whereas FLK N has been interpreted as a felid-accumulated assemblage.

The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks– 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores–were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished. © 2018 Yravedra et al.

Different criteria have been suggested for the description and classification of cut marks. The methods commonly used for the study of cut marks rely on high-cost microscopy techniques with low portability (i.e., inability to work in situ), such as the 3D digital microscope (3D DM) or laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Recently, new algorithmic developments in the field of computer vision and photogrammetry, have achieved very high precision and resolution, offering a portable and low-cost alternative to microscopic techniques. However, the photogrammetric techniques present some disadvantages, such as longer data collection and processing time, and the requirement of some photogrammetric expertise for the calibration of the cameras and the acquisition of precise image orientation. In this paper, we compare two low-cost techniques and their application to cut mark studies: the micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) technique presented, developed, and validated previously, and a methodology based on the use of a structured light scanner (SLS). A total of 47 experimental cut marks, produced using a stainless steel knife, were analyzed. The data registered through virtual reconstruction was analyzed by means of three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (GMM). © 2017 by the authors.","Bones; Cut marks; Low-cost; Micro-photogrammetry; Statistical agreement; Structured light laser scanner","Bone; Costs; Data handling; Digital devices; Laser applications; Scanning; Stainless steel; Cut marks; Geometric morphometrics; Laser scanner; Laser scanning confocal microscopy; Low costs; Photogrammetric technique; Statistical comparisons; Virtual reconstruction; Photogrammetry",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029389739

Taphonomic research is used to discern which agents (carnivores, humans or both) generate the bone assemblages recovered at archaeological sites. Taphonomic frameworks developed during the last decades show that the only large-sized carnivores in African biomes able to create bone assemblages are leopards and hyenas. A carnivore-made bone assemblage located in the short-grassland ecological unit of the Serengeti (within Olduvai Gorge) was studied. Taphonomic analyses of this assemblage including skeletal part representation, bone density, breakage patterns and anatomical distribution of tooth marks, along with an ecological approach to the prey selection made by large carnivores of the Serengeti, were carried out. The results show that this bone assemblage may be the first lion-accumulated assemblage documented, although other carnivores (namely spotted hyenas) may have also intervened through postdepositional ravaging. This first faunal assemblage potentially created by lions constitutes a new framework for neotaphonomic studies. Since lions may accumulate carcasses under exceptional circumstances, such as those documented at the site reported here, this finding may have important consequences for interpretations of early archaeological and paleontological sites, which provide key information about human evolution.",,"animal; archeology; bone; bone density; ecology; environment; evolution; feeding behavior; fossil; hominid; hyena; lion; paleontology; Panthera; physiology; procedures; Tanzania; tooth; Animals; Archaeology; Biological Evolution; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Ecology; Environment; Feeding Behavior; Fossils; Hominidae; Hyaenidae; Lions; Paleontology; Panthera; Tanzania; Tooth",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019661387

Thus, metal tool use has been differentiated in contexts with an abundance of lithic tools, or even the use of hand axes has been documented in carcass processing, in contrast with simple unretouched or retouched flakes. As important as this information is, there are still other important aspects to be analysed. Can cut marks produced with different lithic raw material types be differentiated? Can cut marks made with different types of the same raw material type be characterized and differentiated? The objective of this study is to evaluate if cut marks resulting from the use of different flints and different quartzites are distinguishable from each other. In the present work, an experimental analysis of hundreds of cut marks produced by five types of flint and five varieties of quartzite was carried out. Microphotogrammetry and geometric–morphometric techniques were applied to analyse these cut marks. The results show that flint cut marks and quartzite cut marks can be characterized at the assemblage level. Different types of flint produced cut marks that were not significantly different from each other. Cut marks made with Olduvai Gorge quartzite were significantly different from those produced with a set comprising several other types of quartzites. Crystal size, which is larger in Olduvai Gorge quartzites (0.5 mm) than Spanish quartzites (177–250 μm), is discussed as being the main reason for these statistically significant differences. This documented intra-sample and inter-sample variance does not hinder the resolution of the approach to differentiate between these two generic raw material types and opens the door for the application of this method in archaeological contexts. © 2017 University of Oxford","cut marks; flint; micro-morphometry; micro-photogrammetry; quartzite; raw materials","archaeology; flint; lithic fragment; morphometry; photogrammetry; quartzite; tool use",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028314535

Alternatively, taphonomic studies on bone surface modifications and bone breakage patterns, have provided heuristic interpretations of some of the best preserved archaeological record of this period; namely, the Olduvai Bed I sites. The most recent and comprehensive taphonomic study of these sites (Domínguez-Rodrigo et al., 2007a) showed that FLK Zinj was an anthropogenic assemblage in which hominins acquired carcasses via primary access. That study also showed that the other sites were palimpsests with minimal or no intervention by hominins. The FLK N, FLK NN and DK sequence seemed to be dominated by single-agent (mostly, felid) or multiple-agent (mostly, felid-hyenid) processes. The present study re-analyzes the Bed I sites focusing on skeletal part profiles. Machine learning methods, which incorporate complex algorithms, are powerful predictive and classification methods and have the potential to better extract information from skeletal part representation than past approaches. Here, multiple algorithms (via decision trees, neural networks, random forests and support vector machines) are combined to produce a solid interpretation of bone accumulation agency at the Olduvai Bed I sites. This new approach virtually coincides with previous taphonomic interpretations on a site by site basis and shows that felids were dominant accumulating agents over hyenas during Bed I times. The recent discovery of possibly a modern lion-accumulated assemblage at Olduvai Gorge (Arriaza et al., submitted) provides a very timely analog for this interpretation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Felid; Hominin; Hyenid; Machine learning; MAU; Skelelal element; Taphonomy","Artificial intelligence; Bone; Classification (of information); Complex networks; Decision trees; Multi agent systems; Musculoskeletal system; Felid; Hominin; Hyenid; Skelelal element; Taphonomy; Learning systems; analytical method; archaeological evidence; bone; felid; fossil assemblage; geological record; hominid; machine learning; Pleistocene; prediction; skeletal remains; taphonomy; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania; Felidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960970713

Crucial evolutionary features, such as the origin of stone tool use, meat-eating, food-sharing, cooperation and sociality can only be addressed through confident identification and interpretation of BSM, and more specifically, cut marks. Recently, it has been argued that linear marks with the same properties as cut marks can be created by crocodiles, thereby questioning whether secure cut mark identifications can be made in the Early Pleistocene fossil record. Powerful classification methods based on multivariate statistics and machine learning (ML) algorithms have previously successfully discriminated cut marks from most other potentially confounding BSM. However, crocodile-made marks were marginal to or played no role in these comparative analyses.

Although a few artifacts have been discovered in the vicinity of AMK, the site was mostly naturally (i.e., non-anthropogenically) formed.

In some cases, classification may reach an accuracy of 100%. No other statistical tool commonly used in taphonomy had been this successful at classification before. However, the heuristics of ML algorithms depend tightly on the objectivity in raw data collection. The use of multivariate approaches in which variables are independently scored by the analyst introduces a subjective bias. In this work, I show that different analysts producing raw data on the same testing data set can lead to widely divergent BSM classifications and interpretations using the same powerful ML algorithms. It is emphasized that until an objective non-biasing method of raw data collection is implemented, BSM classification carried out via statistical tests will remain heuristically limited. As a consequence, the application of these referents to archeological BSM does not guarantee a correct interpretation beyond the analyst expertise. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Algorithm; Bone surface modification; Cut marks; Machine learning; Taphonomy; Trampling marks",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053340004

Its age makes it a key site for studying the behavior of the early hominin groups of the Iberian Peninsula and western Europe and the ecological context in which they developed.At La Mina locality, three archaeostratigraphic levels have been identified, with level 2 being the richest in terms of the archaeological remains recovered. It exhibits high taxonomic diversity, with the most common taxa belonging to open and partially open habitats, although aquatic and riparian taxa have also been identified. Carnivore remains are present, although scarce. Coprolites from a hyaenid have also been found.Both hominin and carnivore activity has been documented at the site. Evidence of carnivore activity suggests at least one bone-cracking carnivore had access to the assemblage. The anatomical ratios employed suggest that La Mina was formed at a time of high competition (intra and/or inter-specific), with a high number of predators in this ecological context. Anthropic activity in a highly competitive context might suggest that these hominin groups had a high degree of control over the environment and over local resources, as has been shown at other Early Pleistocene sites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Competition among predators; Iberian Peninsula; Late Early Pleistocene; Ravaging; Taphonomy; Zooarchaeology","archaeology; carnivore; coexistence; competition (ecology); human settlement; lithostratigraphy; Paleolithic; predator; taphonomy; zoology; Catalonia; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]; Hyaenidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958925024

Discerning carnivore involvement in the archaeo-paleontological record during the Plio-Pleistocene is especially important due to the capability of several carnivores of creating bone assemblages, to the interaction with other species in the modification of bones across the landscape and to the potential interspecific competition (e.g., with other carnivores or hominins). Several variables have been explored to discern the carnivore taxa involved in bone modification, but most of them led to equifinality. Recently, the application of computer vision and geometric morphometric techniques for the reconstruction of tooth mark morphology has provided satisfactory results in terms of differentiating among carnivore taxa with similar body size. Here we apply this new technique to the study of pits from the Olduvai Carnivore site (OCS), which has been interpreted as the first bone assemblage generated by lions and subsequently ravaged by hyenas. Results support the lions' involvement and post-ravaging action of hyenas in the OCS assemblage. Lastly, we also explore the potential of applying these new techniques to other bone assemblages in which different carnivore taxa were involved in their modification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","FLK Zinj; Geometric morphometry; Hyena; Lion; Pits; Structured light scanner","archaeological evidence; felid; morphometry; paleontology; taphonomy; tooth; Felidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057827524

Available experimental analogies aim at differentiating agencies in the production of fractured bones. Possible equifinality presented by different agents can hinder the characterisation of bone breakage at archaeological sites. Equally important is the potential distortion that bone-breaking processes introduce in bone surface modification (BSM) frequencies. This study presents an experimental approach to the problem of identifying signatures for anthropogenic bone breaking as a product of direct hammerstone percussion. This study also contributes to improving the existing analogical framework on processes related to bone breakage of medium-sized animals (80–200 kg), since most previous experimentation has focused on smaller (10–80 kg) and larger (200–800 kg) carcasses. It has been possible to verify the existence of non-random and non-intentional breakage patterns on long bones due to their shape and structural properties. Thus, this introduces the possibility of correctly identifying anthropogenic fracture patterns in the archaeological record. Additionally, it also opens up the possibility of finding different cultural patterns. It has frequently been argued that the frequency of bone surface modifications correlates with fragmentation intensity. However, this assertion remained untested until now. Here, we test the frequency and occurrence of percussion and cut marks in faunal assemblages according to the intensity of green bone fragmentation. The results also improve the current referential framework in reference to interpretation of notches produced by dynamic loading. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Breakage patterns; Butchery; Notches; Randomness; Taphonomy","archaeology; bone; experimental study; loading; taphonomy; Animalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047385353
