After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

Sequence analysis of equids from archaeological sites and late Pleistocene deposits showed that this diversity was not due to an accelerated mutation rate or an ancient domestication event.

Since that time the field of geometric morphometrics has matured into a rich and cohesive discipline for the study of shape variation and covariation. The development of the field is identified with the Procrustes paradigm, a methodological approach to shape analysis arising from the intersection of the statistical shape theory and analytical procedures for obtaining shape variables from landmark data. In this review we describe the Procrustes paradigm and the current methodological toolkit of geometric morphometrics. We highlight some of the theoretical advances that have occurred over the past ten years since our prior review (Adams et al., 2004), what types of anatomical structures are amenable to these approaches, and how they extend the reach of geometric morphometrics to more specialized applications for addressing particular biological hypotheses. We end with a discussion of some possible areas that are fertile ground for future development in the field. © 2013 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.","Morphology; Procrustes analysis; Shape analysis; Statistics",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875767161

Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Canonical variate analysis; Linear discriminant function; Ordination; Principal component analysis; Procrustes; Selection gradient",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952312407

Breed standards make known which features were selected by breeders. Here we use the methods of geometric morphometrics to study change of skull shape in a series of purebred St Bernard dogs spanning nearly 120 years. A regression of shape on time was highly significant and revealed a consistent trend of shape change that corresponded to the features deemed desirable by the breed standard. Historical shape change in St Bernards involves a broadening of the skull and a tilting of the palate and upper jaw relative to the rest of the skull. This trend appears to be linear throughout the entire period and appears to be continuing. Allometry was ruled out as a contributing factor to this change because there was no consistent trend of historical change in skull size and because neither the patterns of static nor ontogenetic allometry corresponded to the historical shape change. The dramatic modification of the St Bernard skull demonstrates that selection can achieve sustained and substantial change and can completely overcome constraints such as allometry. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Allometry; Canis familiaris; Evolutionary rate; Geometric morphometrics; Procrustes analysis","allometry; canid; evolution; geometry; morphology; morphometry; skull; allometry; animal tissue; article; breed; controlled study; dog; geometry; history; maxilla; morphology; morphometrics; nonhuman; ontogeny; palate; priority journal; skull; Canis familiaris",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-36349010900

Adding these sequences to previously published data, the total comes to 652, the largest currently available database. From these sequences, a phylogenetic network was constructed that showed that most of the 93 different mitochondrial (mt)DNA types grouped into 17 distinct phylogenetic clusters. Several of the clusters correspond to breeds and/or geographic areas, notably cluster A2, which is specific to Przewalski's horses, cluster C1, which is distinctive for northern European ponies, and cluster D1, which is well represented in Iberian and northwest African breeds.

The precise origins and dispersal routes of the Austronesian peoples and the associated Lapita culture remain contentious, and numerous disparate models of dispersal (based primarily on linguistic, genetic, and archeological data) have been proposed. Here, through the use of mtDNA from 781 modern and ancient Sus specimens, we provide evidence for an early human-mediated translocation of the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) to Flores and Timor and two later separate human-mediated dispersals of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) through Island Southeast Asia into Oceania. Of the later dispersal routes, one is unequivocally associated with the Neolithic (Lapita) and later Polynesian migrations and links modern and archeological Javan, Sumatran, Wallacean, and Oceanic pigs with mainland Southeast Asian S. scrofa. Archeological and genetic evidence shows these pigs were certainly introduced to islands east of the Wallace Line, including New Guinea, and that so-called ""wild"" pigs within this region are most likely feral descendants of domestic pigs introduced by early agriculturalists. The other later pig dispersal links mainland East Asian pigs to western Micronesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines. These results provide important data with which to test current models for human dispersal in the region. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Domestication; mtDNA; Pacific colonization; Phylogeography","mitochondrial DNA; animal tissue; article; DNA determination; domestic pig; geological time; migration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Pacific islands; paleoanthropology; paleoenvironment; phylogeography; population movement pattern; priority journal; Southeast Asia; swine; unindexed sequence; animal; Bayes theorem; genetics; geography; haplotype; history; molecular genetics; phylogeny; population migration; principal component analysis; swine; Gabaza; Suidae; Sus; Sus celebensis; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica; Animal Migration; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; Bayes Theorem; DNA, Mitochondrial; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceania; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Swine",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247626810

In the last decade, significant technological and methodological advances in both molecular biology and archaeology have revolutionized the study of plant and animal domestication and are reshaping our understanding of the transition from foraging to farming, one of the major turning points in human history. This groundbreaking volume for the first time brings together leading archaeologists and biologists working on the domestication of both plants and animals to consider a wide variety of archaeological and genetic approaches to tracing the origin and dispersal of domesticates. It provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in this quickly changing field as well as reviews of recent findings on specific crop and livestock species in the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa. Offering a unique global perspective, it explores common challenges and potential avenues for future progress in documenting domestication. © 2006 by The Regents of the University of California.",,,Book,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887758894

They then spread across the Middle and Near East and westward into Europe alongside early agriculturalists. European pigs were either domesticated independently or more likely appeared so as a result of admixture between introduced pigs and European wild boar. As a result, European wild boar mtDNA lineages replaced Near Eastern/Anatolian mtDNA signatures in Europe and subsequently replaced indigenous domestic pig lineages in Anatolia. The specific details of these processes, however, remain unknown. To address questions related to early pig domestication, dispersal, and turnover in the Near East, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA and dental geometric morphometric variation in 393 ancient pig specimens representing 48 archeological sites (from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic to the Medieval period) from Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Our results reveal the first genetic signatures of early domestic pigs in the Near Eastern Neolithic core zone. We also demonstrate that these early pigs differed genetically from those in western Anatolia that were introduced to Europe during the Neolithic expansion. In addition, we present a significantly more refined chronology for the introduction of European domestic pigs into Asia Minor that took place during the Bronze Age, at least 900 years earlier than previously detected. By the 5th century AD, European signatures completely replaced the endemic lineages possibly coinciding with the widespread demographic and societal changes that occurred during the Anatolian Bronze and Iron Ages. © 2012 The Author 2012.

This methodological paper examines approaches to optimizing the classification of specimens based on their outlines. This study examines the performance of four approaches to the mathematical representation of outlines and two different approaches to curve measurement as applied to a collection of feather outlines. A new approach to the dimension reduction necessary to carry out a CVA on this type of outline data with modest sample sizes is also presented, and its performance is compared to two other approaches to dimension reduction. Results: Two semi-landmark-based methods, bending energy alignment and perpendicular projection, are shown to produce roughly equal rates of classification, as do elliptical Fourier methods and the extended eigenshape method of outline measurement. Rates of classification were not highly dependent on the number of points used to represent a curve or the manner in which those points were acquired. The new approach to dimensionality reduction, which utilizes a variable number of principal component (PC) axes, produced higher cross-validation assignment rates than either the standard approach of using a fixed number of PC axes or a partial least squares method. Conclusion: Classification of specimens based on feather shape was not highly dependent of the details of the method used to capture shape information. The choice of dimensionality reduction approach was more of a factor, and the cross validation rate of assignment may be optimized using the variable number of PC axes method presented herein. © 2006 Sheets et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749530871

On the basis of current evidence from archaeology, mitochondrial DNA, and Y-chromosomal sequencing, a number of different domestication scenarios have been proposed, ranging from the spread of domestic horses out of a restricted primary area of domestication to the domestication of numerous distinct wild horse populations. In this paper, we reconstruct both the population genetic structure of the extinct wild progenitor of domestic horses, Equus ferus, and the origin and spread of horse domestication in the Eurasian steppes by fitting a spatially explicit stepping-stone model to genotype data from >300 horses sampled across northern Eurasia. We find strong evidence for an expansion of E. ferus out of eastern Eurasia about 160 kya, likely reflecting the colonization of Eurasia by this species. Our best-fitting scenario further suggests that horse domestication originated in the western part of the Eurasian steppe and that domestic herdswere repeatedly restockedwith local wild horses as they spread out of this area. By showing that horse domestication was initiated in the western Eurasian steppe and that the spread of domestic herds across Eurasia involved extensive introgression from the wild, the scenario of horse domestication proposed here unites evidence from archaeology, mitochondrial DNA, and Y-chromosomal DNA.","Demic spread; Demography; Microsatellites","mitochondrial DNA; archeology; article; Asia; domestication; female; genotype; horse; male; nonhuman; population genetic structure; priority journal; steppe; Y chromosome; Algorithms; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Animals, Wild; Archaeology; Asia; DNA, Mitochondrial; Europe; Genetics, Population; Horses; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Y Chromosome; Equidae; Equus caballus; Equus ferus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861428712

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

Using molar shape geometric morphometric analysis, archaeological Sus dental series from the Sarawak caves of Niah (Aceramic, Neolithic) and Lobang Kudih (Ming period), are compared with extant ISEA wild pigs to establish their taxonomic status and to further explore the evidence for local domestication or introduction of allochthonous populations. Results on modern data-sets show that outline analysis of the third lower molar achieves highly significant inter- and intra-specific differentiation among ISEA wild pigs, with a phenotypic divergence structure displaying congruence with molecular phylogenies. Both tooth shape and mtDNA evidence strongly suggest the so-called wild pigs of New Guinea to be the descendants of pigs domesticated in mainland South East Asia and introduced by early farmers to ISEA. None of our data provide clear evidence for a Neolithic introduction of domesticated pigs, or for the local domestication of indigenous bearded pigs, since all Aceramic and Neolithic pigs from Niah cave have been identified as indigenous bearded pig (Sus barbatus). Local domestication experiments by foragers have not been ruled out, since evidence of hypoplasia as a marker of domestication processes has been observed. Introduction of allochthonous domestic pigs between the Late Neolithic and the Metal Age is suggested, since this small domestic breed from Lobang Kudih cave displays strong phenetic relationships with S. scrofa of New Guinea, recognised by molecular phylogeography as part of the 'Pacific Clade' linked both with Lapita and Polynesian dispersals. Introduction of celebensis-like species has also been suggested. Future studies should incorporate broader time-scale and geographical framework data-sets to strengthen these assumptions.

We based this appreciation upon the detailed morphology of the distal part of the metapodials. Landmark approaches were applied to archaeological and palaeontological samples from three distinct areas: Switzerland Plateau, Paris Basin, and Charente (France). Little differences of isometric size characterized the three regional samples. Multivariate analyses of shape (principal component analysis, discriminant, canonical variates and neural network analyses) revealed similar sets of complex shape features on both metacarpals and metatarsals. In addition, regional groups appeared clearly differentiated by well defined shape patterns, the functional implications of which remain to be established. These results evidence the existence of a regional structuration of populations (particularly clear on the CVA of both metacarpals and metatarsals) suggesting the absence of long distance migrations. Finally, it appears that the distinction between size and shape systematically operated by geometric morphometrics can provide better insights into the study of the mobility of ancient populations. Geometric morphometrics approaches such as 3D Procrustes superimpositions, appear therefore to be of great interest for archaeological purposes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A 247-bp mitochondrial D-loop sequence from 182 modern samples revealed a total of 70 haplotypes with a high level of genetic diversity. Seven major mtDNA haplogroups (A-G) and 16 clusters were identified for the 182 Chinese modern horses. In the present study, nine 247-bp mitochondrial D-loop sequences of ancient remains of Bronze Age horse from the Chifeng region of Inner Mongolia in China (c. 4000-2000a bp) were used to explore the origin and diversity of Chinese modern horses and the phylogenetic relationship between ancient and modern horses. The nine ancient horses carried seven haplotypes with rich genetic diversity, which were clustered together with modern individuals among haplogroups A, E and F. Modern domestic horse and ancient horse data support the multiple origins of domestic horses in China. This study supports the argument that multiple successful events of horse domestication, including separate introductions of wild mares into the domestic herds, may have occurred in antiquity, and that China cannot be excluded from these events. Indeed, the association of Far Eastern mtDNA types to haplogroup F was highly significant using Fisher's exact test of independence (P = 0.00002), lending support for Chinese domestication of this haplogroup. High diversity and all seven mtDNA haplogroups (A-G) with 16 clusters also suggest that further work is necessary to shed more light on horse domestication in China. © 2009 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics.","Archaeology; Chinese horse; Haplogroup; Mitochondrial DNA D-loop; Origin","mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; China; classification; genetics; horse; mitochondrion; phylogeny; Animals; China; DNA, Mitochondrial; Horses; Mitochondria; Phylogeny; Equidae; Equus caballus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449411581

The spread of hipparionine horses is associated with increased seasonality and the expansion of open habitats. It is generally accepted that anchitheriine horses did not display an evolutionary increase in tooth crown height prior to their extinction. Nevertheless, to test whether anchitheriines showed any changes interpretable as adaptation to local conditions, we analyzed molar teeth from multiple populations of Anchitherium in three dimensions. Our results show differences in tooth morphology that suggest incipient hypsodonty in Spain, the first region experiencing increasingly arid conditions in the early Miocene of Europe. Furthermore, analyses of tooth wear show that Spanish specimens cluster with present ungulates that eat foliage together with grasses and shrubs, whereas German specimens cluster with present-day ungulates that eat mostly foliage. Taken together, even a taxon such as Anchitherium, with a long and successful history of forest adaptation, did respond to regional environmental changes in an adaptive manner. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Anchitherium; Dental durability; GIS; Miocene; Palaeodiet; Three-dimensional (3D) scanning; Tooth crown height; Tooth wear","adaptation; arid environment; climatic region; foliage; fossil record; GIS; grass; horse; Miocene; shrub; tooth; animal; article; climate; evolution; fossil; genetics; horse; tooth; Animals; Climate; Evolution; Fossils; Horses; Tooth; Spain; Anchitheriinae; Anchitherium; Equidae; Mammalia; Poaceae; Ungulata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-75149165776

In order to match them automatically with climatic data, localities were referenced within a 2° worldwide grid system using geographical information system software. The mesowear score was used as a proxy variable to test the covariance of diet with mean annual precipitation, evapotranspiration, mean annual climatic water balance and mean annual temperature. Seven of the nine equid species presented mesowear signatures indicating a grass-dominated diet, and we found interspecific as well as intraspecific variability. Non-gramineous food components shifted the equilibrium towards the attrition-dominated end in E. africanus and E. khur, indicating an intermediate diet. Especially in E.zebra, additional sources of exogenous abrasives (grit and soil) might increase dietary abrasiveness. In E.quagga, dietary flexibility and the capability to cope with increased abrasiveness are considered keystone factors allowing its large geographical range. The broad, species-specific range of climate parameters associated with the habitats was used to define the thresholds of the species' feeding niches. Our data suggest that climate as represented by the variables we used does not, in the first instance, relate to the tooth wear signature of equids. We thus conclude that the tooth wear signature is more specific to the feeding strategy and should be regarded a dietary trait rather than an immediate imprint of climate. However, tooth wear can be used to infer local dietary traits and might therefore become an important tool in conservation management. © 2013 Mammal Society/Blackwell Publishing.","Abiotic habitat variables; Dietary adaptation; Horse; Resource partitioning; Wild ass","abrasion; conservation management; covariance analysis; diet; evapotranspiration; feeding ecology; GIS; keystone species; ungulate; water budget",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874878768

Mice remains collected from a Chalcolithic burnt house in southern Romania, provided a unique opportunity to document which of the two house mouse subspecies was the commensal taxa of the late Neolithic Romania and question the factors of its invasive process. To obtain the subspecific status of the Mus remains, we performed molar shape analysis with geometric morphometrics, using 160 specimens sampling the extant Eastern European Mus taxa as modern comparatives. Along with an overwhelming majority of eastern house mice (Mus musculus musculus) living constantly in the Chalcolithic house, indigenous small mammals (common hamster, field mice, voles and white toothed shrews) were also occupying the settlement sporadically, highlighting the antiquity of the synanthropisation of European small mammals. This secured occurrence of the eastern house mouse in late Neolithic Romania, led us to propose two testable research hypotheses: first, an eastern house mouse commensalism center in Eastern Europe happening during the sixth millennium BC, when neolithization reached the natural distribution of free living populations of Mus musculus musculus in the Pontic steppes of Ukraine; second, new trajectories of trading networks, stimulated by copper metallurgy around the fifth millennium BC, having allowed long-distance translocation of the commensal eastern house mouse from Eastern to Southern Europe Neolithic settlements. © SAGE Publications 2011.","commensalism; geometric morphometrics; Neolithic; synanthropisation; teeth; zooarchaeology","archaeology; commensalism; geometry; invasiveness; metallurgy; morphometry; Neolithic; rodent; settlement history; steppe; subspecies; tooth; Romania; Ukraine",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82855163897
