For interpolation of a surface over a fixed set of nodes in the plane, the bending energy is a quadratic form in the heights assigned to the surface. The spline is the superposition of eigenvectors of the bending energy matrix, of successively larger physical scales, over a tilted flat plane having no bending energy at all. When these splines are paired, one representing the x-coordinate of another form and the other the y-coordinate, they aid greatly in the modeling of biological shape change as deformation. In this context, the pair becomes an interpolation map from R2 to R2 relating two sets of landmark points. The spline maps decompose, in the same way as the spline surfaces, into a linear part (an affine transformation) together with the superposition of principal warps, which are geometrically independent, affine-free deformations of progressively smaller geometrical scales. The warps decompose an empirical deformation into orthogonal features more or less as a conventional orthogonal functional analysis decomposes the single scene. This paper demonstrates the decomposition of deformations by principal warps, extends the method to deal with curving edges between landmarks, relates this formalism to other applications of splines current in computer vision, and indicates how they might aid in the extraction of features for analysis, comparison, and diagnosis of biological and medical images. © 1989 IEEE","Affine transformations; biharmonic equation; biomedical image analysis; deformation; principal warps; quadratic variation; shape; thin-plate splines; warping",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957563017

Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

For this reason, studies focusing on purported early hominid hunting and butchery sites are important if rigorous criteria for recognizing such sites are used. Different criteria currently used as evidence of hominid involvement with ancient bones are reviewed and it is concluded that the presence of cutmarks, verified by scanning electron microscope (SEM) inspection, is the most reliable. Successful application of this criterion depends upon a thorough knowledge of the normal variations in microscopic morphology of different types of marks that are found on bones. Therefore, variations in microscopic and gross morphology within and among a large sample of known stone tool cutmarks, carnivore tooth scratches, and rodent gnawing marks are documented. The effects of sedimentary abrasion, as caused by fluvial transport of bones, are also presented. Guidelines are presented for using microscopic criteria to identify unknown marks on fossils and possible applications of this approach are discussed. Further, it is suggested that evidence of hominid carcass-processing activities can be placed into one of three ranked categories of certainty according to the type of data used. Explicitly stating the category and type of evidence used to deduce hominid activities, and by extension to define site types (i.e., butchery, kill, base camp), may improve the clarity of hypotheses about and interpretations of early hominid behaviors. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002170703

The experimental background applied to differentiate both types of marks has been rather limited and authors have sometimes reached conflicting conclusions. This is partly due to methodological reasons: some authors have used very high magnification to examine microscopic features, whereas others have relied on more reduced magnification. Likewise, some experiments have exposed bones to trampling for reduced periods (minutes) whereas others have used longer time periods (hours). The present study stresses that the use of a scanning electronic microscope is not practical for identifying the impact of butchery and trampling marks in complete bone assemblages. It also emphasizes that previous studies have not addressed all the possible variables that could potentially be used to discriminate these marks, nor have they quantified the morphological patterns of each type of mark. Here we present a multivariate analysis of more than a dozen variables and show that butchery and trampling marks have very distinctive microscopic morphology. We advocate the use of a low magnification approach (≤40×), which can enable the analysis of complete assemblages using either hand lenses or binocular lenses. We also show the morphological criteria that differentiate butchery cut marks made with simple and retouched tools. We show that whereas complete discrimination of marks is impossible due to some degree of overlap, the list of criteria derived through multivariate analyses can be confidently used to correctly differentiate butchery and trampling marks in more than 90% of cases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It probably originated in Africa, spreading to Europe and Asia perhaps as early as ∼1million years (Myr) ago. The origin of the Acheulian is thought to have closely coincided with major changes in human brain evolution, allowing for further technological developments. Nonetheless, the emergence of the Acheulian remains unclear because well-dated sites older than 1.4Myr ago are scarce. Here we report on the lithic assemblage and geological context for the Kokiselei 4 archaeological site from the Nachukui formation (West Turkana, Kenya) that bears characteristic early Acheulian tools and pushes the first appearance datum for this stone-age technology back to 1.76Myr ago. Moreover, co-occurrence of Oldowan and Acheulian artefacts at the Kokiselei site complex indicates that the two technologies are not mutually exclusive time-successive components of an evolving cultural lineage, and suggests that the Acheulian was either imported from another location yet to be identified or originated from Oldowan hominins at this vicinity. In either case, the Acheulian did not accompany the first human dispersal from Africa despite being available at the time. This may indicate that multiple groups of hominins distinguished by separate stone-tool-making behaviours and dispersal strategies coexisted in Africa at 1.76Myr ago. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Although stone tool assemblages attributed to the Acheulean have been reported from as early as circa 1.6-1.75 Ma, the characteristics of these earliest occurrences and comparisons with later assemblages have not been reported in detail. Here, we provide a newly established chronometric calibration for the Acheulean assemblages of the Konso Formation, southern Ethiopia, which span the time period ∼1.75 to <1.0 Ma. The earliest Konso Acheulean is chronologically indistinguishable from the assemblage recently published as the world's earliest with an age of ∼1.75 Ma at Kokiselei, west of Lake Turkana, Kenya. This Konso assemblage is characterized by a combination of large picks and crude bifaces/unifaces made predominantly on large flake blanks. An increase in the number of flake scars was observed within the Konso Formation handaxe assemblages through time, but this was less so with picks. The Konso evidence suggests that both picks and handaxes were essential components of the Acheulean from its initial stages and that the two probably differed in function. The temporal refinement seen, especially in the handaxe forms at Konso, implies enhanced function through time, perhaps in processing carcasses with long and stable cutting edges. The documentation of the earliest Acheulean at ∼1.75 Ma in both northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia suggests that behavioral novelties were being established in a regional scale at that time, paralleling the emergence of Homo erectus-like hominid morphology.","Chronostratigraphy; Early pleistocene; Lithic technology development","archeology; article; calibration; carcass; chronology; Ethiopia; general device; handaxe; Kenya; Konso formation; pick; priority journal; Animals; Archaeology; Argon; Chronology as Topic; Ethiopia; Fossils; Hominidae; Isotopes; Radioisotopes; Radiometric Dating; Technology; Time Factors; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873168564

We demonstrate how deformation grids and reconstructed shapes or forms can be used as powerful tools to visualize shape and form differences. Complex patterns of individual or group differences can be studied effectively by ordinations of shape space or form space. Allometry, the statistical relationship between size and shape, is estimated in geometric morphometrics by regression of the Procrustes shape coordinates on centroid size. We illustrate these methods by an application to human face shape. We reveal shape cues to body size in the adult male face, partly resembling ontogenetic allometry.

Here we present a new method that allows a three-dimensional reconstruction of cutmark morphology and the quantification of profile parameters. We have tested this new technique on cutmarks that were experimentally inflicted on a pig rib using a steel knife and an un-retouched flint flake at different angles. The method allows for the cross-sectional shape, the sharpness and depths of the resulting cutmarks to be quantified. The data show that knife mark sections are characterised by a V-shape or √-shape depending on the inclination of the knife. Cutmarks produced with the flint flake were less clearly defined and generally less sharp than those produced by the knife.

Handaxes made with a predetermined form and a high degree of symmetry are the main characteristic of the Acheulian tradition. The tools are shaped through a long knapping sequence with a remarkable increase in the technical skills of the makers, compared with the older Oldowan tradition, implying a high degree of planning and foresight.

Morphological attributes of the cut marks were measured using an Alicona imaging microscope, a novel optical technique that generates three-dimensional virtual reconstructions of surface features. The study shows that high-resolution measurements of cut marks can shed light on aspects of butchery techniques, tool use and the behavioural repertoire of Lower Palaeolithic hominins. Differences between the experimental cut marks and those on the Boxgrove large mammal bones suggest variation in the angle of the cuts and greater forces used in the butchery of the larger (rhinoceros-sized) carcasses at Boxgrove. Tool-edge characteristics may account for some of these differences, but the greater robusticity of the Boxgrove hominins (attributed to Homo heidelbergensis) may be a factor in the greater forces indicated by some of the cut marks on the Boxgrove specimens. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanisms are proposed to explain these observations. Residue materials on the archaeological and experimental tools were found to be composed principally of silicium or calcium, and include grass phytoliths, crystalline materials from wood cells, and fragments of silicified wood cells, as well as bone mineral and other animal tissues. Most of the mineral residues were quite characteristic of the cells from which they came, often replicating parts of cellular structures.

In Africa, large cutting tools (hand-axes and bifacial chopping tools) became part of Palaeolithic technology during the Early Pleistocene (∼1.5 Myr ago). However, in Europe this change had not been documented until the Middle Pleistocene (<0.5 Myr ago). Here we report dates for two western Mediterranean hand-axe sites that are nearly twice the age of the supposed earliest Acheulian in western Europe. Palaeomagnetic analysis of these two sites in southeastern Spain found reverse polarity magnetozones, showing that hand-axes were already in Europe as early as 0.9 Myr ago.

The author conducted experiments to establish the relationship between the edge characteristics of metal and stone tools that create slicing cut-marks and the marks they produce when applied to bone. The type of tool used to produce such cut-marks on bone can be identified by taking silicone moulds of slicing cut-marks and analysing them in a scanning electron microscope. Quantifying the distribution of metal versus stone tool types over time and space provides insight into the processes underlying the introduction and diffusion of a functional metallurgical technology for subsistence activities. Prehistoric data from the central Balkans of southeast Europe are presented to illustrate the utility of the procedure. These data are used to calculate the frequency of use and relative importance of stone and metal implements over time in the central Balkans, from the introduction of metallurgy during the Late Neolithic (c. 3900-3300 BC) through the end of the Bronze Age (c. 1000 BC).","Cut-marks; Experimental archaeology; Metallurgy; Scanning electron microscopy; Zooarchaeology","archaeological evidence; bone; metallurgy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033405768

This study has documented several cut marks on different bones, which indicate bulk flesh and viscerae extraction by Middle Pleistocene hominins. Several arguments are provided to support that at least some of the cut marks were made with handaxes, further suggesting that some of these artifacts were butchering tools in this stage of human evolution. Although cut marks on elephant carcasses have been documented at some Middle Pleistocene sites, very few have been published in detail to allow consideration of their status as hominin-imparted marks.

Certain archaeological situations, especially those dealing with the recovery and analysis of battle casualties, may raise questions about what type(s) of bladed weapon was used in a particular conflict (e.g., the battle of Kamakura, Japan, AD 1333; the battle of Wisby, Sweden, AD 1361; the battle of Towton, England, AD 1461). Little work has been done, however, on developing criteria to differentiate sword cut marks from other types of cut marks, or to distinguish between marks created by different sword types. To develop such criteria, bovine tibiae (n = 7) were struck using six different types of bladed weapon and the resulting marks (n = 92) were analyzed. Eight traits describing the morphology of the cut mark - such as shape, the presence and unilateral/bilateral state of flaking and feathering, the presence of bone shards, associated breaks, etc. - are defined and related to blade type used. Sword marks were found to be easily distinguishable from knife marks. The variation in marks made by different sword types is significantly correlated with differences in blade weight (p < 0.0001), grip (p < 0.0113), and sharpness (p ≤ 0.0179). The criteria and analyses developed and implemented in this study will be of use to researchers in forensics and osteoarchaeology who want to infer bladed weapon type from marks on bones. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It represents the emergence of a complex behavior, expressed in the recurrent manufacture of large-sized tools, with standardized forms, implying more advance forethought and planning by hominins than those required by the precedent Oldowan technology. The earliest known evidence of this technology dates back to c. 1.7 Ma. and is limited to two sites (Kokiselei [Kenya] and Konso [Ethiopia]), both of which lack functionally-associated fauna. The functionality of these earliest Acheulean assemblages remains unknown. Here we present the discovery of another early Acheulean site also dating to c. 1.7 Ma from Olduvai Gorge. This site provides evidence of the earliest steps in developing the Acheulean technology and is the oldest Acheulean site in which stone tools occur spatially and functionally associated with the exploitation of fauna. Simple and elaborate large-cutting tools (LCT) and bifacial handaxes co-exist at FLK West, showing that complex cognition was present from the earliest stages of the Acheulean. Here we provide a detailed technological study and evidence of the use of these tools on the butchery and consumption of fauna, probably by early Homo erectus sensu lato.",,"animal; fossil; geology; human; Tanzania; time factor; tool use; Animals; Fossils; Geology; Humans; Tanzania; Time Factors; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949491348

Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classifications were suggested. This article presents an innovative methodology which supplements the microscopic study of cut marks. Despite the benefits of using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the two-dimensional identification of these marks, it has a number of drawbacks such as the high costs and, consequently, the limited sample studied. In this article, a low-cost technique for the analysis of cut mark micromorphology from a tri-dimensional perspective is introduced. It provides a high-resolution approach to cut mark characterisation such as morphology, depth, width, and angle estimation as well as section determination, measured directly on the marks on bones. Macro-photogrammetry records quantitative and qualitative information which can be statistically processed with standard multivariate and geometric morphometric tools. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer vision; Cut marks; Image-based modelling; Macro-photogrammetry; Taphonomy","archaeological evidence; bone; image analysis; micromorphology; modeling; photogrammetry; taphonomy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939196614

Three types of chipped stone tools (blades, flakes, and side scrapers) and raw materials (flint, obsidian, and quartzite), as well as issues relevant to lithic production and use were examined and tested. Silicone molds of cut marks produced by each of the instruments were made and subjected to analysis in light optical and scanning electron microscopes under various levels of magnification. The criteria used for distinguishing tool type, raw material, type of production and use characteristics of the respective cutting instruments are presented, as well as a discussion of the application of the experimental results to the Early Bronze Age I site of Afridar, Israel.

This microscope captures 3D images of the bone surface, thus bringing into focus the whole section of striations. This enables the direct observation of their shape from several points of view and the relatively rapid procurement of a variety of measurements (e.g. depth, breadth, angles). This technology has been applied to several butchery experiments, in which both stone and metal tools have been used to produce cut marks on skeletal elements. The morphometrical parameters presented in this paper enabled the correct identification of the different origins of experimental striations and were further tested on two archaeological sets of cut marks inflicted by both metal blades and flint flakes or tools. Therefore, the obtained experimental records constitute a useful database for archaeological remains. The morphometrical parameters developed and implemented in this study represent objective criteria for identifying the origin of cut marks which can be processed through statistical analysis. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","3D-images; Cut marks cross-sections; Digital microscope; Morphometrical parameters; Stone vs. metal tools; Taphonomy",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867331436

Some common pitfalls of these methods when used to analyze fossil specimens are: (1) ignoring the possibility that a fossil belongs to a group other than one of the predefined reference samples (i.e., restricted versus unrestricted approaches to classification), (2) misinterpreting probabilities of group membership (i.e., posterior versus typicality probabilities), and (3) failing to understand how sample sizes influence multivariate ordinations in trying to effectively illustrate the morphometric affinities of a fossil (i.e., weighted versus unweighted analyses with fossils entered indirectly or directly into the analysis). To better understand canonincal variate analysis and generalized distances, the workings of these methods are portrayed graphically as a series of rotations and rescaling of data plotted in a multivariate data space. The influence of sample sizes and the importance of higher-numberer canonical variates are emphasized. Simple examples taken from the literature illustrate how the different approaches to including a fosil in canonical variate analysis may affect the multivariate results upon which physical anthropologists base their interpretations of the fossil's morphology. © 1992 International Institute for the Study of Man.","Fossils; Morphometrics; Multivariate Analysis",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-51649138090

However, the nature of interactions between early humans and elephants is still under discussion. Elephant remains are found in Palaeolithic sites, both open-air and cave sites, in Europe, Asia, the Levant, and Africa. In some cases elephant and mammoth remains indicate evidence for butchering and marrow extraction performed by humans. Revadim Quarry (Israel) is a Late Acheulian site where elephant remains were found in association with characteristic Lower Palaeolithic flint tools. In this paper we present results regarding the use of Palaeolithic tools in processing animal carcasses and rare identification of fat residue preserved on Lower Palaeolithic tools. Our results shed new light on the use of Palaeolithic stone tools and provide, for the first time, direct evidence (residue) of animal exploitation through the use of an Acheulian biface and a scraper. The association of an elephant rib bearing cut marks with these tools may reinforce the view suggesting the use of Palaeolithic stone tools in the consumption of large game. © 2015 Solodenko et al.",,"calcium phosphate; fat; analytic method; animal tissue; Article; bone mineral; carcass; elephant; hydrolysis; infrared spectroscopy; Israel; nonhuman; Paleolithic; residue analysis; rib; shoulder; use wear analysis; animal; archeology; carnivory; diet; human; paleontology; Animalia; Elephantidae; Animals; Archaeology; Carnivory; Diet; Elephants; Fats; Humans; Israel; Paleontology",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925438700

This work focuses on a sample of cut-marked bones from the Bell's Korongo (BK) site (Upper Bed II, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania), which is an emblematic early Pleistocene site where a large faunal assemblage, including a diverse megafauna, occurs in association with quartzite and basalt industries. We present a detailed study of a sample of 58 cut marks identified on a set of recently excavated BK fossils, using a micro-photogrammetric and geometric morphometric approach, with the aim of identifying the raw materials used in the butchery of carcasses. In order to carry out this study, we previously carried out an experimental analysis to characterize cut marks and their morphology according to the types of raw material found at BK, namely quartzite and basalt. The results from the experimental study show that there is a good fit between raw material type and cut mark morphology, enabling us to confidently apply this method to the analysis of the cut marks of the BK fossil assemblage. The present study shows that most of the BK cut marks were created by the use of quartzite tools. The efficiency of this type of raw material is emphasized, which explains its curation over the landscape by hominins. © 2017 Collegium Boreas.

However, the method by which we identify and interpret these marks remains largely unchanged despite decades of research, relying on qualitative criteria and lacking standardization between analysts. Recently, zooarchaeologists have begun using new technologies capable of capturing 3-D data from bone surface modifications to advance our knowledge of these informative traces. However, an important step in this research has been overlooked and after years of work, we lack both a universal and replicable protocol and an understanding of the precision of these techniques. Here we propose a new standard for identifying bone surface modifications using high-resolution 3-D data and offer a systematic and replicable approach for researchers to follow. Data were collected with a white-light non-contact confocal profilometer and analyzed with Digital Surf's Mountains® software. Our data show that when methods are standardized, results between researchers are statistically indistinguishable. Multivariate analyses using the measured parameters allow discrimination between stone tool cut marks and mammalian carnivore tooth marks with 97.5% accuracy. Application of this method to fossil specimens resulted in 100% correspondence with identifications made by an experienced analyst using macroscopic observations of qualitative features of bone surface modifications. High-resolution 3-D analyses of bone surface modifications have great potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of taphonomic research, but only if our methods are replicable and precise. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Confocal profilometry; Cut mark; Feeding trace; Tooth mark","archaeological evidence; bone; carnivore; fossil record; hominid; multivariate analysis; quantitative analysis; Stone Age; Mammalia; anatomy and histology; animal; archeology; bone; fossil; hominid; multivariate analysis; procedures; three dimensional imaging; tool use; Animals; Archaeology; Bone and Bones; Fossils; Hominidae; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Multivariate Analysis; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006943933

Here, we apply this analytical technique to the study of carnivore tooth scores. The goal is twofold: on the one hand, we intend to differentiate carnivore types and on the other one, we show the application of this approach to a sample of tooth scores from long bones documented at the modern assemblage of the Olduvai Carnivore Site (OCS). Previous taphonomic work at OCS suggested that this bone assemblage constituted a good evidence of a carcass accumulation behavior by lions, followed by hyena ravaging. The application of these 3D techniques to the selected sample of tooth marks shows that lions, as well as spotted hyenas, did indeed impart marks on the OCS assemblage. This reinforces the dual nature of the assemblage and the implication of lions in its formation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Den; Hyena; Lion; Score; Taphonomy","analytical method; bone; felid; fossil assemblage; geometry; morphology; morphometry; Olduvai event; paleoecology; photogrammetry; taphonomy; tooth; Tanzania; Crocuta crocuta",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013104677

If diagnostic cut mark characteristics can be linked to flake and core tool use or the completion of distinct butchery actions, it may be possible to infer ancient tool preferences, reconstruct the consumption of specific muscular tissues, and illuminate landscape-scale stone resource use. Recently, diagnostic morphological criteria including cut mark width and depth have been used to identify marks made by different classes of experimental and archaeological stone tools (Bello, S.M., Parfitt, S.A., Stringer, C., 2009. Quantitative micromorphological analyses of cut marks produced by ancient and modern handaxes. Journal of Archaeological Science 36: 1869-1880; de Juana, S., Galan, A.B., Dominguez-Rodrigo, M., 2010.

B., Rodriguez, M., 2009. A new protocol to differentiate trampling marks from butchery cut marks. Journal of Archaeological Science 36: 2643-2654). The work presented here adds to this experimental butchery database by using measurements of cut mark cross-section taken from bone surface molds to investigate how stone tool characteristics including flake versus core tool type, edge angle, and tool weight, influence cut mark width and depth, ultimately testing whether cut mark size is a useful indicator of tool identity. Additionally, these experiments investigate the influence of contextual factors, including butchery action, carcass size, and bone density on cut mark size. An experienced butcher used replicated Oldowan flakes and bifacial core tools in experimental trials that isolated skinning, bulk and scrap muscle defleshing, and element disarticulation cut marks on goat and cow skeletons. This sample explores cut mark traces generated under realistic butchery scenarios and suggests the following results: 1) Core and flake tools were equally efficient at completing all butchery tasks in size 1 and 3 bovid carcasses. 2) Samples of cut mark width and depth produced by core and flake tools were similar and cut marks could not be accurately classified to a known tool type. 3) Skinning and disarticulation activities produced significantly wider and deeper marks than defleshing activities. 4) Cut marks on cows tended to be wider and deeper than those on goats. 5) Cut mark width is negatively correlated with bone density when carcass size and bone portion are taken into consideration. These results suggest that a general quantitative model for inferring tool type or edge characteristics from archaeological cut mark size is not warranted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Actualism; Bone density; Butchery action; Cutmarks; ESA tool type; Experimental butchery; Oldowan","archaeological evidence; archaeology; bone; carnivory; database; hominid; morphology; paleoecology; Stone Age; tool use; Animalia; Bovidae; Capra hircus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862125000

This area, together with a number of zones in the Tagus valley, constitutes one of the most important archives for the knowledge of the European Pleistocene. The purpose of this paper is to establish the chronological frame and the technological strategies implemented in manufacturing lithic tools during the Acheulean techno-complex in the middle stretch of the Tagus basin. Use of large flakes for making bifaces is common in the Acheulean assemblages from this area, as well as in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and the south of France. The earliest Acheulean evidence has been dated to between MIS 15 and MIS 13. From MIS 11/MIS 9 on, this techno-complex is widespread in the region, until MIS 6, when the last evidence has been recorded. Handaxes, cleavers on flake and trihedral picks dominate in the châines opératoires of façonnage, which are present in significant percentages. Short châines opératoires of débitage prevail in quartzite, and discoid and polyhedric in flint. Most retouched tools are seldom elaborate. Lithic assemblages with châines opératoires of façonnage exclusively represented by handaxes start to be recorded towards the end of the Middle Pleistocene. These handaxes are more elaborate than previous and the retouched tools are more complex. Among the activities identified in the sites excavated in overbank facies, exploitation of large mammals, particularly proboscideans, is outstanding, as well as the manufacture of lithic tools and the exploitation of primary flint outcrops. The recording of long recurrent settlements on the same location is remarkable. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Acheulean; Iberian Peninsula; Palaeolithic; Pleistocene; Tagus, Jarama and Manzanares rivers","Acheulean; chronology; exploitation; flint; marine isotope stage; settlement history; tool use; Iberian Peninsula; Jarama River; Madrid [Spain]; Manzanares Valley; Spain; Tagus Basin; Tagus Valley; Galium aparine",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952932502

Within an ISPRS Scientific Initiative a team of researchers from USAL, UCLM, FBK and UNIBO have developed an open photogrammetric tool, called GRAPHOS (inteGRAted PHOtogrammetric Suite). GRAPHOS allows to obtain dense and metric 3D point clouds from terrestrial and UAV images. It encloses robust photogrammetric and computer vision algorithms with the following aims: (i) increase automation, allowing to get dense 3D point clouds through a friendly and easy-to-use interface; (ii) increase flexibility, working with any type of images, scenarios and cameras; (iii) improve quality, guaranteeing high accuracy and resolution; (iv) preserve photogrammetric reliability and repeatability. Last but not least, GRAPHOS has also an educational component reinforced with some didactical explanations about algorithms and their performance. The developments were carried out at different levels: GUI realization, image pre-processing, photogrammetric processing with weight parameters, dataset creation and system evaluation. The paper will present in detail the developments of GRAPHOS with all its photogrammetric components and the evaluation analyses based on various image datasets.

The fossil assemblage mainly comprises the remains of one prime adult individual of Mammuthus meridionalis, together with 125 lithic artefacts, among which several refitting groups of chert have been identified. The lithic assemblage from the Pit 1 locality is composed of cobbles, cores, simple and retouched flakes, together with a large, well-fashioned pick of hard-wearing schist. Spatial, zooarchaeological, taphonomic, technical and use-wear analyses confirm that the occupation was devoted to butchery of the mammoth carcass. The activity zone is in a fluvio-deltaic area that incises the terrace T+60 of the lower Francolí river basin, 50m a.s.l. Palaeomagnetic and cosmogenic analyses, as well as microfaunal (Mimomys savini, Victoriamys chalinei) and macrofaunal biostratigraphy (Mammuthus meridionalis), support the timing of the occupation to the late Matuyama chron. These various lines of evidence point to Barranc de la Boella being the oldest Early Acheulean butchering site in Europe. Ongoing excavations at several localities at Barranc de la Boella are yielding new data on the palaeoenvironmental, geochronological and technological framework of these occupations. Finally, the evidence is integrated into current understanding of the subsistence strategies practised by Early Pleistocene hominins. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Barranc de la Boella; Butchery site; European early Acheulean; Late Early Pleistocene; Mammuthus meridionalis","Acheulean; archaeological evidence; artifact; elephant; fossil assemblage; human activity; Catalonia; Francoli River; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]; Mammuthus meridionalis; Mimomys",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955210729

Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classification have been suggested. Different techniques, such as three-dimensional digital microscope (3D DM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) have been recently applied to the study of cut marks. Although the 3D DM and LSCM microscopic techniques are the most commonly used for the 3D identification of cut marks, M-PG has also proved to be very efficient and a low-cost method. M-PG is a noninvasive technique that allows the study of the cortical surface without any previous preparation of the samples, and that generates high-resolution models. Despite the current application of microscopic and micro-photogrammetric techniques to taphonomy, their reliability has never been tested. In this paper, we compare 3D DM, LSCM and M-PG in order to assess their resolution and results. In this study, we analyse 26 experimental cut marks generated with a metal knife. The quantitative and qualitative information registered is analysed by means of standard multivariate statistics and geometric morphometrics to assess the similarities and differences obtained with the different methodologies. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2017 Royal Microscopical Society","Experimental cut marks; laser scanning confocal microscopy; micro-photogrammetry; statistical agreement; three-dimensional digital microscope","analytic method; Article; biometry; bone; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; intermethod comparison; micro photogrammetry; morphometry; nonhuman; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; surface property; three dimensional digital microscopy; analysis of variance; confocal microscopy; devices; image processing; photogrammetry; procedures; reproducibility; standards; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Analysis of Variance; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Microscopy, Confocal; Models, Statistical; Photogrammetry; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018756590

Interpretations of these technologically different tools suggest that their adequacy for butchery is uneven. Although some experimentation has been made in this regard, further research is needed to understand which of these tool types are more efficient for butchery, thus granting adaptive advantages to the hominins who used them. The present experimental work shows that small handaxes provide higher return rates in butchery activities than simple and retouched flakes. Efficiency (measured in time) is significantly positive in handaxes compared to the other tools when defleshing. In contrast, when comparing the three stone tool sets (simple flakes, retouched flakes and handaxes), the return values obtained for disarticulation are very similar. This study also shows that cut marks do not occur randomly and are less stochastic than previously assumed. Defleshing leaves a preferential cluster of cut marks on mid-shafts from long bones and even on these sections, depending on element type, patterns are statistically demonstrable. © 2013 University of Oxford.","Acheulian; Cut marks; Flakes; Handaxes; Oldowan; Retouched flakes",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911806002

The faunal sample analysed here is distributed in different archaeological levels and is associated with a significant lithic accumulation including several large format tools and handaxes. The fauna indicates the proliferation of open environments similar to those found in other Bed II and late Bed I sites. Evidence of anthropogenic activity (e.g. defleshing activities and marrow consumption) has been identified in the form of cut and percussion marks. A photogrammetric and morphometric analysis suggests that these marks were produced with quartzite flakes and not with handaxes. Evidence of interaction with carnivores was also noted; tooth marks were observed on some bones. Such interaction indicates the existence of competition between humans and carnivores for the same ecological niche, and might lead us to reflect on the survival strategies of Lower Pleistocene hominins. © 2017 Collegium Boreas.

Different criteria have been suggested for the description and classification of cut marks. The methods commonly used for the study of cut marks rely on high-cost microscopy techniques with low portability (i.e., inability to work in situ), such as the 3D digital microscope (3D DM) or laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Recently, new algorithmic developments in the field of computer vision and photogrammetry, have achieved very high precision and resolution, offering a portable and low-cost alternative to microscopic techniques. However, the photogrammetric techniques present some disadvantages, such as longer data collection and processing time, and the requirement of some photogrammetric expertise for the calibration of the cameras and the acquisition of precise image orientation. In this paper, we compare two low-cost techniques and their application to cut mark studies: the micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) technique presented, developed, and validated previously, and a methodology based on the use of a structured light scanner (SLS). A total of 47 experimental cut marks, produced using a stainless steel knife, were analyzed. The data registered through virtual reconstruction was analyzed by means of three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (GMM). © 2017 by the authors.","Bones; Cut marks; Low-cost; Micro-photogrammetry; Statistical agreement; Structured light laser scanner","Bone; Costs; Data handling; Digital devices; Laser applications; Scanning; Stainless steel; Cut marks; Geometric morphometrics; Laser scanner; Laser scanning confocal microscopy; Low costs; Photogrammetric technique; Statistical comparisons; Virtual reconstruction; Photogrammetry",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029389739

This spatial and temporal prevalence raises questions about the factors that may have motivated their use as supplements to more simple flake tools. Hence, understanding the comparative functional performance capabilities of flakes and handaxes is essential to understanding factors that may have motivated the repeated production of handaxes during the Pleistocene. Here, we examine this question using a larger scale experimental approach than has previously been undertaken. We statistically assessed the comparative functional efficiencies of basic flake cutting tools and handaxes when undertaking a series of distinct cutting tasks. Furthermore, for the first time, we examined the functional capabilities of flake tools that are of equal size and mass to handaxes. Our results identify that the specific material context in which these tools are used is key to their relative functional efficiencies, with basic flake cutting tools being significantly more efficient than handaxes when undertaking relatively small, precise cutting tasks. Alternatively, we identify that handaxes are significantly more efficient than basic flake cutting tools when tasked with cutting relatively large, resistant portions of material. Thus, we conclude the adoption and widespread production of handaxes by Pleistocene hominins was motivated, at least in part, by requirements to undertake this specific type of task, rather than them being inherently superior to flakes in all cutting tasks. Indeed, interestingly, the comparative functional efficiencies of handaxes and flakes of equal size are far less pronounced than expected, with a number of tasks displaying no significant efficiency differences. Subsequently, we stress that a number of other hypothesized advantages of handaxes may have also been key to their widespread production and use by Pleistocene hominins. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Acheulean; Cutting; Efficiency; Flake tools; Functional performance",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025469629

Thus, metal tool use has been differentiated in contexts with an abundance of lithic tools, or even the use of hand axes has been documented in carcass processing, in contrast with simple unretouched or retouched flakes. As important as this information is, there are still other important aspects to be analysed. Can cut marks produced with different lithic raw material types be differentiated? Can cut marks made with different types of the same raw material type be characterized and differentiated? The objective of this study is to evaluate if cut marks resulting from the use of different flints and different quartzites are distinguishable from each other. In the present work, an experimental analysis of hundreds of cut marks produced by five types of flint and five varieties of quartzite was carried out. Microphotogrammetry and geometric–morphometric techniques were applied to analyse these cut marks. The results show that flint cut marks and quartzite cut marks can be characterized at the assemblage level. Different types of flint produced cut marks that were not significantly different from each other. Cut marks made with Olduvai Gorge quartzite were significantly different from those produced with a set comprising several other types of quartzites. Crystal size, which is larger in Olduvai Gorge quartzites (0.5 mm) than Spanish quartzites (177–250 μm), is discussed as being the main reason for these statistically significant differences. This documented intra-sample and inter-sample variance does not hinder the resolution of the approach to differentiate between these two generic raw material types and opens the door for the application of this method in archaeological contexts. © 2017 University of Oxford","cut marks; flint; micro-morphometry; micro-photogrammetry; quartzite; raw materials","archaeology; flint; lithic fragment; morphometry; photogrammetry; quartzite; tool use",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028314535

Actualistic butchery trials of 16 goat and cow half-carcasses were completed by an experienced butcher with replicated Oldowan tools to investigate how the geometric organisation of cut mark clusters reflects flake versus core tool use and bulk muscle versus scrap defleshing. A cluster of cut marks is defined as a series of adjacent cut mark striations that occur at an anatomical location and are bounded by unmarked cortical surface. Tool type and butchery action were predicted to differentially mark certain long bone portions and influence cluster attributes. Moulds of 613 cut mark clusters were photographed and measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) for cluster area, cut mark count, median cut mark length and standard deviation of cut mark length and angle. Analysis suggests the following results: (i) cluster attributes are correlated;(ii) changes in cluster geometry are related to increasing cut mark count and length but not tool type or defleshed muscle amount; (iii) large clusters occur on large animals; and (iv) long bone midshaft portions are cut-marked during both bulk and scrap muscle defleshing. Analysis of 179 cut mark clusters on long bone shafts of sizes 1–4 mammals from three Okote member assemblages at Koobi Fora, Kenya, shows that archaeological clusters have a similar number of marks when compared with experimental clusters but are significantly smaller, have shorter median marks and include less deviation in mark length and angle. Archaeological clusters corroborate that increasing area is positively correlated with cut mark count, median mark length and standard deviation of mark length and angle. A quantitative inferential model that links cut mark cluster geometry to tool type or the amount of muscle defleshed is not supported by these data. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Studies of these sharp-edged stone tools show that they were most probably used as cutting implements. However, the only substantial evidence of this is the presence of cut marks on the bones of animals found in association with stone tools in ancient deposits. Numerous studies have aimed to quantify the frequency and placement of these marks. At present there is little consensus on the meaning of these marks and how the frequency relates to specific behaviours in the past. Here we investigate the possibility that mechanical properties associated with edges of stone tools as well as the properties of bones themselves may contribute to the overall morphology of these marks and ultimately their placement in the archaeological record. Standardized tests of rock mechanics (Young’s modulus and Vickers hardness) indicate that the hardness of tool edges significantly affects cut-mark morphology. In addition, we show that indentation hardness of bones also impacts the overall morphology of cut marks. Our results show that rock type and bone portions influence the shape and prevalence of cut marks on animal bones. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In Europe, the earliest evidence comes from recent work at the site of Cueva Negra del Estrecho del Río Quípar in south-eastern Spain. Charred and calcined bone and thermally altered chert were recovered from a deep, 0.8-million-year-old sedimentary deposit. A combination of analyses indicated that these had been heated to 400-600°C, compatible with burning. Inspection of the sediment and hydroxyapatite also suggests combustion and degradation of the bone. The results provide new insight into Early Palaeolithic use of fire and its significance for human evolution.

In some cases, classification may reach an accuracy of 100%. No other statistical tool commonly used in taphonomy had been this successful at classification before. However, the heuristics of ML algorithms depend tightly on the objectivity in raw data collection. The use of multivariate approaches in which variables are independently scored by the analyst introduces a subjective bias. In this work, I show that different analysts producing raw data on the same testing data set can lead to widely divergent BSM classifications and interpretations using the same powerful ML algorithms. It is emphasized that until an objective non-biasing method of raw data collection is implemented, BSM classification carried out via statistical tests will remain heuristically limited. As a consequence, the application of these referents to archeological BSM does not guarantee a correct interpretation beyond the analyst expertise. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Algorithm; Bone surface modification; Cut marks; Machine learning; Taphonomy; Trampling marks",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053340004

This debate, commonly known as the hunter-scavenger debate, fostered the emergence of a new research line into the Bone Surface Modifications (BSMs) produced by both taphonomic agents. Throughout the following 20 years, multiple studies concerning the action of carnivores have been developed, with a particular focus on the oldest archaeological sites in East Africa. Recent technological advances applied to taphonomy have provided new insight into carnivore BSMs. A newly developed part of this work relies on Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) studies aimed at discerning carnivore agency through the morphologic characterization of tooth scores and pits. GMM studies have produced promising results, however methodological limitations are still present. This paper presents the first combined application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and GMM to the analysis of carnivore tooth marks, generating classification rates of 100% between carnivore species in some cases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial Intelligence; Bone Surface modifications; Statistics; Taphonomy","algorithm; archaeology; artificial intelligence; bone; carnivore; hominid; machine learning; morphology; morphometry; statistical analysis; taphonomy; tooth; East Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062731527

For many years, differences in bone density according to element and variations in animal size have been considered conditioning factors for many taphonomic processes. While several studies highlight how animal size and density affect fracture patterns and bone preservation rates, variations in cut mark morphology are yet to be confronted against these variables. Here, we assess the effect of these variables and their potential effect on cut mark morphology by comparing a considerable amount of cut marks on different anatomical elements of both suids and bovids. Experimentally produced cut mark samples were then digitally reconstructed using a David Laser scanner that allowed the statistical analysis of each cut mark's shape and form. Geometric morphometric analysis using 2D and 3D landmark models were unable to find substantial differences in cut mark morphologies caused by either element type of carcass size. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","3D reconstruction; Bone density; Cut marks; Geometric morphometrics","anatomy; animal; bone; geometry; morphology; morphometry; reconstruction; three-dimensional modeling; Animalia; Bovidae; Suidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060484871

These encompass varied technological strategies although the morphological results are often similar. Consequently, bifacial technology is diversified in Eurasia and cannot be correlated to “Acheulean-type behaviour” everywhere, or for all time periods. While early lithic assemblages with bifacial technology appeared in Africa as early as 1.8 Ma, this technology is observed in Eurasia from 1.5 Ma for the earliest evidence, and particularly from 1 Ma onwards. Our purpose here is to focus on Eurasian patterns. This presentation will be divided into three parts in order to describe, clarify and compare the bifacial phenomenon regarding its chronological and geographical extension, based on examples of key sites in diverse Eurasian areas. This first paper presents a review of detailed data from western and southern Europe and the Levant. The second focuses on the East, India, south-eastern Asia and eastern Asia (China). The third and final paper is a comparative analysis of Eurasian areas with occurrences of bifacial technology in relation to paleoanthropological remains in order to clarify the diversity of the bifacial technological phenomenon over time and space. Major European and Levantine sites are described in this first paper. For Europe, the bifacial component is divided into two main currents; before and after the major glacial event of MIS 12. Before MIS 12, sites such as la Noira, Notarchirico, Caune de l'Arago, Galeria II, Cagny-la-Garenne I-II or Boxgrove are taken into consideration. After MIS 12, sites are more numerous and have been widely reviewed (for instance Terra Amata, Guado San Nicolas, Cagny l'Epinette, Soucy…). For the Levant, sites such as Ubeidiya, GBY, Nadaouiyeh and El Meirah are presented. Data from the Arabian Peninsula are also taken into account. © 2015 Académie des sciences","Bifacial tools; Europe; Levant; Technology","Acheulean; anthropology; chronology; detection method; geographical region; marine isotope stage; Pleistocene; technological change; Africa; Arabian Peninsula; Arago Cave; Argentina; Asia; Buenos Aires [Argentina]; China; Eurasia; Europe; France; India; Levant; Mediterranean Region; Occitanie; Pyrenees Orientales; San Nicolas",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975148397

It contains undisturbed sediment 5 m deep assigned by magnetostratigraphy to >0.78 Ma (Matuyama magnetochron). Optically stimulated sediment luminescence dating implies ≥0.5 Ma and mammalian biochronology (notably, of Arvicolid rodents) indicates >0.7-<1 Ma. Remains include an ""Acheulian"" limestone ""hand-Axe,"" and small chert, limestone or quartzite artifacts, knapped on site, often by bipolar reduction or repetitive centripetal flaking of small discoidal cores. Secondarily-flaked (""retouched"") artifacts include small irregular chert fragments, resembling chert at an adjacent conglomerate outcrop according to laser-Ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry of 19 lanthanide elements, though some chert may have been obtained from up to 30 km away. Faunal remains and pollen are compatible with mild (plausibly MIS-21), damp, fluvio-lacustrine environments. Evidence of fire in a deep, sealed layer includes thermally-Altered, lustreless and shattered chert, and both charred and white calcined fragments of bone. Taphonomical analysis and electron microscopy of bone fragments attribute discolouration to burning, not to post-depositional mineral staining. Sediment geochemistry and thin-section micromorphology have been undertaken. FTIRS, TL and ESR analysis of chert and bone imply firing temperatures of about 500C at least.

Since 1990, systematic excavation has revealed an intriguing assemblage of lithic and faunal remains, and hominin teeth. It was deposited 0.99-0.78Ma according to palaeomagnetic and biostratigraphical data; pollen data indicate warm moist conditions. Recently, possible evidence of thermal alteration was detected in a deep part of the deposit. We report here on our revision of the Cueva Negra stratigraphy, and offer information on site formation processes, based on new field observations and preliminary data from soil micromorphology. The Cueva Negra succession comprises three main stratigraphical complexes. Complex 1 is late Holocene. Complexes 2 and 3 are Pleistocene and are formed mainly of alluvial sediment, with subordinate inputs from the cave walls. Complexes 2 and 3 were accumulated almost without interruption, being separated by an erosive surface truncating a thin alluvial soil developed at the top of Complex 3. Our initial micromorphological findings indicate that anthropic inputs are mostly in derived positions, very likely having undergone inward displacement from the mouth of the rock-shelter. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Alluvial sediment; Early Pleistocene; Geoarchaeology; Rock-shelter","Alluvial sediments; Early pleistocene; Field observations; Geo archaeologies; Information-on site; Pleistocene deposits; Rock-shelter; Thermal alteration; Geomagnetism; Stratigraphy; Deposits; alluvial deposit; anthropogenic effect; archaeology; cave; depositional environment; displacement; excavation; faunistics; Holocene; lithic fragment; micromorphology; paleomagnetism; Pleistocene; stratigraphy; tooth; Cueva Negra del Estrecho del Rio Quipar; Murcia [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886247737

We have investigated several possible sources of the chert in an attempt to throw light on Palaeolithic interaction with the environment. Possible sources on the landscape were sampled at distances of up to 30 km from the site. Trace-element fingerprints were analyzed by laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS). Factor analysis was used to differentiate between sources and as a pointer to where chert analyzed from the cave may have been obtained. Our initial assumption was that most had come from less than 1 km away, namely, from a conglomerate outcrop where chert nodules could be quarried readily. Whilst trace-element evidence supports that hypothesis, it also points to a fair likelihood that some recovered chert lithics had been brought from sources up to 30 km away from the cave. Although evidence is scarce for transport of stone from a similar distance at other late Early Pleistocene sites in Europe, it nevertheless is present in the archaeological record, particularly in Spain where it may be possible to begin to consider differences in stone-procurement strategies between late Early Pleistocene technological assemblages.","Chert; Factor analysis; ICP-MS; Late Early Pleistocene; Procurement",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886252560

Bifaces from Terra Amata (MIS 11-10, Nice) and bifaces from AU 27 of Lazaret Cave (MIS 6, Nice) are analyzed in order to determine how they were used. The technological and morphological characteristics of bifaces are linked to create groups with equivalent functional potential. This analysis is completed by a low-power use-wear analysis of the artefacts in order to determine how these tools were used through comparisons with experimental data. Functional data were obtained on two bifaces with distal bevels from Terra Amata and on two bifaces with distal bevels and two bifaces with active edge-points from AU 27. Use-wear on the distal bevels was interpreted as the result of handheld percussion activities. For the edge-points of the pieces from AU 27, use-wear was linked to a linear longitudinal tool motion. Technological, morphological and functional data from bifaces from both sites are compared here to assess the evolution of the functional status of this artefact during the Middle Pleistocene.

Explicit consideration of the principal components from the first stage, formalized in the content of shrunken estimators, leads to a number of practical advantages. In morphometric studies, the first eigenvector is often a size vector, with the remaining vectors contrast or shape-type vectors, so that a decomposition of the canonical variates into size and shape components can be achieved. In applied studies, often a small number of the principal components effect most of the separation between groups; plots of group means and associated concentration ellipses (ideally these should be circular) for important principal components facilitate graphical inspection. Of considerable practical importance is the potential for improved stability of the estimated canonical vectors. When the between-groups sum of squares for a particular principal component is small, and the corresponding eigenvalue of the within-groups correlation matrix is also small, marked instability of the canonical vectors can be expected. The introduction of shrunken estimators, by adding shrinkage constants to the eigenvalues, leads to more stable coefficients. © 1979, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
