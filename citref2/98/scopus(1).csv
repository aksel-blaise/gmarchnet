The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.",,"animal; article; biological model; biometry; evolution; frog; genetics; phylogeny; Animals; Biometry; Evolution; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Ranidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023375195

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption. We consider the implications of these findings in terms of the potential for these approaches in the study of comparative growth in related species.","Facial remodelling; Geometric morphometrics; Thin plate spline analysis","age; allometry; article; cercocebus; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; face growth; female; geometry; male; molar tooth; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; sex difference; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Anthropometry; Bone Remodeling; Cercocebus; Facial Bones; Female; Male; Models, Anatomic; Sex Characteristics; Cercocebus; Cercocebus torquatus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031724058

Box 28147, San Antonio, TX 78284, United States","A major goal in anthropological genetics is the assessment of the effects of different microevolutionary forces. Harpending and Ward (1982) developed a model that aids in this effort by comparing observed and expected heterozygosity within populations in a local region. The expected heterozygosity within a population is a function of the total heterozygosity of the entire region and the distance of the population from the regional mean centroid of allele frequencies. Greater than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having greater heterozygosity than expected. Less than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having less heterozygosity than expected. We extend the Harpending-Ward model to quantitative traits using an equal and additive effects model of inheritance. Here the additive genetic variance within a population is directly proportional to heterozygosity, and its expectation is directly proportional to the genetic distance from the centroid. Under certain assumptions the expectations for phenotypic variances are similar. Observed and expected genetic or phenotypic variance can then be compared to assess the effects of differential external gene flow. When the additive genetic covariance matrix or heritabilities are not known, the phenotypic covariance matrix can be used to provide a conservative application of the model. In addition, we develop new methods for estimation of the genetic relationship matrix (R) from quantitative traits. We apply these models to two data sets: (1) six principal components derived from twenty dermatoglyphic ridge count measures for nine villages in Nepal and (2) ten anthropometric measurements for seven isolated populations in western Ireland. In both cases both the univariate and multivariate analyses provide results that can be directly interpreted in terms of historically known patterns of gene flow.",,"anthropometry; conference paper; heterozygosity; human; india; ireland; mathematical model; population research; quantitative assay; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Dermatoglyphics; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Human; Models, Genetic; Nepal; Northern Ireland; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Variation (Genetics)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025144359

Here we use new methodology based on geometric morphometrics to test the hypothesis that the mandible consists of two main modules, the alveolar region and the ascending ramus, and that this modularity is reflected in the effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL). The shape of each mandible was analyzed by the positions of 16 morphological landmarks and these data were analyzed using Procrustes analysis. Interval mapping in the F2 generation from intercrosses of the LG/J and SM/J strains revealed 33 QTL affecting mandible shape. The QTL effects corresponded to a variety of shape changes, but ordination or a parametric bootstrap test of clustering did not reveal any distinct groups of QTL that would affect primarily one module or the other. The correlations of landmark positions between the two modules tended to be lower than the correlations between arbitrary subsets of landmarks, indicating that the modules were relatively independent of each other and confirming the hypothesized location of the boundary between them. While these results are in agreement with the hypothesis of modularity, they also underscore that modularity is a question of the relative degrees to which QTL contribute to different traits, rather than a question of discrete sets of QTL contributing to discrete sets of traits.",,"animal tissue; article; cluster analysis; correlation analysis; gene mapping; genetic variability; geometry; mandible; morphometrics; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; strain difference; structure analysis; Animals; Biometry; Body Weights and Measures; Crosses, Genetic; Mandible; Mice; Models, Biological; Quantitative Trait Loci; Animalia; Procrustes; Rodentia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-2442588743

However, molecular studies have consistently found the mangabeys to be diphyletic, with Cercocebus and Mandrillus forming a clade to the exclusion of all other papionins. Recent studies have identified cranial and postcranial features which distinguish the Cercocebus-Mandrillus clade, however the detailed similarities in cranial shape between the mangabey genera are more difficult to reconcile with the molecular evidence. Given the large size differential between members of the papionin molecular clades, it has frequently been suggested that allometric effects account for homoplasy in papionin cranial form. A combination of geometric morphometric, bivariate, and multivariate methods was used to evaluate the hypothesis that allometric scaling contributes to craniofacial similarities between like-sized papionin taxa. Patterns of allometric and size-independent cranial shape variation were subsequently described and related to known papionin phylogenetic relationships and patterns of development. Results confirm that allometric scaling of craniofacial shape characterized by positive facial allometry and negative neurocranial allometry is present across adult papionins. Pairwise comparisons of regression lines among genera revealed considerable homogeneity of scaling within the Papionini, however statistically significant differences in regression lines also were noted. In particular, Cercocebus and Lophocebus exhibit a shared slope and significant vertical displacement of their allometric lines relative to other papionins. These findings give no support to narrowly construed hypotheses of uniquely shared patterns of allometric scaling, either between sister taxa or across all papionins. However, more general allometric trends do appear to account for a substantial proportion of papionin cranial shape variation, most notably in those features which have influenced traditional morphological phylogenies. Examination of size-uncorrelated shape variation gives no clear support to molecular phylogenies, but underscores the absence of morphometric similarities between the mangabey genera when size effects are controlled. Patterns of allometric and size-uncorrelated shape variation indicate conservatism of cranial form in non-Theropithecus papionins, and suggest that Papio represents the primitive morphometric pattern for the African papionins. Lophocebus exhibits a divergent morphometric pattern, clearly distinguishable from other papionins, most notably Cercocebus. These results clarify patterns of cranial shape variation among the extant Papionini and lay the groundwork for studies of related fossil taxa. © 2002 Elsevier Sciences Ltd.","Allometry; Cranial homoplasy; Geometric morphometrics; Mangabey diphyly; Papionini","cranium; evolution; primate; shape; Cercocebus; Cercopithecidae; Cercopithecinae; Cercopithecus; Lophocebus; Mandrillus; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Papionini; Primates; Primates; Theropithecus; animal; article; cephalometry; evolution; genetic variability; histology; Macaca; papio; phylogeny; regression analysis; skull; Theropithecus; Animals; Cephalometry; Evolution; Macaca; Papio; Phylogeny; Regression Analysis; Skull; Theropithecus; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035998891

This paper presents a simple, geometric, largely intuitive introduction to the use of multivariate analysis for the study of biological form. Rather than presenting rigorous mathematical formulations of the theory and practice of statistics, the emphasis is on multivariate analysis as a descriptive, data-analytic approach which represents the quantitative version of classical comparative anatomy. One method-canonical variate analysis-is chosen for special attention because of its wide applicability to problems in which multidimensional data are used to compare differences between two, several, or many populations with proper regard for individual variation within the populations. The theory, practice, and utility of canonical variate analysis are presented by way of simple, bivariate examples.

The Amphilophus citrinellus species complex from lakes of Nicaragua has been studied extensively as an example of trophic and colour polymorphism and possible sympatric speciation. We use the methods of geometric morphometrics to investigate variation in body shape in this species complex. There is significant shape variation between the widespread A. citrinellus and the more locally distributed A. labiatus and A. zaliosus, which shows patterns that are consistent with the taxonomic descriptions of those taxa. Contrary to the expectations from models of adaptive character divergence, the shape differences between species in analyses restricted to populations occurring syntopically are smaller than the corresponding differences computed from samples pooled over all locations. Within A. citrinellus, there is considerable variation among lakes as well as between the alternative colour and trophic morphs, suggesting local differentiation based on genetic and ecophenotypic mechanisms. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.","Canonical variate analysis; Landmarks; Pharyngeal jaws; Phenotypic plasticity; Procrustes method; Size; Thin plate spline","body shape; cichlid; morphometry; polymorphism; speciation (biology); Central America; Nicaragua; Amphilophus citrinellus; Amphilophus labiatus; Cichlidae; Pisces; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344152357

A different origin for Palaeoamericans and Amerindians is invoked to explain such a phenomenon. Under this hypothesis, the origin of Palaeoamericans must be traced back to a common ancestor for Palaeoamericans and Australians, which departed from somewhere in southern Asia and arrived in the Australian continent and the Americas around 40,000 and 12,000 years before present, respectively. Most modern Amerindians are believed to be part of a second, morphologically differentiated migration. Here we present evidence of a modern Amerindian group from the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico, showing clearer affinities with Palaeoamerican remains than with modern Amerindians.

In this paper time series and matrix comparison methods are used to examine temporal serial correlation and trend of biological characteristics within a skeletal sample. These methods follow appropriately upon the assumption that the processes of genetic drift and migration lead to temporal autocorrelation of the mean genotype within individual genetic lineages. In the current analysis, using skeletal material from the Pete Klunk Mound Group, temporal serial correlation is demonstrated between samples from different mounds. This indicates that a previous provisional archaeological ordering of the mounds is probably correct. Absence of temporal trend for any of the nonmetric traits examined here suggests a lack of directional evolutionary forces operating on these traits.

Admixture has long been studied after molecular data. Nevertheless, few efforts have been made to explain the morphological outcome in human craniofacial samples. The Spanish-Amerindian contact can be considered a good scenario for such an analysis. Here we present a comparative analysis of craniofacial shape changes observed between two putative ancestor groups, Spanish and precontact Aztecs, and two diachronic admixed groups, corresponding to early and late colonial periods from the Mexico's Central Valley. Quantitative shape comparisons of Amerindian, Spanish, and admixed groups were used to test the expectations of quantitative genetics for admixture events. In its simplest form, this prediction states that an admixed group will present phenotypic values falling between those of both parental groups. Results show that, in general terms, although the human skull is a complex, integrated structure, the craniofacial morphology observed fits the theoretical expectations of quantitative genetics. Thus, it is predictive of population structure and history. In fact, results obtained after the craniofacial analysis are in accordance with previous molecular and historical interpretations, providing evidence that admixture is a main microevolutionary agent influencing modern Mexican gene pool. However, expectations are not straightforward when moderate shape changes are considered. Deviations detected at localized structures, such as the upper and lower face, highlight the evolution of a craniofacial pattern exclusively inherent to the admixed groups, indicating that quantitative characters might respond to admixture in a complicated, nondirectional way. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Craniofacial shape; EDMA; Gene flow; Morphological integration; TPS","archeology; article; comparative study; craniofacial morphology; demography; evolution; gene flow; gene pool; geometry; history; human; human tissue; Mexico; morphological trait; morphometrics; population structure; quantitative genetics; skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33144460385

The city of Teotihuacan was one of the largest and most sophisticated human conglomerates of the pre-industrial world. The Mayan civilization in southeastern Mexico and the Yucatan peninsula reached an impressive degree of development at the same time. This time of prosperity came to an end during the Terminal Classic Period (AD 750-950) a time of massive population loss throughout Mesoamerica. A second episode of massive depopulation in the same area was experienced during the sixteenth century when, in less than one century, between 80% and 90% of the entire indigenous population was lost. The 16th century depopulation of Mexico constitutes one of the worst demographic catastrophes in human history. Although newly imported European and African diseases caused high mortality among the native population, the major 16th century population losses were caused by a series of epidemics of a hemorrhagic fever called Cocoliztli, a highly lethal disease unknown to both Aztec and European physicians during the colonial era. The cocoliztli epidemics occurred during the 16th century megadrought, when severe drought extended at times from central Mexico to the boreal forest of Canada, and from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast. The collapse of the cultures of the Classic Period seems also to have occurred during a time of severe drought. Tree ring and lake sediment records indicate that some of the most severe and prolonged droughts to impact North America-Mesoamerica in the past 1000-4000 years occurred between AD 650 and 1000, particularly during the 8th and 9th centuries, a period of time that coincides with the Terminal Classic Period. Based on the similarities of the climatic (severe drought) and demographic (massive population loss) events in Mesoamerica during the sixteenth century, we propose that drought-associated epidemics of hemorrhagic fever may have contributed to the massive population loss during the Terminal Classic Period. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work was to test several hypotheses about population structure and history of Fueguian-Patagonians to propose a model that incorporates predictions for future studies. R matrix methods and matrix permutation analyses were performed upon a data matrix of craniofacial measurements of 441 skulls divided into nine samples pertaining to six Patagonian and three Fueguian populations. Association of biological distances with three matrices representing several settlement patterns was tested using matrix permutation tests. Results of R matrix study show that the minimum genetic distance obtained confirms separation between Fueguians and Patagonians. Moreover, an analysis of residual variances from the expected regression line confirms admixture between Andean and Pampean populations and Araucanian groups, consistent with ethnohistorical observations. A model representing a long history of isolation between Fueguian and Patagonians, rather than a model emphasizing differences in life-strategies, presented the best correlation with the biological distance matrix. Because similar results were already obtained in archaeological, molecular, and morphological studies, a model for the settlement of Tierra del Fuego is proposed. It is summarized by four main hypotheses that can be tested independently by different disciplines in the future. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"analysis of variance; archeology; Argentina; article; cephalometry; cluster analysis; controlled study; ethnology; genetic analysis; genetic distance; history; human; major clinical study; molecular biology; morphological trait; mutational analysis; population genetics; population structure; priority journal; regression analysis; Anthropology, Cultural; Anthropology, Physical; Argentina; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Humans",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036254687

Estimates of FST based on odontometric data indicate limited heterogeneity for the Apalachee samples, suggestive of some degree of within-group endogamy for this ethnic group prior to contact. This corresponds well with ethnohistoric reconstructions indicating that Apalachee were populous, partially linguistically isolated from its neighbors, and involved in persistent cycles of warfare with neighboring groups. Estimates of extralocal gene flow for the Apalachee samples indicate limited initial changes in the mating structure of these populations. After 1650, however, extralocal gene flow increases, consistent with evidence for dramatic population movements throughout northern Florida and increased Spanish presence in the province, particularly at the mission of San Luis. Inclusion of non-Apalachee outgroups does not increase estimates of genetic heterogeneity, as was expected based on ethnohistoric data. The pattern of genetic distances suggests a biological division between north and south Florida population groups, consistent with archaeological and ethnohistoric data, and similarly indicates some distinction between precontact and postcontact local groups. Differential extralocal gene flow experienced by pre-1650 Apalachee and Timucua populations suggests localized mission experience. The Apalachee, with large, dense populations, experienced limited initial changes in genetic diversity or mating structure. However, after 1650 they were apparently involved in a much more expansive mating network that may have included Spaniards and immigrant Native American groups to the region. These results are in contrast to the mission experience of the Guale Indians of the Georgia coast. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Dental microevolution; European contact; La Florida missions; R matrix","American Indian; ethnic group; gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic variability; human; mating; population genetics; review; Florida; History, 17th Century; Humans; Indians, North American; Missions and Missionaries; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Spain; Variation (Genetics)",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-26044460818

When 24 craniofacial measurements of a series of human populations are used to generate neighbor-joining dendrograms, it is no surprise that all modern European groups, ranging all of the way from Scandinavia to eastern Europe and throughout the Mediterranean to the Middle East, show that they are closely related to each other. The surprise is that the Neolithic peoples of Europe and their Bronze Age successors are not closely related to the modern inhabitants, although the prehistoric/modern ties are somewhat more apparent in southern Europe. It is a further surprise that the Epipalaeolithic Natufian of Israel from whom the Neolithic realm was assumed to arise has a clear link to Sub-Saharan Africa. Basques and Canary Islanders are clearly associated with modern Europeans. When canonical variates are plotted, neither sample ties in with Cro-Magnon as was once suggested. The data treated here support the idea that the Neolithic moved out of the Near East into the circum-Mediterranean areas and Europe by a process of demic diffusion but that subsequently the in situ residents of those areas, derived from the Late Pleistocene inhabitants, absorbed both the agricultural life way and the people who had brought it. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Basque and canary islands placement; Craniometries; Cro-magnon reassessment; Neolithic versus modern form; Prehistoric versus modern european form","anthropology; article; craniofacial development; craniofacial morphology; Europe; face; human; neighbor joining method; priority journal; probability; race; skeleton; Anthropometry; Cluster Analysis; Demography; Europe; European Continental Ancestry Group; Facial Bones; Fossils; History, Ancient; Humans; Phylogeny; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-30444455438
