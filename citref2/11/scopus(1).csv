We identified cutmarks by elimination of other likely causes of the marks on the bone surfaces, for example, gnawing or chewing by carnivores or rodents, and damage made by tools of excavators or preparators. This was achieved by comparing the marks on the fossils with those produced by known causes on modern bones, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Because the fossils occur as part of accumulations of animal remains in relatively undisturbed geological contexts, we conclude that there is a functional association between the stone artefacts and bones at these sites, rather than an accidental, postmortem association1,2. © 1981 Nature Publishing Group.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001004708

As such, they hold some of the oldest available information on cognitive ability and behaviour in human evolution. Here we present a new method that allows a three-dimensional reconstruction of cutmark morphology and the quantification of profile parameters. We have tested this new technique on cutmarks that were experimentally inflicted on a pig rib using a steel knife and an un-retouched flint flake at different angles. The method allows for the cross-sectional shape, the sharpness and depths of the resulting cutmarks to be quantified. The data show that knife mark sections are characterised by a V-shape or √-shape depending on the inclination of the knife. Cutmarks produced with the flint flake were less clearly defined and generally less sharp than those produced by the knife. We discuss the method's potential to provide new information on butchery technique and cognitive abilities developed by the human lineage, from the earliest tool-using hominins through to modern Homo sapiens. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Morphological attributes of the cut marks were measured using an Alicona imaging microscope, a novel optical technique that generates three-dimensional virtual reconstructions of surface features. The study shows that high-resolution measurements of cut marks can shed light on aspects of butchery techniques, tool use and the behavioural repertoire of Lower Palaeolithic hominins. Differences between the experimental cut marks and those on the Boxgrove large mammal bones suggest variation in the angle of the cuts and greater forces used in the butchery of the larger (rhinoceros-sized) carcasses at Boxgrove. Tool-edge characteristics may account for some of these differences, but the greater robusticity of the Boxgrove hominins (attributed to Homo heidelbergensis) may be a factor in the greater forces indicated by some of the cut marks on the Boxgrove specimens. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Taphonomic and experimental approaches have been systematically applied in an effort to understand the technical and artistic procedures followed. In this study, we applied a new combination of 3-dimensional microscopy (focus variation optical microscope) and micro-CT scanning to the analysis of two Magdalenian engraved specimens: a reindeer antler from the site of Neschers (France), engraved with the partial image of a horse in left profile, and a horse metatarsal from Courbet Cave, Penne (France), engraved with a horse head also in left profile. Results of the analysis suggest that both the Neschers and Courbet Cave engravings had been prepared before being carved. The overall contours of the horse body/head were incised first, while anatomical features were added afterwards. In the Neschers case, the incision resulted from the repeated scratching of a previously made incision in order to enlarge the engraving, possibly reflecting the engraver's aesthetic sense. The combination of the techniques used in this study is applicable to fragile or unique archaeological specimens. Micro-CT scanning, in particular, provides non-invasive means for identifying engravings that are obscured by encrusted sediment. The application of these techniques can potentially open new avenues for the authentication, technical and gestural recognition and interpretation of incised forms and artistic creativity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Courbet Cave; Engraving; Focus variation microscopy; Magdalenian portable art; Micro-CT; Neschers","archaeological evidence; art; bone; Paleolithic; taphonomy; France; Animalia; Equidae; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874404546

This work focuses on a sample of cut-marked bones from the Bell's Korongo (BK) site (Upper Bed II, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania), which is an emblematic early Pleistocene site where a large faunal assemblage, including a diverse megafauna, occurs in association with quartzite and basalt industries. We present a detailed study of a sample of 58 cut marks identified on a set of recently excavated BK fossils, using a micro-photogrammetric and geometric morphometric approach, with the aim of identifying the raw materials used in the butchery of carcasses. In order to carry out this study, we previously carried out an experimental analysis to characterize cut marks and their morphology according to the types of raw material found at BK, namely quartzite and basalt. The results from the experimental study show that there is a good fit between raw material type and cut mark morphology, enabling us to confidently apply this method to the analysis of the cut marks of the BK fossil assemblage. The present study shows that most of the BK cut marks were created by the use of quartzite tools. The efficiency of this type of raw material is emphasized, which explains its curation over the landscape by hominins. © 2017 Collegium Boreas.

Micromorphological analyses of cut-marks have been shown to further the interpretation of hominin behavioural patterns. However, to date, the microscopic investigation of cut-marks has been limited to two-dimensional analyses or to the qualitative assessment of three-dimensional (3D) morphology. A new technology using the Alicona 3D InfiniteFocus imaging microscope reported here surpasses any current observational or microscopic method for the analysis of cut-marks. By creating a series of image planes and overlapping focus levels to construct a 3D composite image, vertical variations in the surface structure can be used to interpret differences in the mechanical impact caused by different types of tool and different butchery techniques. Three case studies are presented. The first describes cut-marks observed on the human anterior teeth from the Middle Pleistocene site of Boxgrove (West Sussex, England) which are interpreted as indications of two possible types of human behaviour: the use of the mouth as a third hand and postmortem treatment of the body. The second case study, an analysis of cut-marks on human remains at the Later Upper Palaeolithic (Magdalenian) site of Gough's Cave (Somerset, England), questions the interpretation of cannibalism previously accepted for this site by suggesting the hypothesis of burial ritual involving the butchering, but not the consumption, of human bodies.

One of them is related to the action of carnivores, which is reflected in conspicuous tooth marks, such as pits, scores, punctures or furrowing. Different carnivores damage bone assemblages differently. Thus, several researches have tried to identify carnivore agency based on different parameters such as skeletal profiles, tooth mark frequencies and dimensions, breakage patterns, or more recently, taphotypes. Here we propose a new methodology based on the analysis of tooth scores to determine the carnivore type involved in bone modification. For this purpose, we have built 3D models of several tooth scores produced by wolves, lions, jaguars, foxes and hyenas using photogrammetric techniques. These models were later analyzed by means of Geometric Morphometrics and multivariate statistics. We show that although there is a high degree of overlap in tooth mark morphology, the combined action of tooth score dimensions and morphology enables the identification of some of the tooth scores made by lions from those of the other carnivores with a higher degree of confidence than any other inter-carnivore comparison. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer vision; Image-based modelling; Micro-Photogrammetry; Scores; Taphonomy of carnivores; Tooth marks",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019725876

The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks– 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores–were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished. © 2018 Yravedra et al.

The faunal sample analysed here is distributed in different archaeological levels and is associated with a significant lithic accumulation including several large format tools and handaxes. The fauna indicates the proliferation of open environments similar to those found in other Bed II and late Bed I sites. Evidence of anthropogenic activity (e.g. defleshing activities and marrow consumption) has been identified in the form of cut and percussion marks. A photogrammetric and morphometric analysis suggests that these marks were produced with quartzite flakes and not with handaxes. Evidence of interaction with carnivores was also noted; tooth marks were observed on some bones. Such interaction indicates the existence of competition between humans and carnivores for the same ecological niche, and might lead us to reflect on the survival strategies of Lower Pleistocene hominins. © 2017 Collegium Boreas.

While a certain optimism is present, some important questions are ignored and others overemphasized without appropriate empirical support. This specifically affects the study of cut marks.

Nevertheless, this broader range of methodological approaches also presents some problems. The capacity of laser scanners in processing inconspicuous and superficial cortical alterations, such as trampling marks, has proven to be problematic. This study presents a new advance towards resolving this problem through the use of the HIROX KH-8700 Digital Microscope, whereby detailed digital three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions are able to pick up such minute BSMs. Through the statistical comparison of the David Laser scanner and the HIROX KH-8700 Digital Microscope, this paper contributes to our understanding of said equipment, followed by a significant advance in the characterisation of superficial BSMs. The combination of advanced microscopy and the application of geometric morphometrics highlights a morphological differentiation between two different types of trampling marks, hereby named scratch and graze trampling marks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Bone surface modifications (BSM); Geometric morphometrics; Microscopy; Taphonomy","archaeology; error analysis; geometry; microscopy; morphometry; taphonomy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058956060

This debate, commonly known as the hunter-scavenger debate, fostered the emergence of a new research line into the Bone Surface Modifications (BSMs) produced by both taphonomic agents. Throughout the following 20 years, multiple studies concerning the action of carnivores have been developed, with a particular focus on the oldest archaeological sites in East Africa. Recent technological advances applied to taphonomy have provided new insight into carnivore BSMs. A newly developed part of this work relies on Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) studies aimed at discerning carnivore agency through the morphologic characterization of tooth scores and pits. GMM studies have produced promising results, however methodological limitations are still present.

Here, we assess the effect of these variables and their potential effect on cut mark morphology by comparing a considerable amount of cut marks on different anatomical elements of both suids and bovids.

Discerning carnivore involvement in the archaeo-paleontological record during the Plio-Pleistocene is especially important due to the capability of several carnivores of creating bone assemblages, to the interaction with other species in the modification of bones across the landscape and to the potential interspecific competition (e.g., with other carnivores or hominins). Several variables have been explored to discern the carnivore taxa involved in bone modification, but most of them led to equifinality. Recently, the application of computer vision and geometric morphometric techniques for the reconstruction of tooth mark morphology has provided satisfactory results in terms of differentiating among carnivore taxa with similar body size. Here we apply this new technique to the study of pits from the Olduvai Carnivore site (OCS), which has been interpreted as the first bone assemblage generated by lions and subsequently ravaged by hyenas. Results support the lions' involvement and post-ravaging action of hyenas in the OCS assemblage. Lastly, we also explore the potential of applying these new techniques to other bone assemblages in which different carnivore taxa were involved in their modification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","FLK Zinj; Geometric morphometry; Hyena; Lion; Pits; Structured light scanner","archaeological evidence; felid; morphometry; paleontology; taphonomy; tooth; Felidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057827524

This most crucial part of taphonomic analysis of the archaeological human record has been controversial due to highly subjective interpretations of BSM. Here, we use a sample of 79 trampling and cut marks to compare the accuracy in mark identification on bones by human experts and computer trained algorithms. We demonstrate that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and support vector machines (SVM) can recognize marks with accuracy that far exceeds that of human experts. Automated recognition and analysis of BSM using DCNN can achieve an accuracy of 91% of correct identification of cut and trampling marks versus a much lower accuracy rate (63%) obtained by trained human experts. This success underscores the capability of machine learning algorithms to help resolve controversies in taphonomic research and, more specifically, in the study of bone surface modifications.

This phenomenon was defined by Lyman (1987) as a problem of equifinality, with which the researcher warned about the risks of making direct systematic correlations. The fact that a specific type of damage cannot be linked to a single actor, behaviour or ecological context is primarily applicable to damage associated with the direct consumption of carcasses. Some carnivores show physical and dental characteristics that could lead to bone modifications potentially like those generated by humans. For example, bears have a bunodont dentition and plantigrade locomotion –the latter allows them to frequently release and use their claws as “hands”. Here, we present the neo-taphonomical study of 17 ungulate carcasses eaten by wild brown bears (Ursus arctos arctos) in the Spanish Pyrenees. Our observations express this equifinal problem due to the similarities between tooth marks and peeling generated by both bears and humans. This fact is especially significant, given that peeling and the combination of this damage with visible tooth marks were primarily associated with the feeding activities of humans and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and only anecdotally with other taphonomic agents, such as spotted hyenas. With this research, we try to show some equifinal phenomena that could occur in Pleistocene faunal assemblages as well, where the presence of both hominids and bears is documented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Bears; Equifinality; Humans; Neo-taphonomy; Pleistocene","archaeology; bear; bone; carnivore; dentition; locomotion; Pleistocene; taphonomy; ungulate; Pyrenees; Crocuta crocuta; Hominidae; Pan; Pan troglodytes; Ungulata; Ursus arctos; Ursus arctos arctos",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065797572

These traces are direct indications of human activity and by studying how and why they were made, we can begin to understand a variety of past human behaviours. Consequently, over the last ten years we have observed an increase in the development of new analytical techniques to better understand the production, function, macro-, and micro-morphometric characteristics of bone modifications. In this study we present the application of multiple techniques to visualise and analyse the internal and external features of modified bone, teeth and antler. A Focus Variation Microscope (FVM), the Alicona InfiniteFocus optical surface measurement system, was used to examine the topography of surface modifications. This system produces 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, allowing evaluations of metric parameters (depth, width, area and volume) associated with different type of modifications. A Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), operated in variable pressure mode, was used to capture higher resolution images for better characterisation and identification of the modifications and finer details, which are not always visible using a FVM. The extension of an SEM with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy allowed for elemental analyses of the modified surfaces, including the recognition of exogenous elements imbedded within the modifications. Finally, micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) was performed to record how extensively a modification can affect and alter the internal structure of organic specimens.

The upper layers -layer I and II-, corresponding to the Upper Magdalenian, register the highest intensity of human activity. In this paper, we analyse raw material functionality at the site through the study of cut-marks found on bone remains. At Coímbre, we have documented mainly quartzite, followed by flint; other raw materials are found in very low frequencies. There are several types of local quartzite that appear mainly as flaking debitage and stone tools such as burins and scrappers. On the other hand, flint is mainly knapped to elaborate blades and bladelets, as well as specialised implements, such as different types of side scrappers. Retouched flakes on flint are relatively more abundant than those made on quartzite. In this paper we employ the use of photogrammetry, geometric morphometrics and statistics to analyse the cut-marks from the Upper Magdalenian assemblage of Coímbre cave. Our aim is to determine the lithic raw material preferentially used for carcass processing at the site. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Cut marks; Geometric morphometrics; Magdalenian; Raw material; Taphonomy","bone; cave; morphometry; Paleolithic; photogrammetry; quartzite; taphonomy; Asturias; Spain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059624706

Several of these archaeological sites have yielded numerous hominin fossils and traces of their activities, thus offering invaluable insights into the nature and origins of human behavior. Nevertheless, certain taphonomic discussions that have been of great importance for the study of the South African cave sites have remained unnoticed in East Africa. One of these issues revolves around the interpretation of Paranthropus as a common prey of predators. In this paper, we analyze the postcranial remains of OH80, a partial skeleton of a Paranthropus boisei discovered at the BK site (Bell Korongo, Bed II of Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania) in 2010. Some of the specimens of this skeleton have been reported to show surface modifications tentatively associated to the action of carnivores. Here, several pits observed on OH80-12, the Paranthropus boisei femur, were digitally reconstructed and analyzed through geometric morphometrics to determine the nature of the marks. The OH80-12 marks are compared with a modern sample of percussion marks and several carnivore tooth pits, since the action of both agents has previously been identified at the site and can sometimes result in equifinality problems. Alongside already published geometric morphometric tests, here we present a very newly developed approach based on the combination of geometric morphometric data and the training of machine learning algorithms. Both methodologies highlight that OH80 was consumed by carnivores, being a felid the most likely modifying agent. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Geometric morphometrics; Machine learning; OH80; Paranthropus; Percussion marks; Tooth pits","bone; fossil record; hominid; machine learning; morphometry; paleontology; predator; skeletal remains; skull; taphonomy; tooth; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania; Felidae; Paranthropus; Paranthropus boisei",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066241999

Many papers have considered carnivore ecology and the bone altering behaviour of different animals since the development of taphonomic research since the 1980's, as part of the hunter vs scavenging debate to understand early hominin sites. Hyenas have been the most studied carnivore, followed by felids and lastly canids. Within felids, lions and leopards have been the focus of most research, whereas other agents, such as jaguars or tigers are still relatively uncharacterised taphonomically. Here we present the results of an experimental feeding program to assess the nature and extent of alterations that captive jaguars can produce on horse (Equus ferus caballus) appendicular bones. Working with captive animals has some limitations, namely the generally greater extent of alterations on captive-analysed assemblages in relation to their wild counterparts. Despite this issue, we aim to start developing a broader referential framework of felid ethology that includes jaguars, a relevant taphonomic agent for understanding bone assemblages of the European and American Pleistocene. Therefore, in this preliminary study on the taphonomy of jaguars, we aim to show their prowess as bone-altering agent, capable of generating tooth-marks on long limb bone diaphyses and epiphyseal deletion. The taphonomic behaviour of jaguars has not been documented experimentally in any detail so far. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Captivity; Equus ferus caballus; Panthera onca; Taphonomy; Tooth marks","archaeological evidence; carnivore; experimental study; feeding behavior; felid; fossil record; paleontology; Pleistocene; scavenging (feeding); taphonomy; tooth; Europe; United States; Animalia; Canidae; Equidae; Equus caballus; Felidae; Panthera onca",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065609617

We analysed the cut-marks by means of three-dimensional reconstruction techniques, showing how they were made with both flint and quartzite. This interpretation is in line with the lithic assemblage found at the site, with both materials amply represented.

Identification of micro-morphological variability between different taphonomical alterations on ancient bone allows detection and comparison of bone-surface modifications and associated taphonomical agents and activities. By taking a geometrical-morphometrical approach, data from 3-D laser-scanning and micro-photogrammetrical models of experimental cut-marks enable statistical analysis to classify and distinguish between cut-marks by bifaces from those by flakes, and, in each case, between marks made by flint from those made by quartzite tools. Analysis of two tool types, each made from two raw materials as independent variables, is a methodological advance in morphometrical studies of experimental cut-marks, which hitherto have tended to focus on the respective parts played by tool types or types of raw material in morphometrical characterization of experimental and archaeological cut-marks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Cut-marks; Experimental archaeology; High-resolution taphonomy; Multivariate statistics; Palaeolithic technology; Raw materials","archaeological evidence; archaeology; artifact; experimental study; flint; geometry; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Paleolithic; quartzite; taphonomy; technology adoption; three-dimensional modeling; tool use",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065551301
