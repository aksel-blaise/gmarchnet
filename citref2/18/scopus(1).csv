Morphometric studies most often use the arrangements of morphological landmarks as the data source and extract shape information from them by Procrustes superimposition. The MorphoJ software combines this approach with a wide range of methods for shape analysis in different biological contexts. The program offers an integrated and user-friendly environment for standard multivariate analyses such as principal components, discriminant analysis and multivariate regression as well as specialized applications including phylogenetics, quantitative genetics and analyses of modularity in shape data.

As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Canonical variate analysis; Linear discriminant function; Ordination; Principal component analysis; Procrustes; Selection gradient",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952312407

As in any empirical analysis, the assessment of inter- and intra-observer error is desirable. A review of methods currently being employed to assess measurement error in geometric morphometrics was conducted and three general approaches to the problem were identified. One such approach employs Generalized Procrustes Analysis to superimpose repeatedly digitized landmark configurations, thereby establishing whether repeat measures fall within an acceptable range of variation. The potential problem of this error assessment method (the ""Pinocchio effect"") is demonstrated and its effect on error studies discussed. An alternative approach involves employing Euclidean distances between the configuration centroid and repeat measures of a landmark to assess the relative repeatability of individual landmarks. This method is also potentially problematic as the inherent geometric properties of the specimen can result in misleading estimates of measurement error. A third approach involved the repeated digitization of landmarks with the specimen held in a constant orientation to assess individual landmark precision. This latter approach is an ideal method for assessing individual landmark precision, but is restrictive in that it does not allow for the incorporation of instrumentally defined or Type III landmarks. Hence, a revised method for assessing landmark error is proposed and described with the aid of worked empirical examples. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Measurement error; Morphometrics; Pinocchio effect; Precision","accuracy; analytical error; article; empiricism; geometry; morphometrics; quantitative analysis; theory; Anthropometry; Bone and Bones; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547911458

However, investigators using DFA must account for (1) the possibility of correct classification due to chance alone, and (2) the influence of prior probabilities of group membership on classification results. A search of the recent otolith chemistry literature showed that these two concerns are sometimes ignored, so we used simulated data sets to explore the potential pitfalls of such oversights. We found that when estimating reclassification success for a training data set, small sample sizes or unbalanced sampling designs can produce remarkably high reclassification success rates by chance alone, especially when prior probabilities are estimated from sample size. When using a training data set to classify unknown individuals, maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions and group membership afforded up to 20% improvement over DFA with uninformative priors when groups contributed to the sample unequally. Given these results, we recommend the use of (1) randomization tests to estimate the probability that reclassification success is better than random, and (2) maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions in place of uninformative priors. © Inter-Research 2007.","Classification; Discriminant function analysis; Jackknife reclassification success; Null hypothesis; Otolith chemistry; Prior probabilities; Randomization test","classification; data set; discriminant analysis; marine ecosystem; maximum likelihood analysis; otolith; probability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846990136

However, the accuracy of these assessments has never been evaluated. Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes).

While several attributes usually help define a "" type,"" shape is invariably the most important. Here I report on a study that uses landmark-based geometric morphometrics to better define three Paleoindian point types from Florida: Suwannees, Simpsons, and Transitional Side Notched. Bilaterally symmetric specimens were created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating the types. The results show that the base configurations were best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife allocation tests. The entire point shape was less robust due to the variability in blade shape. The study demonstrates that the three point types can be rigorously defined in ways that are usable in daily archaeological practice, and that base shape, rather than the entire shape, is a better discriminator. Further, the study demonstrates the utility of using several freeware programs for processing and analyzing shape data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Geometric morphometrics; Hafting; Landmarks; Paleoindian; Symmetry; Typology","archaeology; artifact; geometry; morphometry; symmetry; typology; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857117297

The symmetrical, bifluted form allowed a split, facial-contact haft to extend nearly to the tip, thereby controlling both location and extent of fracture and allowing many cycles of point reworking. Extreme thinnes achieved by fluting facilitated leading edge sharpness for enhanced penetration. The near-constant cross-section from tip to base meant no loss of leading edge acuteness upon resharpening and inter-changeability of broken segments. The high-friction, forwardly adjustable haft assured firm mounting even with shortened, reused point segments. This efficient design was critical for groups who spent weeks and maybe months away from raw material sources in pursuit of game. Short, exhausted Folsom points or 'slugs' are what archaeologists most commonly find and study. In contrast, a quite long, fully fluted point made from a yet longer preform was the intended product of the Folsom knapper. The model presented here can be tested through study of preform length, finished point proportions, fracture patterns, haft element features, and use-wear analysis in archaeological specimens, as well as actualistic hunting experiments. The engine driving persistent use of snap blade, full fluted projectile technology was focused commitment to a single, highly mobile game species (bison). This specific technofunctional element in Folsom culture reveals a weapon system designed to mitigate against extreme risk regarding access to raw material. Continuing research should demonstrate that the appearance, geographic distribution, persistence, and disappearance of the Folsom fluted point relate closely to juxtapositions of climatic change, biotic change, and human population movements that occurred near the end of the Pleistocene.

Clovis may be the best documented Paleoamerican culture in North America, but much remains to be learned about the movement and interactions of Clovis peoples. Similarities among Clovis points from geographically diverse locations have led some researchers to suggest that a uniform projectile point technology existed across North America during Clovis times. Others have rejected this idea, proposing local and independent technological adaptations to different regional environments. To investigate these ideas, we used digital morphometrics to analyze 50 Clovis points from nine different contexts. First, 3D surface models of the points were created with a portable laser scanner. Next, these models were digitally cross-sectioned through both faces, yielding two-dimensional isoheight contours of flake scar patterns that reflect the original reduction techniques used to shape the projectile points. In the final step, the contours were transformed with elliptic Fourier analysis into Fourier coefficient series, and patterns of variation and symmetry were explored with principal components analysis. When compared to modern Clovis point replicas made by an expert knapper, the flake scar contours of the ancient Clovis points showed little morphological variation and a large degree of bifacial symmetry. Our results support the existence of a widespread standardized ""Clovis"" knapping technique, most likely transmitted through direct interaction between knappers from different groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","3D scanning; Contour analysis; Lithic technology; Morphology; Paleoindians; Pleistocene","archaeological evidence; artifact; digital image; morphometry; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; three-dimensional modeling; tool use; North America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862121378

Morphometric methods have played an increasingly large role in such quantitative assessments. However, standard approaches to morphometric analyses are often poorly suited to many artifact types as much variation of interest to archeologists cannot be quantified adequately by sparse sets of landmarks or semilandmarks. Use of measurement conventions also requires that investigators know which aspects of the artifacts under consideration are important to include at the outset of an investigation. In this review results obtained from landmark-semilandmark-based, and image pixel-based assessments of a common set of Paleoindian fluted projectile points are compared. Results confirm that, by itself, PCA is unsuited for the assessment of between-group differences irrespective of data type, but can be useful as a transformation to reduce the dimensionality of a morphological dataset while retaining its effective information content. Landmark-semilandmark data analysed using geometric morphometric methods delivered the lowest-quality results whereas image pixel data analysed by the Naïve Bayes machine-learning classifier delivered the highest. Direct analyses of artifact images using geometric morphometric methods delivered very good results. These findings suggest that the direct analyses of digital images and 3D scans, using either geometric morphometric data-analysis methods or machine-learning procedures, can provide archaeologists with tools that improve and extend the scope of their assessments of a wide range of artifact types. © 2018","Data analysis; Discriminant analysis; Machine learning; Morphometrics; North America; Paleogeography; Paleoindian; Projectile points; Quaternary; Typology","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data reduction; Discriminant analysis; Geometry; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Metadata; Pixels; Projectiles; Morphometrics; North America; Paleogeography; Paleoindian; Quaternary; Typology; Image analysis; archaeology; artifact; data assimilation; discriminant analysis; geometry; machine learning; morphometry; paleogeography; pixel; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; typology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055626269

Brown, 2915 (U9120ACD), Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina","Under certain conditions, ethnographic analogies can help to shed light on past behaviors registered in the archaeological record via observation and model-building from modern societies. In this context, ethnographic weapons are often used as morphometric models to assign a given function to archaeological projectile points. For southern Patagonia, J. Bird proposed a functional analogy between arrows used by the Ona (also known as Selk'nam), a hunter-gatherer group that inhabited northern Tierra del Fuego during historical epochs, and the type V Late Holocene projectile points from southern continental Patagonia. Based on the similarity in terms of small size and shape attributes between the type V archaeological points and Ona (Selk'nam) ethnographic arrows, Bird proposed that the former were arrow points. Here we test the morphometric analogy based on comparisons of size and shape variables defining Ona (Selk'nam) arrows from museum ethnographic collections, and type V projectile points from southern Patagonia archaeological sites. Then, we assess the relative importance of projectile point reduction as a source of morphometric variation. We compared both, archaeological and ethnographic points using geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistical analyses. Results showed significant shape differences between ethnographic and archaeological samples before and after controlling for size and reduction parameters, suggesting that both kinds of points had different designs and life histories. However, when spear-like points are included in the comparison, Ona (Selk'nam) and type V points tend to cluster together. The results obtained from this broader comparison framework suggest that, when functional diversity and reduction effects are taken into account, ethnographic weapons can be considered as useful morphometric models to infer the function of archaeological points. Our results highlight the importance of considering similarities in environment, subsistence, mobility, tool design constraints, and lithic characteristics prior any extrapolation based on ethnographic analogies. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Archaeological projectile points; Ethnographic analogy; Ethnographic arrows; Geometric morphometrics; Southernmost Patagonia",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049727111
