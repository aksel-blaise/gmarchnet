Elliptic properties of the Fourier coefficients are shown and used for a convenient and intuitively pleasing procedure of normalizing a Fourier contour representation. Extension of the contour representation to arbitrary objects at arbitrary aspect angle is discussed.

However, while analyses of phenotypic variation across pairs of evolutionary levels (populations or time steps) are well established, methods for testing hypotheses that compare evolutionary sequences across multiple levels are less developed. Here we describe a general analytical procedure for quantifying and comparing patterns of phenotypic evolution. The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space. Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape), are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa, and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa. This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including: phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth, local adaptation, and biomechanics. We illustrate the approach by examining the phenotypic evolution of several fossil lineages of Globorotalia. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Adaptive diversification; Morphological evolution; Ontogeny; Phenotypic change; Phenotypic plasticity; Residual randomization","adaptation; evolution; hypothesis testing; phenotypic plasticity; selection; statistical analysis; adaptation; animal; article; biological model; ecology; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; phenotype; phylogeny; species differentiation; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecology; Evolution; Fossils; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Globorotalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-64749098726

Location: Investigations were performed simultaneously on olive stones from extant wild populations, extant cultivated varieties from various Mediterranean countries, and archaeological assemblages of Spanish, French and Italian settlements. Methods: A combination of morphometrics (traditional and geometrical) allowed us to study both the size and shape of endocarp structure. Concerning shape, a size-standardized method coupled with fitted polynomial regression analysis was performed. Results: We found morphological criteria for discriminating between wild and cultivated olive cultivars, and established patterns of morphological variation of olive material according to the geographical origin (for extant material) and to the age of the olive forms (for archaeological material). Levels of morphological convergences and divergences between wild olive populations and cultivated varieties are presented as evidence. Main conclusions: Morphological changes of endocarps of olive under domestication at both geographical and chronological scales provide new criteria for the identification of olive cultivars. They allow to determine the origins of cultivated forms created and/or introduced in the north-western Mediterranean regions and to understand how human migrations affected the rest of the Western Mediterranean regions. A model of diffusion of olive cultivation is proposed. It shows evidence of an indigenous origin of the domestication process, which is currently recognized in the north-western area since the Bronze Age.","Domestication; Historical biogeography; Mediterranean basin; Morphometrics; Olea europaea l","biogeography; domestication; fruit; morphology; morphometry; Olea europaea; Olea europaea; Olea europaea var. sylvestris",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-9144266291

Here, analysis of variation in seed morphology aims to provide accurate criteria for the discrimination between wild grapes and modern cultivars and to understand changes in functional traits in relation to the domestication process. This approach is also used to quantify the phenotypic diversity in the wild and cultivated compartments and to provide a starting point for comparing well-preserved archaeological material, in order to elucidate the history of grapevine varieties. METHODS: Geometrical analysis (elliptic Fourier transform method) was applied to grapevine seed outlines from modern wild individuals, cultivars and well-preserved archaeological material from southern France, dating back to the first to second centuries. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Significant relationships between seed shape and taxonomic status, geographical origin (country or region) of accessions and parentage of varieties are highlighted, as previously noted based on genetic approaches. The combination of the analysis of modern reference material and well-preserved archaeological seeds provides original data about the history of ancient cultivated forms, some of them morphologically close to the current 'Clairette' and 'Mondeuse blanche' cultivars. Archaeobiological records seem to confirm the complexity of human contact, exchanges and migrations which spread grapevine cultivation in Europe and in Mediterranean areas, and argue in favour of the existence of local domestication in the Languedoc (southern France) region during Antiquity.",,"article; Europe; evolution; Fourier analysis; genetics; grape; physiology; plant seed; prenatal development; Europe; Evolution; Fourier Analysis; Seeds; Vitis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952960951

Whereas standard multivariate statistics procedures are fine for ""static"" variation - testing for location differences of groups in multivariate data spaces - they are limited for ""dynamic"" variation - testing specific differences in the ways groups change locations associated with changes in state along ecological, developmental or evolutionary gradients. In this paper, we show that continuous phenotypic change can be described by trajectories in multivariate data spaces. We describe the geometric attributes of phenotypic change trajectories (size, direction, and shape), specifically for GM data. We illustrate, with examples, how differences in such attributes can function as test statistics for comparative analyses in order to understand the mechanisms that produce dynamic differences in shape change. We demonstrate that analysis of such attributes - called phenotypic trajectory analysis (PTA) - is a general analysis that can be applied to various types of research questions concerned with measuring dynamic variation.

Molecular genetics has the potential to make an important contribution, especially by enabling the number of times that a crop or animal was domesticated to be determined. Molecular genetics can also assign approximate dates to domestication events, identify the wild progenitor of a domesticate, and provide new forms of evidence relevant to agricultural spread. With wheat, molecular genetical studies of modern plants have suggested that einkorn was domesticated just once but that emmer might have been domesticated more than once. Ancient DNA studies of animal remains have benefited from progress made with equivalent analyses of human bones, and with plant material there have been clear demonstrations of DNA preservation in desiccated seeds. Charred remains have also been shown to contain ancient DNA but this finding is unexpected in view of the high temperatures to which these seeds have supposedly been exposed.

Using image analysis techniques, seeds from two Sardinian archaeological sites, the pre-Nuragic and Nuragic complex of Sa Osa in central-western Sardinia, attested as the oldest Sardinian archaeological site with remains of Vitis seeds, and the Isola di Coltellazzo in southwest Sardinia, were selected and characterized on the basis of morphological features and Elliptic Fourier Descriptors. Moreover, seeds of five modern populations of V. vinifera ssp. sylvestris collected from southwest Sardinia and the seeds of 41 cultivars of V. vinifera ssp. vinifera mainly from southern and central-western Sardinia were also analysed by computer image analysis. The obtained data were used to implement a database of biometric parameters and to compare the unknown archaeological seeds with the characterized recent seeds, using Linear Discriminant Analysis. The similarity of the archaeological seeds to V. vinifera ssp. vinifera cultivars rather than to V. vinifera ssp. sylvestris populations could allow it to be stated that, between the Middle and Final Bronze Age, varieties very close to modern V. vinifera ssp. vinifera were already being used to produce wine and/or to be preserved for foodstuffs. Moreover, the better matching of the archaeological seeds to white grapes rather than black grape cultivars could indicate the origins of the traditional cultivation of white grapes in these regions of Sardinia. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Archaeological grape pips; Computer image analysis; Sardinia; Seed morphometry; V. sylvestris; V. vinifera","Osa; Pips; Vitaceae; Vitis; Vitis vinifera",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875548048

Location Seeds of uncultivated Phoenix individuals from isolated Oman populations, cultivated date palm varieties of various geographical origins and other related Phoenix species were analysed. Additionally, well-preserved seeds from Egyptian archaeological sites (14th century bc to 8th century ad) were compared with the morphometric reference model based on the analysis of modern material. Methods Elliptic Fourier transforms (EFT), a morphometric method applied to shape outline analysis, were used to characterize seed shape and to quantify morphological diversity in P. dactylifera and related species. Results Analysis of seed outlines by EFT (1) showed that P. dactylifera can be differentiated from other Phoenix species and (2) enabled the quantification of patterns of shape differentiation in the genus Phoenix at different taxonomic, geographical and chronological levels. Date palm agrobiodiversity, partitioned in distinct morphotypes, appeared to be complex in terms of geographical structure. Allocation of archaeological seeds to different modern Phoenix forms and date palm morphotypes allowed us to reveal ancient forms consumed and/or exploited in Egypt and finally to determine spatial and temporal changes in agrobiodiversity. Main conclusions Based on the morphological diversity quantified in P. dactylifera and related species, we characterized ancestral seed shape features present in uncultivated populations. The geographical distribution pattern of seed shapes points to human dispersal routes that spread cultivation from one or more initial 'domestication centres'. Finally, this work provides a powerful tool to identify ancient forms as demonstrated by the analysis of well-preserved Egyptian archaeological seeds, dating from the 14th century bc to the 8th century ad. Results open new and fascinating perspectives on the investigation of the origins and chrono-geographical fluctuation of date palm agrobiodiversity. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agrobiodiversity; Date palm; Domestication; Egypt; Elliptic Fourier transforms; Historical biogeography; Phoenix dactylifera; Seed shape","archaeology; chronology; cultivation; dating method; domestication; evergreen tree; Fourier transform; functional morphology; geometry; morphometry; morphotype; population structure; seed; taxonomy; Oman; Phoenix dactylifera",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859839004

The maximum temperature was 600°C, the time of exposure was 60 min and the heating rate between 1 and 100°C/min. Length, width, area, mass loss and reflectance of uncarbonised and carbonised grains were measured as a function of the variables. The main effects of charring are an increase in width, decrease in length and formation of protrusions. Reflectance measurements allow for the determination of the temperature at which carbonisation occurred. The occurrence of protrusions on the pericarp, longitudinal imprints in the pericarp and concave flanks are observed and discussed.

However, the domestication process remains largely unknown. Crucial unanswered questions concern the duration of the process (rapid or slow?) and the related geographical area (single or multiple-origins?). Seeds from domesticated grapevine and from its wild ancestor are reported to differ according to shape. Our work aims, first, to confirm this difference and secondly to identify the extent of domestication in the grapes cultivated by Romans in Southern France during the period 50 BCE-500 CE. We had the opportunity to analyze uncharred waterlogged grape pips from 17 archaeological sites. Based on an extended reference sample of modern wild grapevines and cultivars our work shows that both subspecies can be discriminated using simple measurements. The elongation gradient of the pip's body and stalk may be regarded as an indicator of the strength of the selection pressures undergone by domesticated grapes. Grapevines cultivated during the Roman period included a mix of morphotypes comprising wild, intermediate and moderately selected domesticated forms. Our data point to a relative shift towards more selected types during the Roman period. Domestication of the grapevine appears to have been a slow process. This could result from the recurrent incorporation into cultivation of plants originating from sexual reproduction, when grape cultivation essentially relies on vegetative propagation. © 2013 Bouby et al.",,"archeology; article; bioarcheology; controlled study; cultivar; cultural anthropology; domestication; France; genetic selection; grape; morphotype; nonhuman; plant stem; plant structures; species cultivation; species difference; vegetative propagation; wild type; Archaeology; Crops, Agricultural; France; Vitis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877726949

In particular, we explored the usefulness of considering adaptive genes as indicators of past selective pressures acting on crops, during their spread through Europe. In some areas, such as the Alpine region, Britain and Scandinavia, we have evidence to suggest that the adaptation of crops to certain climatic conditions may have contributed to the timing of agricultural spread. At the northern fringes of Europe, and in higher altitude locations in central Europe, the introduction of more suitably adapted cereals may have facilitated successful agriculture to trigger agricultural expansion.

However, the collection of 3D morphometric data from a large number of samples or in the field is currently limited by methods that are either too costly, too time-consuming or lack portability. We present a new R package, StereoMorph, for the rapid and accurate collection of 3D landmarks and curves using two standard digital cameras. StereoMorph provides a complete set of tools for every step in the collection of 3D landmarks and curves using a stereo camera set-up. This includes image processing and optimization functions for automated camera calibration using a checkerboard pattern, an easy-to-use application for digitizing landmarks and curves from photographs, and tools for reconstructing points and curves in 3D. The image processing tools and digitizing application are readily applicable to 2D morphometrics as well, enabling 2D landmarks and curves to be digitized and scaled automatically using a checkerboard pattern. We include five examples that demonstrate key functionalities of StereoMorph: automated detection of checkerboard corners, camera calibration, testing calibration accuracy, digitizing photographs and 3D curve reconstruction. With a set-up costing less than $1500, we show that it is possible to achieve a mean reconstruction error of less than 30 microns. Once the cameras are assembled, specimens can be photographed as quickly as with 2D morphometrics while digitizing takes two to three times as long as digitizing a single photograph. We conclude by presenting an accompanying tutorial which details all of the steps required to collect 3D landmarks and curves using StereoMorph. Additionally, we present a web blog that will provide a platform for updates and user questions and suggestions. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Bioinformatics; Evolutionary biology; Phylogenetics; Software",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925270506

In this study, we investigate the effect of experimental heating on two types of glume wheat grain (einkorn and emmer) under a range of conditions, with the intention of establishing the likely parameters for the generation of virtually undamaged, undistorted charred cereal grain on archaeological sites. The results show that grain morphology is very sensitive to the charring conditions, especially temperature, and that well preserved grains with little distortion are produced at relatively low temperatures (220–240°C). The implications of these findings for the study of grain morphology, biomolecules and chemical composition are assessed.

(domesticated grapevine) remain largely unknown. Shape and size have long been used as criteria to distinguish between wild and domesticated grape pips. Here we have analyzed variations of seed morphology in order to provide accurate criteria for the discrimination of different groups of varieties. Diversity in present-day cultivars and wild grapevines of Greek and east Mediterranean origin in relation to other Asiatic and European varieties and wild grapevines provides the basis for our analysis, which aims to allow the characterization of the ancient diversity of cultivated grapes in relation to present-day cultivars. Geometric morphometric analyses (Elliptic Fourier Transform method) have been used to characterize the seed shape and size of modern and archaeological material using 40 variables per seed. 197 archaeological grape pips from the 7th century bc sanctuary of Hera in Samos, Greece were compared with an extended reference collection of 269 modern cultivars and 83 wild populations, 10,518 seeds in total. Our study confirms the relationships between seed shape and domestication. Modern diversity is partly structured by the geographical origin of cultivars, but influence of other factors may play a significant role in clustering. The wide diversity of varieties offered at the Heraion of Samos during the Archaic Period, including cultivars growing on the island, imported grapes and wild morphotypes, is related to the history and geographical location of the island as well as to the diversity in the geographical range of pilgrims making offerings to the sanctuary. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Archaeobotany; Archaic Period; Diversity; Geometric morphometry; Grape pip morphology; Viticulture","Vitaceae; Vitis; Vitis vinifera",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027925243

In southern France this cereal is common in carbonized contexts such as cultural layers, ditches, pits, hearths, etc. The distinction between the two subspecies, two-rowed (. Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L.) and six-rowed barley (. H.vulgare subsp. vulgare L.) is usually based on morphological characters. The following criteria can be used to discriminate both subspecies from archaeological remains: the number of fertile spikelets per rachis segments, the linear or horseshoe shape depression of the lemma base, the maximum width of the caryopses and the proportion of twisted grains. The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for two-rowed barley is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of two-rowed barley in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1st to the 11th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Archaeobotany; Cereal grains; Experimental charring; Identification; Medieval period; Roman period","agricultural history; archaeological evidence; archaeology; barley; cultivation; experimental study; identification method; Medieval; morphometry; Roman era; agriculture; botany; cereal; France; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886302631

Ignazio da Laconi 11-13, Cagliari, 09123, Italy","The identification of archaeological charred grape seeds is a difficult task due to the alteration of the morphological seeds shape. In archaeobotanical studies, for the correct discrimination between Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris and Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera grape seeds it is very important to understand the history and origin of the domesticated grapevine. In this work, different carbonisation experiments were carried out using a hearth to reproduce the same burning conditions that occurred in archaeological contexts. In addition, several carbonisation trials on modern wild and cultivated grape seeds were performed using a muffle furnace. For comparison with archaeological materials, modern grape seed samples were obtained using seven different temperatures of carbonisation ranging between 180 and 340°C for 120 min. Analysing the grape seed size and shape by computer vision techniques, and applying the stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method, discrimination of the wild from the cultivated charred grape seeds was possible. An overall correct classification of 93.3% was achieved. Applying the same statistical procedure to compare modern charred with archaeological grape seeds, found in Sardinia and dating back to the Early Bronze Age (2017-1751 2σ cal. BC), allowed 75.0% of the cases to be identified as wild grape. The proposed method proved to be a useful and effective procedure in identifying, with high accuracy, the charred grape seeds found in archaeological sites. Moreover, it may be considered valid support for advances in the knowledge and comprehension of viticulture adoption and the grape domestication process. The same methodology may also be successful when applied to other plant remains, and provide important information about the history of domesticated plants. © 2016 Ucchesu et al.

But did these two streams have a common point of origin in south-west Asia, at least with regard to the principal plant and animals species that were involved? This study of barley DNA shows that the domesticated barley grown in Neolithic Europe falls into three separate types (groups A, B and C), each of which may have had a separate centre of origin in south-west Asia. Barley was relatively rarely cultivated by the early Linearbandkeramik farmers of Central and Northern Europe, but became more common during the fifth and fourth millennia BC. The analysis reported here indicates that a genetic variety of barley more suitable for northern growing conditions was introduced from south-west Asia at this period. It also suggests that the barley grown in south-eastern Europe at the very beginning of the Neolithic may have arrived there by different routes from two separate centres of domestication in south-west Asia. The multiple domestications that this pattern reveals imply that domestication may have been more a co-evolutionary process between plants and people than an intentional human action. © Antiquity Publications Ltd.","Barley; Domestication; Europe; Neolithic; Origins of agriculture",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883299252

The distinction between most of the Prunus species, based on traditional morphological characters of the fruit stones, is usually not problematic. However the discrimination between P. avium L., P. cerasus L. and related cherry species, based on classical criteria alone, often turns out to be ambiguous because of the increasing number of varieties which have been bred since Roman times. By combining geometric and traditional morphometrical approaches, the overall variation in shape and size of stones from French and Swiss excavations dating from the 1st century to the 16th century a. d. were assessed. Among these important archaeobotanical data, the detailed examination of 100 waterlogged stones from the 16th century Hôtel-Dieu cesspit at Tours, France, revealed that the morphological diversity is structured into two distinct morphotypes which diverge mainly according to geometrical features. Finally, the comparison between morphological features of these well-preserved archaeological stones and modern reference material including P. avium, P. cerasus and P. × gondouinii, suggests that these two morphotypes, which have been initially attributed to P. avium (long stones) and P. avium/cerasus (rounded stones) according to traditional morphological parameters, would correspond to two different cultivated varieties, both belonging to Prunus avium. Results presented in this work constitute new and preliminary data obtained during the development of this project that throw light on morphological variability and biosystematic aspects. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Agrobiodiversity; Archaeobiology; Cultivars; Morphometrics; Morphotypes; Prunus avium","Prunus; Prunus avium; Prunus cerasus; Prunus domestica; Prunus persica; Rosaceae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051860613

P. Beauv. (foxtail millet) was originally domesticated in northern China. The time and route of its introduction into South Asia is currently unclear due to the possible confusion with autochthonous Brachiaria ramosa (L.) Stapf. (browntop millet). Geometric morphometrics (GM) offer an alternative to traditional archaeobotanical methods to distinguish between these two small millet species. This study aims at finding a method to securely distinguish among charred caryopses of S. italica and B. ramosa, testing its validity on archaeobotanical assemblages and proposing a new approach for studying the dispersion of S. italica throughout Eurasia. Modern S. italica (n = 35) and B. ramosa (n = 34) caryopses and 15 archaeological specimens from a 5th millennium bp archaeological occupation site in northwestern India were analysed. Archaeological and modern caryopses (before and after charring) were photographed with a Leica EZ4D stereoscope, and TPSdig software was used to scale the photographs and manually apply a configuration of three landmarks and six semi-landmarks onto the contours of the embryos. Multivariate statistics were carried out to analyse the shape differences between modern S. italica and B. ramosa and to classify the archaeological specimens. The results show that the shape of the embryo of both species can be clearly distinguished using a GM-approach, both before and after charring. However, charring tends to smooth the shape differences between the two groups, which may affect the interpretation of archaeobotanical assemblages. The comparison between modern and archaeological caryopses suggests that S. italica was not present in northwestern India during the 5th millennium bp. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Archaeobotany; Crop dispersal; Geometric morphometrics; Identification criteria; Shape analysis; Small millets",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937149140
