As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

These include restricted permutations, permutation of whole groups of units, permutation of some form of residuals or some combination of these. It is unclear, especially for complex designs involving random factors, mixed models or nested hierarchies, just which permutation strategy should be used for any particular test. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (i) we provide a guideline for constructing an exact permutation strategy, where possible, for any individual term in any ANOVA design; and (ii) we provide results of Monte Carlo simulations to compare the level accuracy and power of different permutation strategies in two-way ANOVA, including random and mixed models, nested hierarchies and tests of interaction terms. Simulation results showed that permutation of residuals under a reduced model generally had greater power than the exact test or alternative approximate permutation methods (such as permutation of raw data). In several cases, restricted permutations, in particular, suffered more than other procedures, in terms of loss of power, challenging the conventional wisdom of using this approach. Our simulations also demonstrated that the choice of correct exchangeable units under the null hypothesis, in accordance with the guideline we provide, is essential for any permutation test, whether it be an exact test or an approximate test. For reference, we also provide appropriate permutation strategies for individual terms in any two-way or three-way ANOVA for the exact test (where possible) and for the approximate test using permutation of residuals.","ANOVA; Experimental design; Fixed and random factors; Hierarchical designs; Mixed models; Non-parametric; Randomization tests; Resampling methods",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037319490

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

Since that time the field of geometric morphometrics has matured into a rich and cohesive discipline for the study of shape variation and covariation. The development of the field is identified with the Procrustes paradigm, a methodological approach to shape analysis arising from the intersection of the statistical shape theory and analytical procedures for obtaining shape variables from landmark data. In this review we describe the Procrustes paradigm and the current methodological toolkit of geometric morphometrics. We highlight some of the theoretical advances that have occurred over the past ten years since our prior review (Adams et al., 2004), what types of anatomical structures are amenable to these approaches, and how they extend the reach of geometric morphometrics to more specialized applications for addressing particular biological hypotheses.

However, while analyses of phenotypic variation across pairs of evolutionary levels (populations or time steps) are well established, methods for testing hypotheses that compare evolutionary sequences across multiple levels are less developed. Here we describe a general analytical procedure for quantifying and comparing patterns of phenotypic evolution. The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space. Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape), are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa, and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa. This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including: phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth, local adaptation, and biomechanics. We illustrate the approach by examining the phenotypic evolution of several fossil lineages of Globorotalia. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Adaptive diversification; Morphological evolution; Ontogeny; Phenotypic change; Phenotypic plasticity; Residual randomization","adaptation; evolution; hypothesis testing; phenotypic plasticity; selection; statistical analysis; adaptation; animal; article; biological model; ecology; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; phenotype; phylogeny; species differentiation; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecology; Evolution; Fossils; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Globorotalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-64749098726

It is common for researchers in these disciplines to work with multivariate phenotypic data. When phenotypic variables exceed the number of research subjects - data called 'high-dimensional data' - researchers are confronted with analytical challenges. Parametric tests that require high observation to variable ratios present a paradox for researchers, as eliminating variables potentially reduces effect sizes for comparative analyses, yet test statistics require more observations than variables. This problem is exacerbated with data that describe 'multidimensional' phenotypes, whereby a description of phenotype requires high-dimensional data. For example, landmark-based geometric morphometric data use the Cartesian coordinates of (potentially) many anatomical landmarks to describe organismal shape. Collectively such shape variables describe organism shape, although the analysis of each variable, independently, offers little benefit for addressing biological questions. Here we present a nonparametric method of evaluating effect size that is not constrained by the number of phenotypic variables, and motivate its use with example analyses of phenotypic change using geometric morphometric data. Our examples contrast different characterizations of body shape for a desert fish species, associated with measuring and comparing sexual dimorphism between two populations. We demonstrate that using more phenotypic variables can increase effect sizes, and allow for stronger inferences. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"developmental biology; evolutionary biology; geometry; morphometry; phenotype; phenotypic plasticity; sexual dimorphism; theoretical study; anatomy and histology; animal; biological model; evolution; female; genetics; killifish; male; nonparametric test; phenotype; sexual development; Animals; Biological Evolution; Female; Killifishes; Male; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Sex Characteristics; Statistics, Nonparametric",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924570789

Distinctive types of specialization develop in response to various social, economic, and environmental factors, including the demand for crafts, the social relations of producers, and the support base for artisans. These factors in turn influence manufacturing technology. Thus, different types of specialization can be characterized by a technological profile, which reflects relative labor investment, skill, and standardization. An analysis of Prehispanic ceramic technology in the central sierra of Peru demonstrates how these technological profiles can be used to identify the ways ceramic production was organized to provision consumers with utilitarian and luxury pottery. As we demonstrate in our analysis of pottery recovered in the Yanamarca Valley, utilitarian Wanka-style cookwares and storage jars were produced by independent household-based artisans, while imperial Inka-style jars were produced by locally recruited corvee labor working for the state.

Some examples include phenotypic changes due to phenotypic plasticity between two environments, changes due to predator/non-predator character shifts, character displacement via competitive interactions, and patterns of sexual dimorphism. However, methods for analyzing phenotypic change for multivariate data have not been rigorously developed. Here we outline a method for testing vectors of phenotypic change in terms of two important attributes: the magnitude of change (vector length) and the direction of change described by trait covariation (angular difference between vectors). We describe a permutation procedure for testing these attributes, which allows non-targeted sources of variation to be held constant. We provide examples that illustrate the importance of considering vector attributes of phenotypic change in biological studies, and we demonstrate how greater inference can be made than by evaluating variance components with MANOVA alone. Finally, we consider how our method may be extended to more complex data. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Geometric morphometrics; Multivariate; Phenotypic; Vector","competition (ecology); environmental change; multivariate analysis; phenotypic plasticity; predator; sexual dimorphism; Amphibia; analysis of variance; animal; article; comparative study; computer simulation; Cyprinodontiformes; ecosystem; histology; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; phenotype; sexual development; statistical analysis; theoretical model; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Body Weights and Measures; Computer Simulation; Cyprinodontiformes; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Ecosystem; Models, Theoretical; Multivariate Analysis; Phenotype; Sex Characteristics; Urodela",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33847004334

A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the evolution of phenotypic diversity. Both natural and sexual selection play a large role in generating phenotypic adaptations, with biomechanical requirements and developmental mechanisms mediating patterns of phenotypic evolution. For many traits, the relative importance of selective and developmental components remains understudied. Results. We investigated ontogenetic trajectories of foot morphology in the eight species of European plethodontid cave salamander to test the hypothesis that adult foot morphology was adapted for climbing. Using geometric morphometrics and other approaches, we found that developmental patterns in five species displayed little morphological change during growth (isometry), where the extensive interdigital webbing in adults was best explained as the retention of the juvenile morphological state. By contrast, three species exhibited significant allometry, with an increase in interdigital webbing during growth. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that multiple evolutionary transitions between isometry and allometry of foot webbing have occurred in this lineage. Allometric parameters of foot growth were most similar to those of a tropical species previously shown to be adapted for climbing. Finally, interspecific variation in adult foot morphology was significantly reduced as compared to variation among juveniles, indicating that ontogenetic convergence had resulted in a common adult foot morphology across species. Conclusions. The results presented here provide evidence of a complex history of phenotypic evolution in this clade. The common adult phenotype exhibited among species reveals that selection plays an important part in generating patterns of foot diversity in the group. However, developmental trajectories arriving at this common morphology are distinct; with some species displaying developmental stasis (isometry), while others show an increase in foot webbing during growth. Thus, multiple developmental solutions exist to the same evolutionary challenge. Our findings underscore the importance of examining morphological adaptations from multiple perspectives, and emphasize that both selective hypotheses and developmental processes must be considered for a more comprehensive understanding of phenotypic evolution. © 2010 Adams and Nistri; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adaptation; amphibian; evolutionary biology; hypothesis testing; interspecific variation; morphology; ontogeny; phenotypic plasticity; Plethodontidae; Salamandroidea; Amphibia; animal; article; Europe; evolution; foot; genetics; histology; multivariate analysis; phenotype; phylogeny; Animals; Europe; Evolution; Foot; Multivariate Analysis; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Urodela",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954556330

In Palaeolithic archaeology's sister discipline of palaeoanthropology, detailed quantitative morphometric, geometric morphometric, and even 3D geometric morphometric analyses are now seen almost as routine. This period of relative methodological stasis may have been influenced by the lack of homologous landmarks on many lithic tools (essential for any comparative analysis), especially core-based technologies of the Lower Palaeolithic. Archaeological field conditions may also prohibit the use of expensive and delicate precision instruments in certain cases. Here we present a crossbeam co-ordinate caliper that - crucially - both geometrically locates and measures distances between morphologically homologous landmarks upon lithic nuclei via a single protocol. Intra- and inter-observer error tests provide evidence that error levels associated with the instrument fall within acceptable ranges. In addition, we present empirical examples of application in the form of a multivariate analysis of 55 discrete morphometric variables, and a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of co-ordinate landmark configurations derived from Pleistocene lithic nuclei (i.e. 'cores' sensu lato). We also introduce to lithic studies some techniques for the study of shape variation that have previously been used with success in biological morphometric analyses. We conclude that use of an instrument such as the crossbeam co-ordinate caliper may provide a useful adjunct to traditional techniques of lithic analysis, particularly in developing a quantitative morphometric approach. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, a set of experimentally produced bifacial tools are incorporated into the analyses to isolate the behavioral pattern underpinning identified variation in the archaeological assemblage. The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture. The intensity with which this strategy was applied seems to have been mediated by the availability of raw material that was suitable for the production of large bifacial tools. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes). Lastly, the absence of resharpening effects raises questions about the validity of the reduction thesis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Acheulian data set is based on previously published data with the addition here of a study of the handaxes from the site of Boxgrove, England. The MTA data set is based on four classic sites from southwest France with large handaxe collections. Both standard caliper-based morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis applied to coordinate data taken from digitized images of handaxes are used to assess shape. The result is that, contrary to expectations based on assumptions of evolving technological skill, handaxes in the MTA are as or more variable in shape than Acheulian ones. This variation is allometric in Acheulian handaxes, and is linked to resharpening from the tip down to the base, but is not related to size in the MTA samples. These results suggest that the goals and constraints of handaxe manufacture, but particularly handaxe reduction as a result of reworking during use, were quite different in the MTA and Acheulian, implying that conclusions about hominin cognition drawn from patterns in shape variability in handaxes must be understood in the context of artifact life histories. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Acheulian; Boxgrove; Elliptical Fourier analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Handaxe; Life-history; MTA; Shape variability","Acheulean; artifact; hominid; life history; morphometry; Paleolithic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956090095

While several attributes usually help define a "" type,"" shape is invariably the most important. Here I report on a study that uses landmark-based geometric morphometrics to better define three Paleoindian point types from Florida: Suwannees, Simpsons, and Transitional Side Notched. Bilaterally symmetric specimens were created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating the types. The results show that the base configurations were best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife allocation tests. The entire point shape was less robust due to the variability in blade shape. The study demonstrates that the three point types can be rigorously defined in ways that are usable in daily archaeological practice, and that base shape, rather than the entire shape, is a better discriminator. Further, the study demonstrates the utility of using several freeware programs for processing and analyzing shape data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Geometric morphometrics; Hafting; Landmarks; Paleoindian; Symmetry; Typology","archaeology; artifact; geometry; morphometry; symmetry; typology; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857117297

Our approach uses residual randomization from a generalized linear model, and allows the statistical comparison of sympatric phenotypic divergence to allopatric phenotypic divergence while accounting for phenotypic variation along a gradient. Through simulation we demonstrate that our approach correctly identifies patterns of sympatric character divergence when they are present, and does not identify such patterns when they are not.

Here, we report an attempt to resolve this argument using a large sample of Clovis points from dated assemblages and a suite of shape analysis methods known as geometric morphometrics. The study tested the two main hypotheses that have been put forward in the debate: the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis, which holds that Clovis points do not vary regionally, and the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis, which holds that there is regional variation as a consequence of Clovis groups adjusting their food-getting toolkits to local conditions. We used discriminant function analysis and a multivariate extension of the t test to assess whether differences in shape exist at two scales. The first set of analyses compared points from the most obvious environmental regions in North America, the East and the West. The second set of analyses investigated differences among points from subregions within the East and West. The analyses revealed significant differences between points from the East and the West and among points from some subregions. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these differences are not the result of the most common confounding factors, raw material quality and resharpening. As such, the analyses support the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis rather than the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis. We conclude from this that Clovis people modified their points to suit the characteristics of local prey and/or the habitats in which they hunted. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Clovis points; Continent-wide adaptation; Geometric morphometrics; Regional environmental adaptation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898651207

The Aterian is defined by the presence of 'tanged' or 'stemmed' tools, which have been widely assumed to be among the earliest projectile weapon tips. The present study systematically investigates morphological variation in a large sample of Aterian tools to test the hypothesis that these tools were hafted and/or used as projectile weapons. Methodology/Principal Findings: Both classical morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis of tool outlines are used to show that the shape variation in the sample exhibits size-dependent patterns consistent with a reduction of the tools from the tip down, with the tang remaining intact. Additionally, the process of reduction led to increasing side-to-side asymmetries as the tools got smaller. Finally, a comparison of shape-change trajectories between Aterian tools and Late Paleolithic arrowheads from the North German site of Stellmoor reveal significant differences in terms of the amount and location of the variation. Conclusions/Significance: The patterns of size-dependent shape variation strongly support the functional hypothesis of Aterian tools as hafted knives or scrapers with alternating active edges, rather than as weapon tips. Nevertheless, the same morphological patterns are interpreted as one of the earliest evidences for a hafting modification, and for the successful combination of different raw materials (haft and stone tip) into one implement, in itself an important achievement in the evolution of hominin technologies. © 2011 Radu Iovita.",,"article; elliptical Fourier analysis; fossil hominin; Fourier analysis; materials; morphometrics; Paleolithic; projectile weapon; Stone Age; tool use; weapon; weight, mass and size; archeology; devices; human; Archaeology; Equipment and Supplies; Fourier Analysis; Humans",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84455192786

Whereas standard multivariate statistics procedures are fine for ""static"" variation - testing for location differences of groups in multivariate data spaces - they are limited for ""dynamic"" variation - testing specific differences in the ways groups change locations associated with changes in state along ecological, developmental or evolutionary gradients. In this paper, we show that continuous phenotypic change can be described by trajectories in multivariate data spaces. We describe the geometric attributes of phenotypic change trajectories (size, direction, and shape), specifically for GM data. We illustrate, with examples, how differences in such attributes can function as test statistics for comparative analyses in order to understand the mechanisms that produce dynamic differences in shape change. We demonstrate that analysis of such attributes - called phenotypic trajectory analysis (PTA) - is a general analysis that can be applied to various types of research questions concerned with measuring dynamic variation.

Several Paleolithic sites with lithic assemblages attributable to the Acheulean Industrial Complex (Mode 2) have yielded bifacial bone artifacts. Many of these bone implements are similar to classic handaxes in plan shape. The arbitrary imposition of form represented by these bone bifaces suggests the deliberate application of certain operational concepts that originate from particular Acheulean technological behaviors, namely, stone handaxe manufacture. In addition, the presence of these bone tools suggests an application of specific reductive techniques that originated in both Mode 1 (i.e., Oldowan) and Mode 2 (i.e., Acheulean) lithic technologies. How does the Acheulean model for stone biface shape compare to that observed for bone biface shape? In order to understand the degree to which Acheulean stone bifaces may have served as a model of form in flaked bone technology, an objective method for evaluating form is necessary. The dimensionless approach of geometric morphometrics was applied to the study of 2D bone and stone biface plan shape. The similarity of bone and stone bifaces from the Middle Pleistocene (∼300 kya) Acheulean site Castel di Guido, Latium, Italy was evaluated by a geometric morphometric analysis of 2D outlines. The null hypothesis that there is no difference in the 2D shape of each artifact material class was tested by principal component analysis (PCA) and MANOVA/CVA of eigenshape scores. Results of the analysis show no significant difference between the plan morphology of bone and stone bifaces. These results may indicate that Acheulean concepts of preferred 2D shape were applied in the production of some bifacial bone tools and that a great disparity in raw materials did not significantly influence 2D biface morphology. Furthermore, these results lend support to the idea that Mode 2 stone flaking techniques and tool types were directly applied to bone materials in some instances. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051798141

Indeed, from the earliest commentaries on the Victoria West, it has frequently been thought of as a 'large Levallois' variant. The hypothesis that VW cores are accurately characterised as 'large Levallois' is tested here using a comparative 3D geometric morphometric (GM) methodology. GM methods are powerful statistical tools for shape analysis that offer many advantages over traditional means of shape quantification and comparison. The use of landmarks to capture shape variation allows for the preservation of the full geometry, as well as enabling the more precise description of shape versus size. Moreover, biological studies have shown that the use of landmarks allows for a flexible approach to comparing specific aspects of overall morphology. Here, we employ GM to analyse differences in core surface morphology in a range of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, including Victoria West examples (total n = 639 artefacts). In comparison with cores from non-handaxe Mode 1, Acheulean handaxes, and Levallois cores, the Victoria West share shape affinities with both Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores. However, when compared directly with a group of large Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores from Baker's Hole (UK), the Victoria West were found to more closely resemble handaxes, while the Baker's Hole set are simply isometrically-scaled Levallois cores. These analyses show that, despite broad technological and qualitative morphological similarities with Levallois cores, Victoria West cores are morphologically more similar to Lower Palaeolithic artefact forms, such as handaxes, and are in some respects distinct from Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores. In line with other recent analyses, our results support suggestions that the Victoria West technique is an extension of longstanding Acheulean traditions for the preparation of biface blanks, but with its own distinct characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent discussion has centered on issues of comparability between handaxes from eastern Asian and 'Acheulean' examples from western portions of the Old World. Here, we present a multivariate morphometric analysis in order to more fully document how Mid-Pleistocene (i.e. ~803 Kyr) handaxes from Bose Basin, China compare to examples from the west, as well as with additional (Mode 1) cores from across the Old World. Results show that handaxes from both the western Old World and Bose are significantly different from the Mode 1 cores, suggesting a gross comparability with regard to functionally-related form. Results also demonstrate overlap between the ranges of shape variation in Acheulean handaxes and those from Bose, demonstrating that neither raw material nor cognitive factors were an absolute impediment to Bose hominins in making comparable handaxe forms to their hominin kin west of the Movius Line. However, the shapes of western handaxes are different from the Bose examples to a statistically significant degree. Moreover, the handaxe assemblages from the western Old World are all more similar to each other than any individual assemblage is to the Bose handaxes. Variation in handaxe form is also comparatively high for the Bose material, consistent with suggestions that they represent an emergent, convergent instance of handaxe technology authored by Pleistocene hominins with cognitive capacities directly comparable to those of 'Acheulean' hominins. © 2012 Wang et al.",,"article; artifact; China; cognition; controlled study; cultural anthropology; geometry; handaxe; Middle Pleistocene; morphometrics; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; Stone Age; animal; archeology; cluster analysis; cognition; comparative study; history; hominid; multivariate analysis; nonparametric test; psychological aspect; tool use; Animals; Archaeology; China; Cluster Analysis; Cognition; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Multivariate Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859837713

Multivariate statistics applied to both traditional and geometric morphometric analyses failed to reveal any important changes in shape through time. However, the coefficients of variation presented a significant increase through time in three measurements related to projectile point neck and stem. The absence of change in shape might be related to small group size and low level of cultural innovation. Such cultural stability might be related to novelty-avoiding mechanisms or the operation of a meta-tradition that would be selected in very stable environments.

One prominent example of this debate is Clovis technology (13,350-12,500 calendar years before present), which represents the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America. Clovis projectile points appear to have been made the same way regardless of region, but several studies have documented differences in shape that appear to be regional. Two processes have been proposed for shape variation: (1) stochastic mechanisms such as copy error (drift) and (2) Clovis groups adapting their hunting equipment to the characteristics of prey and local habitat. We used statistical analysis of Clovis-point flake-scar pattern and geometric morphometrics to examine whether drift alone could cause significant differences in the technology of Stone Age colonizing hunter-gatherers. Importantly, our analysis was intraregional to rule out a priori environmental adaptation. Our analysis confirmed that the production technique was the same across the sample, but we found significant shape differences in Clovis point populations made from distinct stone outcrops. Given that current archaeological evidence suggests stone outcrops were ""hubs"" of regional Clovis activity, our dichotomous, intraregional results quantitatively confirm that Clovis foragers engaged in two tiers of social learning. The lower, ancestral tier relates to point production and can be tied to conformist transmission of tool-making processes across the Clovis population. The upper, derived tier relates to point shape, which can be tied to drift that resulted from increased forager interaction at different stone-outcrop hubs and decreased forager interaction among groups using different outcrops. Given that Clovis artifacts represent the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America, our results suggest that we need to alter our theoretical understanding of how quickly drift can occur within a colonizing population and create differences among socially learned technological characters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cultural transmission; Dispersals; Drift; Geometric morphometrics; Hunter-gatherers; Peopling of the Americas","archaeological evidence; archaeology; artifact; colonization; dispersal; hunter-gatherer; learning; morphometry; new world order; Pleistocene; Stone Age; North America; archeology; cultural anthropology; human; migration; North America; social learning; weapon; Archaeology; Cultural Evolution; Human Migration; Humans; North America; Social Learning; Weapons",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923363624

Projecting a phylogeny into morphospace provides estimates of evolutionary trajectories as lineages diversified information that can be used to infer the dynamics of evolutionary processes that produced patterns of morphospace occupation. We present here a large-scale investigation into evolution of morphological variation in the skull of caecilian amphibians, a major clade of vertebrates. Because caecilians are limbless, predominantly fossorial animals, diversification of their skull has occurred within a framework imposed by the functional demands of head-first burrowing. We examined cranial shape in 141 species, over half of known species, using X-ray computed tomography and geometric morphometrics. Mapping an existing phylogeny into the cranial morphospace to estimate the history of morphological change (phylomorphospace), we find a striking pattern: most species occupy distinct clusters in cranial morphospace that closely correspond to the main caecilian clades, and each cluster is separated by unoccupied morphospace. The empty spaces in shape space are unlikely to be caused entirely by extinction or incomplete sampling. The main caecilian clades have different amounts of morphological disparity, but neither clade age nor number of species account for this variation. Cranial shape variation is clearly linked to phyletic divergence, but there is also homoplasy, which is attributed to extrinsic factors associated with head-first digging: features of caecilian crania that have been previously argued to correlate with differential microhabitat use and burrowing ability, such as subterminal and terminal mouths, degree of temporal fenestration (stegokrotaphy/zygokrotaphy), and eyes covered by bone, have evolved and many combinations occur in modern species. We find evidence of morphological convergence in cranial shape, among species that have eyes covered by bone, resulting in a narrow bullet-shaped head. These results reveal a complex history, including early expansion of morphospace and both divergent and convergent evolution resulting in the diversity we observe today. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Caecilian; Geometric morphometrics; Macroevolution; Micro computed tomography; Tempo and mode",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939894501

The study reported here evaluated this hypothesis with standard and geometric morphometric data recorded on Clovis and Folsom points from the Southern Plains and Southwest that are associated with mammoth or bison remains. Points used to hunt mammoth were found to be larger and of a different shape than points used to hunt bison, which supports the hypothesis.

The term ""evolution"" and its traditionally biological connotations, however, can provide a source of confusion, which might cause hindrance to those trying to understand the growing array of case studies that utilize these methods. Given this, a brief review of the current theoretical basis for cultural evolutionary approaches is given, which largely draws on social transmission theory. Thereafter, recent advances in the field are discussed, which have involved both methodological developments and a flourishing of empirical examples of application. Finally, future directions are considered, which, as in any developing field, will probably involve further development of both its theoretical and empirical basis, and the interaction of the two. As David Clarke identified almost half a century ago, the great strength of the archaeological record is its power to reveal meaningful patterns of artifactual variation over temporal and spatial scales, especially in statistical terms. Cultural evolutionary approaches offer a set of theoretical and methodological tools to approach, discover, and scientifically analyze this potential wealth of information about past societies. Future developments will necessarily follow, but the place of this related body of theory and techniques within archaeology is now firmly established. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cultural evolution; Evolutionary archaeology; Social learning; Social transmission","archaeology; artifact; culture; evolutionary theory; learning; social theory",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928533959

Clovis may be the best documented Paleoamerican culture in North America, but much remains to be learned about the movement and interactions of Clovis peoples. Similarities among Clovis points from geographically diverse locations have led some researchers to suggest that a uniform projectile point technology existed across North America during Clovis times. Others have rejected this idea, proposing local and independent technological adaptations to different regional environments. To investigate these ideas, we used digital morphometrics to analyze 50 Clovis points from nine different contexts. First, 3D surface models of the points were created with a portable laser scanner. Next, these models were digitally cross-sectioned through both faces, yielding two-dimensional isoheight contours of flake scar patterns that reflect the original reduction techniques used to shape the projectile points. In the final step, the contours were transformed with elliptic Fourier analysis into Fourier coefficient series, and patterns of variation and symmetry were explored with principal components analysis. When compared to modern Clovis point replicas made by an expert knapper, the flake scar contours of the ancient Clovis points showed little morphological variation and a large degree of bifacial symmetry. Our results support the existence of a widespread standardized ""Clovis"" knapping technique, most likely transmitted through direct interaction between knappers from different groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","3D scanning; Contour analysis; Lithic technology; Morphology; Paleoindians; Pleistocene","archaeological evidence; artifact; digital image; morphometry; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; three-dimensional modeling; tool use; North America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862121378

Recently, two comparative methods were proposed to circumvent this difficulty. One obtains phylogenetic independent contrasts for all variables, and statistically evaluates the linear model by permuting the phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) of the response data. The other uses a distance-based approach to obtain coefficients for generalized least squares models (D-PGLS), and subsequently permutes the original data to evaluate the model effects. Here, we show that permuting PICs is not equivalent to permuting the data prior to the analyses as in D-PGLS. We further explain why PICs are not the correct exchangeable units under the null hypothesis, and demonstrate that this misspecification of permutable units leads to inflated type I error rates of statistical tests. We then show that simply shuffling the original data and recalculating the independent contrasts with each iteration yields significance levels that correspond to those found using D-PGLS. Thus, while summary statistics from methods based on PICs and PGLS are the same, permuting PICs can lead to strikingly different inferential outcomes with respect to statistical and biological inferences. © 2015 The Author(s).","Geometric morphometrics; Phylogenetic comparative method; Phylogenetic generalized least squares; Phylogenetic independent contrasts","comparative study; morphometry; phenotype; phylogenetics; statistical analysis; anatomy and histology; animal; biological model; body size; comparative study; genetics; head; phylogeny; regression analysis; statistical model; Urodela; Animals; Body Size; Head; Least-Squares Analysis; Linear Models; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Urodela",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924855024

However, comparisons of the strength of integration across datasets are difficult, in part because the summary measures that characterize these patterns (RV coefficient and rPLS) are dependent both on sample size and on the number of variables. As a solution to this issue, we propose a standardized test statistic (a z-score) for measuring the degree of morphological integration between sets of variables. The approach is based on a partial least squares analysis of trait covariation, and its permutation-based sampling distribution. Under the null hypothesis of a random association of variables, the method displays a constant expected value and confidence intervals for datasets of differing sample sizes and variable number, thereby providing a consistent measure of integration suitable for comparisons across datasets. A two-sample test is also proposed to statistically determine whether levels of integration differ between datasets, and an empirical example examining cranial shape integration in Mediterranean wall lizards illustrates its use.

Levallois technology remains an important focus for research in Palaeolithic archaeology, yet quantitative morphological comparisons of Levallois core morphology from different regions remain rare. Here, utilizing Levallois cores from Africa, the Near East, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent, patterns of morphological variability in the shape of the Levallois flaking surface and core outline (margin) shape were examined for patterns of variability and stability across regions using 3D geometric morphometrics. The multivariate statistical shape analyses undertaken revealed a clear pattern: that is, the greatest levels of shape variability in Levallois cores is evident in the form of their outline (planform) shape. Conversely, the geometrical relationship between the margin of the Levallois cores and their topological surface morphology was relatively uniform. This pattern of variability was evident in terms of variation both across regions and between cores from the same locality. These results indicate that the outline form of such cores was a less important variable than the geometric/topological properties of the surface morphology and, in particular, the relationship between the margin of the core and those variables. These results have implications for why it has been reported that replicating such cores in modern experiments is a particularly difficult task. The specific interrelationship between the geometric properties of the core and the core margin provide further evidence that Levallois core technology would be unlikely to emerge from the context of opportunistic migrating platform reduction strategies (such as those seen in many Mode 1 industries). If, as is widely suggested, Levallois cores were deliberate products in Pleistocene contexts, these results also hint that relatively sophisticated means of social transmission (i.e. teaching) may have been required to sustain their production over time and space. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Core variation; Geometric morphometric analysis; Levallois","archaeological evidence; archaeology; geometry; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; technological development; Africa; Europe; India",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871442389

The goal of this work is to evaluate size and shape variation in two late Holocene projectile point types, known as Fell. Bird, or Magallanes IV and V points or Patagónicas and Ona points, respectively. These two types are compared using geometric morphometries and multivariate statistical analyses. The reliability in the discrimination between types is tested at the light of reduction. The analyses have shown a major incidence of reduction on shape rather than on size, and on blade rather than on stem. However, in average, types IV and V can be distinguished in terms of size, and stem shape despite reduction. Thus, even though successive cycles of use, damage and resharpening have a great influence over size and shape of projectile points, resharpening techniques are specific enough to maintain the differences of size and shape between types, a pattern that is probably related with functional requirements.

We modified the median axis technique to define novel measurements, which proved complementary to those obtained from conventional landmarks. Allometric analyses showed that the scaling of the mandible among the New World tree squirrels is generally isometric (as has been observed in other groups of mammals), but diverges from isometry in a tendency in smaller animals for the masseteric ridge to be displaced anteriorly, the condylar process and posterior portion of the ascending ramus to be relatively elongated, and the coronoid process to be shortened. Allometric analyses also revealed the ways and extent that outgroup taxa deviated from the scaling pattern observed for the New World tree squirrels. A flying squirrel (subfamily Pteromyinae), a moderate-sized callosciurine squirrel, and three species of pygmy tree squirrels from Asia and Africa show mandibular proportions very similar to those predicted for New World tree squirrels of corresponding size. Ground squirrels (tribe Marmotini) and successively more distant relatives such as Aplodontia, two myomorph rodents, and a rabbit show greater differences from the New World tree squirrels in their mandibular proportions.

This practice results in confusions when large-scale assemblage comparisons are made with the aim of investigating phylogenetic relationships, as functional and cultural information is aggregated. It is argued here that functional criteria must be assessed separately, and that resharpening, as a uniform, repeated, conscious behavioral process of tool maintenance that indexes use and function, can provide a solution to this problem. The subject of this article is a quantitative method for extracting and comparing resharpening trajectories. The method is an adaptation of ontogenetic scaling methods from biology, and is based on obtaining a mathematical representation of shape and size, and finding a relationship between the two. Elliptical Fourier analysis is applied to stone tool contours in order to extract shape information, and then a series of regressions of shape on size provide trajectory vectors. The angles between these are then calculated and subjected to a variety of multivariate statistical tests. A case study involving several European Middle Paleolithic bifacial and unifacial tool assemblages is presented. The results show that resharpening and maintenance can be independent of morphology and technology, suggesting that there are strong grounds for focusing on functional systematics separately. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The majority of these points were collected from the pampas region of Argentina, Uruguay, central Chile, and southern Patagonia. These artifacts are defined by a convex blade, rounded shoulders, slightly concave stem sides, concave base, and occasional fluting on one or both faces. The presence of fluting and the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene chronological assignment have been proposed as evidence in support of a cultural relationship between these points and the early points of North America. To explore projectile point shape and related size variation in a quantitative way, we applied geometric morphometric techniques over a sample of 24 Fishtail points from Uruguay. The major trends of shape variation were tested against metric attributes, geographical provenance, and lithic raw material type. Results suggest no relationships between geographical provenance or lithic raw material type and shape variation. However, a significant correlation between size and shape was observed, which indicates an allometric relationship. Finally, we discuss some implications of these results in terms of the design and life history of projectile points and their relationship with the hunter-gatherer technology of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene.

Thus, exploring variability on the original designs can be informative of cultural adaptive processes on past populations. However, the complex life-cycle of a stone tool includes loops of damage due to use followed by breakage and resharpening that dramatically blur the size and shape attributes defining the original design. Here we use the Factor Model, a statistical approach recently modified to be used in landmark data, to evaluate original design attributes versus changes attributed to maintenance activities on a sample of Southern Patagonia lithic stemmed points, including arrows and spears. The model enables the separation of shape aspects that tend to covary because of common factors affecting simultaneously the two fundamental modules of a classical stemmed weapon (blade/stem), from those shape features explained only by local factors affecting modules independently. Our results show that original design differences explain most of the total shape variation, and also indicate that maintenance patterns differ among point types considered as different weapon systems (arrows and spears). Whereas arrow reduction is focused on tip modifications, spears present a broader array of shape changes including the tip and the shoulders. These results demonstrate that disentangling the sophisticated interaction among original design and maintenance activities of lithic projectile points enables a proper and independent exploration of adaptation to functional demands and cognitive models of past populations.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Factor model; Geometric morphometrics; Lithic projectile points; Shape variation","factor analysis; lithic fragment; modeling; morphometry; tool use; design; geometry; numerical model; shape; statistical analysis; weapon; Patagonia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884376430

This is an especially useful approach for high-dimensional (multivariate) data. Here, we present an r package that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for applying RRPP to linear models. Important available features include choices for OLS or GLS coefficient estimation, data or dissimilarity matrix analysis capability, choice among types I, II, or III sums of squares and cross-products, various effect size estimation methods, and an ability to perform mixed-model ANOVA. The lm.rrpp function is similar to the lm function in many regards, but provides coefficient and ANOVA statistics estimates over many random permutations. The S3 generic functions commonly used with lm also work with lm.rrpp. Additionally, a pairwise function provides statistical tests for comparisons of least-squares means or slopes, among designated groups. Users have many options for varying random permutations. Compared to similar available packages and functions, RRPP is extremely fast and yields comprehensive results for downstream analyses and graphics, following model fits with lm.rrpp. The RRPP package facilitates analysis of both univariate and multivariate response data, even when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. © 2018 The Authors.

For Clovis peoples, the earliest well-documented North Americans, resharpening is believed to have been particularly important because foraging territories were unknown or poorly known. Gardner (1983, Archaeol East N Amer 11, 49-64) proposed a spatial model of Clovis point resharpening wherein the effects of resharpening increase with distance from stone outcrop. Here we report a study that quantitatively assesses Gardner's model using a large sample of Clovis points from three high-quality chert sources in the Midwest. To investigate the predictions of the model, we used least-cost pathway distances from outcrop locations to each Clovis point and three measures of point resharpening. Our expectations, derived from the model, are that as distance from outcrop increases, points should show evidence of increased resharpening and therefore be smaller in size; should deviate from the classic shape; and should exhibit greater outer-to-inner flake-scar ratios. Our results indicate that there is no spatial patterning of these three measures of point resharpening and therefore do not support Gardner's model. Further analyses suggest that resharpening was not a significant source of Clovis-point variation at the population level and that Clovis points in the Midwest may not have served as the long-life tools as has been generally assumed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Clovis; Flake-scar pattern; Geometric morphometrics; Great Lakes; Least-cost pathway; Resharpening",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929612436

The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for two-rowed barley is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of two-rowed barley in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1st to the 11th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Archaeobotany; Cereal grains; Experimental charring; Identification; Medieval period; Roman period","agricultural history; archaeological evidence; archaeology; barley; cultivation; experimental study; identification method; Medieval; morphometry; Roman era; agriculture; botany; cereal; France; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886302631

Comparing the archaeological record with extractive foraging behaviors in nonhuman primates has focused on percussive implements as a key to investigating the origins of lithic technology. Despite this, archaeological approaches towards percussive tools have been obscured by a lack of standardized methodologies. Central to this issue have been the use of qualitative, non-diagnostic techniques to identify percussive tools from archaeological contexts. Here we describe a new morphometric method for distinguishing anthropogenically-generated damage patterns on percussive tools from naturally damaged river cobbles. We employ a geomatic approach through the use of three-dimensional scanning and geographical information systems software to statistically quantify the identification process in percussive technology research. This will strengthen current technological analyses of percussive tools in archaeological frameworks and open new avenues for translating behavioral inferences of early hominins from percussive damage patterns. © 2014 Caruana et al.",,"Article; artifact; computer program; controlled study; geographic information system; Hot Spot analysis; morphometrics; percussive technology; quantitative analysis; rank sum test; statistical analysis; three dimensional imaging; animal; animal behavior; fossil; physiology; primate; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Fossils; Primates",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84912084301

To date, the arguments presented have either been based on qualitative analyses of the cores or on the use of ratios of linear measurements to infer the shape of the detached flakes. This paper presents the results of applying 2D geometric morphometric analysis to the flake assemblages in the archaeological collections from the O and M levels of the Abric Romaní rock-shelter and from materials produced by experimental knapping. The results reveal a pattern of core configuration in the Levallois artefacts from level O and a high level of morphological correspondence between the core-edge flake outlines in discoid and Levallois recurrent centripetal technologies. This evidence reinforces the hypothesis that the discoid and the Levallois recurrent centripetal methods share some techno-morphological features. The knappers' ability and the purposes of the reduction sequences play important roles in metrically differentiating between them, otherwise the differences between the two methods would be even smaller. The use of geometric morphometric analysis of flake assemblages can enhance discussions of flaking technologies in lithic studies and quantitatively improve our understanding of the patterns of core configuration and the skills of the prehistoric knappers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Discoid technology; Geometric morphometric analysis; Levallois technology; Lithic technology; Middle Paleolithic","archaeology; artifact; morphometry; Paleolithic; shelter; Discoidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84909641618

Variation in point form represented by most of the assemblages, including the Plainview and Milnesand type assemblages, overlaps to a significant degree.

These techniques are hence inappropriate for any application regarding which we have a-priori biological knowledge to the contrary (e.g., genetic/morphogenetic processes common to multiple landmarks, the range of normal in anatomy atlases, the consequences of growth or function for form). But nearly every morphometric investigation is motivated by prior insights of this sort. We therefore need new tools that explicitly incorporate these elements of knowledge, should they be quantitative, to break the symmetries of the classic morphometric approaches. Some of these are already available in our literature but deserve to be known more widely: deflated (spatially adaptive) reference distributions of Procrustes coordinates, Sewall Wright’s century-old variant of factor analysis, the geometric algebra of importing explicit biomechanical formulas into Procrustes space. Other methods, not yet fully formulated, might involve parameterized models for strain in idealized forms under load, principled approaches to the separation of functional from Brownian aspects of shape variation over time, and, in general, a better understanding of how the formalism of landmarks interacts with the many other approaches to quantification of anatomy. To more powerfully organize inferences from the high-dimensional measurements that characterize so much of today’s organismal biology, tomorrow’s toolkit must rely neither on principal component analysis nor on the Procrustes distance formula, but instead on sound prior biological knowledge as expressed in formulas whose coefficients are not all the same.

Sixty-three fluted bifaces from eastern North America and fourteen replicate Clovis points are analyzed. Discriminant analysis shows that 3D model-based Fourier descriptors of flake scar contours are less successful than traditional metrics in correctly differentiating styles, but more successful in identifying individual knappers. Changes in the symmetry of front and back flake scars between Clovis and later fluted point styles indicate a possible shift in reduction techniques.

In order to address this, the current study uses a cross-cultural comparison. Adult subjects in two countries (Austria and Ethiopia, n=129) were asked to rate person characteristics of 46 standardized front views of automobiles on various trait scales. These two countries differ substantially with regard to their experience with car models and brands, as well as car marketing and media coverage. Geometric morphometrics was then used to assess the shape information underlying trait attribution. Car shapes for perceived maturity, maleness and dominance were highly similar in both countries, with patterns comparable to shape changes during facial growth in humans: Relative sizes of the forehead and windshield decrease with age/growth, eyes and headlights both become more slit-like, noses and grilles bigger, lips and air-intakes are wider. Austrian participants further attributed various degrees of some interpersonal attitudes and emotions, whereas neither Austrians nor Ethiopians congruently ascribed personalities. Morphological correlates of personal characteristics are discussed, as are person perception and its overgeneralization to inanimate objects.

Although represented in only a handful of sites, the Still Bay is widespread geographically and, at certain localities, persisted over a substantial period of time. Many studies have focused on tracing the temporal range and geographic reach of the Still Bay, as well as inferring degrees of early modern human demographic connectedness from these parameters. Variation within the Still Bay, relative to the accuracy with which it can be identified, has received considerably less attention. However, demographic models based on the spread of the Still Bay in space and time hinge on the reliability with which it can be recognized in the archaeological record. Here we document patterns of bifacial point shape and size variation in some key Still Bay assemblages, and analyse these patterns using the statistical shape analysis tools of geometric morphometrics. Morphological variation appears to be geographically structured and is driven by the spatial separation between north-eastern and south-western clusters of sites. We argue that allometric variation is labile and reflects environmentally driven differences in point reduction, whereas shape differences unrelated to size more closely reflect technological and cultural fragmentation. Our results suggest that the biogeographic structure of Middle Stone Age populations was complex during the period associated with the Still Bay, and provide little support for heightened levels of cultural interconnectedness between distantly separated groups at this time. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for tracing classic techno-traditions in the Middle Stone Age record of southern Africa, and for inferring underpinning population dynamics from these patterns. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bifacial points; Cultural connectedness and fragmentation; Geographic variation; Geometric morphometrics; Modern human demography; Techno-traditions","archaeology; biogeography; demography; geographical variation; Mesolithic; morphometry; shape analysis; South Africa; Still Bay; Western Cape; archeology; evolution; human; population dynamics; South Africa; technology; Archaeology; Biological Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; South Africa; Technology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974593556

The present work seeks to fill this gap, using as a case study a corpus of 154 complete ceramic vessels from the Bibracte oppidum (France), the capital of the Celtic tribe Aedui from the Second Iron Age. Two outline-based approaches were selected: the Elliptic Fourier Analysis and the Discrete Cosine Transform. They were combined with numerous methods of standardisation/normalisation. Although standardisations may use either perimeter or surface, the resulting morphospaces remain comparable, and, interestingly, are also comparable with the morphospace built from traditional typology. Geometric morphometrics also presentthe advantage of being easily implemented and automated for large sets of artefacts. The method is reproducible and provides quantitative estimates, such as mean shape, and shape diversity of ceramic assemblages, allowing objective inferences to be statistically tested. The approach can easily be generalised and adopted for other kinds of artefacts, to study the level of production standardisation and the evolution of shape over space and time, and to provide information about material and cultural exchanges. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeology; Bibracte; Closed contour; Discrete cosine transform; Elliptic fourier analysis; Open contour; Pottery; Type","archaeology; artifact; ceramics; Iron Age; morphometry; Fourier transform; geometry; standardization; strength; typology; France",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904340280

Here, we review and synthesize a range of recent work that we have undertaken on the issue of Levallois, with the aim of further considering its implications in terms of social learning during the Palaeolithic. Specifically, our recent experimental work has provided evidence that Levallois reduction supplied flakes that have predictable benefits from a functional perspective, and also supported an hypothesis that it has benefits relating to raw material economy. Geometric morphometric analyses of archaeological cores have, meanwhile, demonstrated that examples conforming to “classic” (lineal) Levallois form have certain geometric properties that display limited variation, even across wide geographic regions. Hence, replicating this morphology consistently may have demanded specific requirements on the part of individual knappers in order to procure its potential benefits. Given these findings, it may be important to ask whether replication of “Levallois” industries involved social transmission mechanisms beyond those used by populations producing earlier forms of stone tools. Drawing on findings from the literature on social learning, we outline a series of factors that suggest this to be the case. Although independent tests of this hypothesis are required, within the context of Lower-Middle Palaeolithic industries, Levallois reduction stands out as a candidate potentially requiring active instruction (i.e., teaching) for effective cultural replication. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Knapping costs; Levallois; Social learning",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978492594

Numerous innovations have improved the acoustical properties and payability of violins. Yet, other attributes of the violin affect its performance less, and with fewer constraints, are potentially more sensitive to historical vagaries unrelated to quality. Although the coarse shape of violins is integral to their design, details of the body outline can vary without significantly compromising sound quality. What can violin shapes tell us about their makers and history, including the degree that luthiers have influenced each other and the evolution of complex morphologies over time? Here, I provide an analysis of morphological evolution in the violin family, sampling the body shapes of over 9,000 instruments over 400 years of history. Specific shape attributes, which discriminate instruments produced by different luthiers, strongly correlate with historical time. Linear discriminant analysis reveals luthiers who likely copied the outlines of their instruments from others, which historical accounts corroborate. Clustering of averaged violin shapes places luthiers into four major groups, demonstrating a handful of discrete shapes predominate in most instruments. Violin shapes originating from multi-generational luthier families tend to cluster together, and familial origin is a significant explanatory factor of violin shape. Together, the analysis of four centuries of violin shapes demonstrates not only the influence of history and time leading to the modern violin, but widespread imitation and the transmission of design by human relatedness. © 2014 Daniel H.

In different regions, they are known by different labels (e.g. Bromme points, Lyngby points, and Teyjat points) and are often given culturally and hence chronologically diagnostic status as important fossiles directeurs, especially in northern Europe. The vast majority of these finds are from the surface or derive from less-than-secure contexts. Several recent papers have cast doubt on the validity of this artefact class as a taxonomically sensitive marker. Here, we further investigate this issue using 2D geometric morphometric techniques on a sample of published large tanged points from several key sites in northern Europe. This analysis reveals a substantial amount of shape variation within this artefact class and finds no support for distinctions between large tanged points derived from different cultural and/or chronological contexts. Our analysis thus strongly supports the notion that large tanged points do not function as useful culturally diagnostic marker artefacts. The earliest occurrences of Final Palaeolithic large tanged points date to late GS-2 or GI-1e (~. 15,000-14,000 cal BP), alongside arch-backed points. Their presence in later assemblages and technocomplexes such as the Brommean cannot therefore be considered as a derived or diagnostic feature. We suggest that this artefact class should rather be linked to weapon systems function (dart-points) different from the coeval arch-backed points (arrowheads) and that definitions of cultures based on these should thus be taken up for critical revision. © 2016 The Authors.","Bromme culture; Final Palaeolithic; Geometric morphometrics; Large tanged points; Projectile points",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979026037

The geometric morphometric analysis here takes outline data from a previously studied collection of projectile points and uses elliptical Fourier harmonics analysis combined with principal components and discriminant functions tests to objectively define and separate the two types of projectile point. The result is a bimodal distribution of types that conforms to the traditional typological classification system for the region, in contrast to recent scholarship that conflates the two types into one. This study describes a high-resolution technique that offsets the inherent drawbacks of subjective, coarse-grained measurement approaches to projectile point characterization and comments on the study of typology as a whole. © 2015.","Geometric morphometrics; Late Woodland Period; Measurement theory; Northeastern North America; Triangle points; Typology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944727062

Ritchie’s A Typology and Nomenclature of New York State Projectile Points remains an influential resource for archaeologists working in the northeastern US. Ritchie examined a large and diverse sample of stone projectile points, but not all fit neatly into his typology. In this chapter, we propose that alternative approaches afforded by computer vision and morphometrics can shed light on this and other problems of traditional stone tool typology. With the advent of computer vision, we can now examine the entire morphological continuum of projectile points through statistical shape analysis. Following automated image capture, three analytical methods were evaluated using silhouette, outline, and landmark data. Biased free capture methods to record the form of an individual projectile point, together with using invariant shape descriptors to quantify the data, may result in more objective analysis than was possible in the past. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971338514

Differences in the shapes and sizes of stone flakes—the most abundant remains of past behaviours for much of human evolutionary history—may be underpinned by variation in a range of different environmental and behavioural factors. Controlled flake production experiments have drawn inferences between flake platform preparation behaviours, which have thus far been approximated by linear measurements, and different aspects of overall stone flake variability (Dibble and Rezek J Archaeol Sci 36:1945–1954, 2009; Lin et al. Am Antiq 724–745, 2013; Magnani et al. J Archaeol Sci 46:37–49, 2014; Rezek et al. J Archaeol Sci 38:1346–1359, 2011). However, when the results are applied to archaeological assemblages, there remains a substantial amount of unexplained variability. It is unclear whether this disparity between explanatory models and archaeological data is a result of measurement error on certain key variables, whether traditional analyses are somehow a general limiting factor, or whether there are additional flake shape and size drivers that remain unaccounted for. To try and circumvent these issues, here, we describe a shape analysis approach to assessing stone flake variability including a newly developed three-dimensional geometric morphometric method (‘3DGM’). We use 3DGM to demonstrate that a relationship between platform and flake body governs flake shape and size variability. Contingently, we show that by using this 3DGM approach, we can use flake platform attributes to both (1) make fairly accurate stone flake size predictions and (2) make relatively detailed predictions of stone flake shape. Whether conscious or instinctive, an understanding of this geometric relationship would have been critical to past knappers effectively controlling the production of desired stone flakes. However, despite being able to holistically and accurately incorporate three-dimensional flake variance into our analyses, the behavioural drivers of this variance remain elusive. © 2017, The Author(s).","Stone flake shape and size predictions; Three-dimensional geometric morphometrics",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041587804

The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies. © 2017","Evolutionary Archaeology; Geometric Morphometrics; Interdisciplinarity; Stone tools","archaeology; evolutionary biology; geometry; interdisciplinary approach; ontogeny; phylogenetics; tool use",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046166965

Many types of axe have been identified, some of which have numerous variant forms. In the current French terminology, all axes are divided into two generic groups: namely ""Atlantic"" (Atlantique) and ""Eastern"" (Orientale). Each of these generic groups, however, is highly polymorphic, so that it is often very difficult for the operator to classify individual axes with absolute confidence and certainty. In order to overcome such problems, a new shape classification is proposed, using morphometric analysis (Elliptic Fourier Analysis) followed by unsupervised model-based clustering and discriminant analysis, both based on Gaussian mixture modelling. Together, these methods produce a clearer pattern, which is independently validated by the spatial distribution of the findings, and multinomial scan statistics. This approach is fast, reproducible, and operator-independent, allowing artefacts of unknown membership to be classified rapidly. The method is designed to be amendable by the introduction of new artefacts, in the light of future discoveries. This method can be adapted to suit many other archaeological artefacts, providing information about the material, social and cultural relations of ancient populations. © 2015.","Archaeology; Bronze age; Closed contour; Elliptic fourier analysis; Flanged axes; Gaussian mixture modelling; Morphometrics; Self-organizing maps; Typology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936875682

Evolution involves transmission, be it of genes, ideas, or designs. What is transmitted, how and by whom, influences tempo and mode of evolution. In recent years, archeologists have applied evolutionary logic and processes to their study of things made and used by ancient people. Despite differences in subject units and in modes and patterns of transmission, evolutionary processes and the transmission modes that accompany them are worth seeking in archeological data. Stone spear points are abundant in the archeological record, yet we lack a theory to explain the creation, duration, and divergence of point types. Evolutionary studies of New World Late Pleistocene Paleoindian points are a step toward such theory, but limit the form of data and the evolutionary processes considered. An alternative in the study of Paleoindian points is geometric morphometric methods that do not constrain how point size and form are characterized nor assume branching divergence between taxa.

Our research builds on such applications to examine the organization of production by applying GM analysis to whole ceramic vessels from the Casas Grandes culture of northwest Mexico. We quantify variation in vessel shape and size and conclude that specialists made at least some of the Ramos and Babicora Polychromes, but that the other Casas Grandes ceramic types were generally made by nonspecialists. This bolsters arguments for Medio period (AD 1200 to 1450) specialized production above the household level but indicates that specialized production was limited to a subset of economically valuable goods. We further suggest some Ramos Polychrome was made by attached specialists associated with elites at Paquime, the religious center of the Medio period, whereas some Babicora Polychrome was made by independent specialists. The analysis contributes to three important anthropological topics: (1) the study of the Medio period Casas Grandes culture, and by extension the organization of production in mid-level hierarchically organized societies; (2) geometric morphometric analysis of archaeological collections; and (3) the Standardization Hypothesis and the relationship between artifact standardization and the organization of production.
