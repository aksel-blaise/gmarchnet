As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

Among documented groups, a common response to such stress is temporary movement into adjacent occupied areas-moving in with ""relatives"" when things go wrong. However, in the case of early (ca. 12,000-10,000 B.P.) Paleoindian groups in the Americas, the availability of neighboring groups with a detailed knowledge of local resource geography could not be relied upon. Post-Pleistocene environmental changes and the low initial population of the New World are important factors conditioning a lifeway characterized by a dependence on hunting (though not exclusively of megafauna), and by high residential, logistical, and range (territorial) mobility. Early Paleoindian groups had to adopt a subsistence technology that could be employed regardless of the specific resource microstructure. In some regards, Paleoindians seem to have behaved like tropical foragers while in others like arctic collectors. Use of high quality lithic raw materials from large quarry sources, reliance on a bifacial technology, limited use of caves and rockshelters, and a low level of processing of food products for storage all may be indicative of such a subsistence technology, which would have been unlike that of any modern hunter-gatherers. © 1988 Society for American Archaeology.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019768854

Reliable systems are made so that they can be counted on to work when needed. Maintainable ones can easily be made to function if they are broken or not appropriate to the task at hand. Because these design alternatives have markedly different optimal applications and observably different physical characteristics, archaeologists can link the design of prehistoric weapons to environmental constraints and to specific hunting strategies.

Since that time the field of geometric morphometrics has matured into a rich and cohesive discipline for the study of shape variation and covariation. The development of the field is identified with the Procrustes paradigm, a methodological approach to shape analysis arising from the intersection of the statistical shape theory and analytical procedures for obtaining shape variables from landmark data. In this review we describe the Procrustes paradigm and the current methodological toolkit of geometric morphometrics. We highlight some of the theoretical advances that have occurred over the past ten years since our prior review (Adams et al., 2004), what types of anatomical structures are amenable to these approaches, and how they extend the reach of geometric morphometrics to more specialized applications for addressing particular biological hypotheses.

This hitherto under-emphasized point is the hub which best explains many questions. Low maritime cloud cover best accounts for today's tundra, and in a related way, the cloudy Polar Front accounts for the whole of the taiga. Even during Glacial maxima, the proximity of the sea to the Bering isthmus created intermittent maritime cloud cover. This regional cloud cover produced an ecological interruption, or buckle, of the arid steppe belt. While this Beringian mesic buckle did not serve as an intercontinental ecological barrier to most steppe-adapted species, it does seem to have limited the distributions of woolly rhinos, camels, American kiangs, short-faced bears, badgers, and some others. At the beginning of the Holocene, this narrow refugium seems to have been a source of some mesic-adapted species which colonized westward into the now tundra vegetation of northern Asia and eastward into northern North America. This Holocene expansion from a limited and regional Pleistocene refugium created our present misconceptions about Beringia.

Choices about the kinds of artifacts to carry around can be modeled as an optimization problem, in which it is beneficial to obtain the greatest potential utility for the minimum total weight. This study approaches the problem analytically, making a few simple assumptions about artifact geometry and the relations between utility and artifact size. If artifact utility is calculated as a function of potential for renewal, transported toolkits should consist entirely of relatively small finished tools. Moreover, most gains in durability or multifunctionality that require increases in overall size are outweighed by increased transport cost.

This paper argues that style is most profitably regarded as the ethnic idiom imparted to lithic technology in each and all of its aspects due to the culture-historical context of its manufacture and employment. Style is thus a full complement of function, and it is to be looked for wherever artisans encounter options of form and use to ""choose"" from in pursuing a given task. Because it equates ethnicity with functionally equivalent choice, this is labeled the isochrestic approach to style. Contrasted to this is the iconological approach, which restricts style solely to those aspects of formal variation that artisans purposefully invest with symbolic content reflecting self-conscious social groups. Pottery decoration appears to reveal such investment and therefore ceramic sociology is a feasible enterprise. However, a parallel iconological approach to stone tools is much less promising. At least as it is exemplified by the writings of Lewis Binford, lithic sociology would seem to have little substantive grounding in the relevant empirical data, to be argued within what may be an unsound theoretical frame (including the distinction between curative and expedient technologies), and in any case to resist translation into a workable analytic machinery. Not least among the reasons for this last is the fact that stone tools do not possess formal variation wherein iconologically significant investment can be objectively identified and defined. The archaeological frame of reference within which the isochrestic and iconological approaches are discussed is largely contributed by the classic Paleolithic sequence of the Perigord region of southwestern France. © 1982.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002922342

However, the effects of this process on the archaeological record have been virtually ignored. Hafting affects the final typological form of tools because hafted tools are usually more extensively and intensively worked than their unha/ted counterparts. Ethnoarchaeological and some recent archaeological evidence indicates that functionally equivalent but typologically diverse hafted and unha/ted tools may be in use at the same site. Because ha/ted tools are disposed of as a consequence of the ""retooling"" of hafts, the context of their disposal may not be equivalent to the context of their use. But, unha/ted tools appear to be disposed of more often at or near the focus of use. Indifference to the ha/ted/unha/ted distinction then may seriously distort inferences based upon intrasite spatial analysis. It is also argued that ha/ting is a strategy that will be di//erentially employed by any social group at different sites according to circumstances, thereby contributing to interassemblage variability. Finally, some methods o/analysis are suggested that will allow the typological and distributional effects of ha/ting and retooling to be taken into account by lithic analysts.

Major plant taxa behaved independently over time, resulting in substantial differences in the vegetation history of eastern and western regions. Major vegetation changes are in general agreement with GCM simulations and confirm the importance of the continental ice sheet and insolation variations in determining late Quaternary climatic trends. Herb-dominated tundra characterized the vegetation between 18 and 14 ka BP, with mesic graminoid tundra in lower elevations of western areas and more xeric, sparse tundra communities in the east and at higher elevations. Moist Betula tussock tundra rapidly replaced the western herb tundra ca. 14 ka BP. However, Betula shrubs expanded more slowly in the east, establishing relatively dry shrub tundra as the predominant regional vegetation by ca. 12 ka BP. River valleys and south-facing slopes supported Populus woodlands between 11 and 9 ka BP, but shrub tundra continued to dominate most upland sites. Alnus shrubs first expanded in the southwestern Brooks Range between 10 and 9 ka BP, spreading rapidly throughout the entire region between 8 and 7 ka BP. Picea glauca populations also expanded between 10 and 9 ka BP, but from source areas in northwestern Canada. The P. glauca forests were most abundant in riparian settings, but isolated stands probably also established in the shrub tundra. P. glauca reached the central Brooks Range by ca. 8 ka BP, followed by an apparent population decline between 8 and 7 ka BP. P. mariana became the dominant tree species ca. 6 ka BP, when it invaded non-riparian P. glauca forests in eastern and central areas and moist shrub tussock tundra in the west. The modern distribution of communities in northcentral Alaska was achieved between 6 and 4 ka BP. © 1994.",,"boreal forest; climatic trend; continental ice sheet; insolation variation; isochrone map; pollen analysis; Quaternary; tundra; vegetation change; vegetation history; USA, Alaska",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028160993

Although cladistically derived trees are only hypotheses about phylogeny, they are superior both to trees created through phenetics, which employs characters without regard as to whether they are analogous or homologous, and to trees created by using undifferentiated homologous characters. To date, cladistics is an unused approach to constructing archaeological phylogenies but one that holds considerable potential for resolving some of archaeology’s historical problems. For example, it has long been noted that the southeastern United States exhibits the greatest diversity in fluted-point forms in North America-an observation that prompted Mason (1962) to propose that fluted points originated in the Southeast and then spread to other areas. However, because of a paucity of such points from well-dated contexts in the Southeast, it is difficult to ascertain chronological, let alone phylogenetic, relations among the various forms. Evolutionary trees derived from cladistical analysis are testable hypotheses about those phylogenetic relations. © 2001 Academi Press.","Cladistics; Cultural transmission; Derived characters; Phylogenetic trees","archaeological evidence; cladistics; material culture; phylogeny; trade flow; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034793362

The predicted modern distribution of tundra, taiga and cool conifer forests in Alaska and north-western Canada generally corresponds well to actual vegetation patterns, although sites in regions characterized today by a mosaic of forest and tundra vegetation tend to be preferentially assigned to tundra. Siberian larch forests are delimited less well, probably due to the extreme under-representation of Larix in pollen spectra. The biome distribution across Beringia at 6000 14C yr BP was broadly similar to today, with little change in the northern forest limit, except for a possible northward-advance in the Mackenzie delta region. The western forest limit in Alaska was probably east of its modern position. At 18,000 14C yr BP the whole of Beringia was covered by tundra.

The results of this analysis indicate gradual, progressive changes in fluted point outline shape from the Great Plains of western North America into adjacent parts of North America as well as into Central and South America. The South American ""Fishtail"" form of fluted point is seen as the culmination of incremental changes in point shape that began well into North America. A geographically gradual decline in fluting frequency also is consistent with the stylistic evolution of the stemmed ""Fishtail"" points. Although few in number, the available radiocarbon dates do suggest that ""Fishtail"" fluted points in southern South America are younger than the earliest dates associated with Clovis points in western North America. All of these data converge on the conclusion that South American ""Fishtail"" points evolved from North American fluted points.

However, these studies lack a unified body of theory that might help to integrate their diverse perspectives. This paper expands recent anthropological discussions of risk as the basis for such a theory. We begin by defining risk, emphasizing two distinct components of this concept-the probability that some problem will occur and the cost of such an occurrenceand argue that technology can be seen as a means of reducing such probabilities in the face of unacceptably high costs. We support this argument using cross-cultural data on hunter-gatherer technology and archaeological and historic data on the construction of defensive works on the northern Great Plains. Next, we consider specific problems in applying this perspective archaeologically, concluding that existing limits on our ability to estimate failure probabilities and costs prevent us from testing the ideas outlined here in archaeological contexts. However, accepting this perspective as provisionally validated by ethnographic data allows us to see how it can illuminate archaeological cases, and we exemplify this by comparing the production of Araya microblade projectile points in the Japanese Paleolithic and Folsom fluted projectile points on the North American Great Plains. © 1997 Wiley Publisher.

Recent critiques have attempted to upend this position both empirically and theoretically, alternatively favoring a more generalized foraging economy. In this paper, the distinction between subsistence specialists and generalists is framed in terms of forager selectivity with regards to hunted prey, following a behavioral ecological framework. Faunal data are compiled from 33 Clovis sites and used to test the two alternative diet-breadth hypotheses. The data support the older ""Clovis as specialist"" model, although some use of small game is apparent. Furthermore, data from modern hunter-gatherers are marshaled to support the theoretical plausibility of specialized large-mammal hunting across North America during the Late Pleistocene.

Related to this problem is the absence of a robust statistical technique for comparing variation between different kinds of assemblages. This paper addresses these issues. The Weber fraction for line-length estimation describes the minimum difference that humans can perceive through unaided visual inspection. This value is used to derive a constant for the coefficient of variation (CV = 1.7 percent) that represents the highest degree of standardization attainable through manual human production of artifacts. Random data are used to define a second constant for the coefficient of variation that represents variation expected when production is random (CV = 57.7 percent). These two constants can be used to assess the degree of standardization in artifact assemblages regardless of kind. Our analysis further demonstrates that CV is an excellent measure of standardization and provides a robust statistical technique for comparing standardization in samples of artifacts.

There is widespread agreement that Clovis and related cultures of the Early Paleoindian period (∼11,500-10,500 BP) represent the first well-documented indications of human occupation, but considerable differences of opinion exist regarding the origins of these cultures. Here, we report the results of a study in which data from a continent-wide sample of Early Paleoindian projectile points were analyzed with cladistic methods in order to assess competing models of colonization as well as several alternative explanations for the variation among the points, including adaptation to local environmental circumstances, cultural diffusion, and site type effects. The analyses suggest that a rapidly migrating population produced the Early Paleoindian projectile point assemblages. They also suggest that the population in question is unlikely to have entered North America from either the Isthmus of Panama or the Midatlantic region. According to the analyses, the Early Paleoindians are more likely to have entered North America via either the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that is hypothesized to have opened around 12,000 BP, or the Northwest Coast. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Stratigraphic records of land-surface processes and vegetation change in the Arctic Foothills of northern Alaska reveal how tundra landscapes responded to climatic changes between 13,000 and 8000 14C yr BP. Peat deposition began and shrub vegetation became widespread ca. 12,500 14C yr BP, probably in response to the advent of warmer and wetter climate. Increased slope erosion caused rapid alluviation in valleys, and Populus trees spread northward along braided floodplains before 11,000 14C yr BP. Lake levels fell and streams incised their floodplains during the Younger Dryas (YD) (11,000-10,000 14C yr BP). A hiatus in records of Populus suggest that its geographic range contracted, and pollen records of other species suggest a cooler and drier climate during this interval. Basal peats dating to the YD are rare, suggesting that rates of paludification slowed. Immediately after 10,000 14Cyr BP, lake levels rose, streams aggraded rapidly again, intense solifluction occurred, and Populus re-invaded the area. Moist acidic tundra vegetation was widespread by 8500 14C yr BP along with wet, organic-rich soils. Most of these landscape-scale effects of climatic change involved changes in moisture. Although low temperature is the most conspicuous feature of arctic climate, shifts in effective moisture may be the proximate cause for many of the impacts that climate change has in arctic regions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

When possible, one makes repeated measurements on a set of individuals to calculate the relative variability of the test with the understanding that a reliable clinical test should give similar results when repeated on the same patient. There are times, however, when repeated measurements on the same patient are not possible. Under these circumstances, to combine results from different clinical trials or test sites, it is necessary to compare the coefficients of variation of several clinical trials. Using the work of Miller, we develop a general statistic for testing the hypothesis that the coefficients of variation are the same for k populations, with unequal sample sizes. This statistic is invariant under the choice of the order of the populations, and is asymptotically χ2. We provide an example using data from Yang and HayGlass.

The number of potential variables involved, including raw-material quality and abundance as well as individual movement and technological decisions, makes it extremely difficult to analyze mobility independent of all other influences. This papers develops a formal model of forager mobility, based on a well-known stochastic process termed a Lévy random walk. When combined with neutral assumptions about how stone is procured and used, the model may be used to recover detailed quantitative information about the organization of forager mobility from raw-material transport distances. The model has clear behavioral interpretations in terms of levels of planning, risk sensitivity, and time-energy optimization and thus provides several potential currencies for comparative studies of prehistoric mobility strategies. How other behavioral decisions such as raw-material selectivity and even social exchange of raw material might influence patterns of stone raw-material transport is also explored. © 2006 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

The technological approaches range from time-minimization tactics to resource-maximization tactics. Time-minimization tactics favor the intense curation of extractive tools and the expedient use of maintenance tools, while resource-maximization tactics employ a more rapid replacement of extractive tools coupled with intense curation of maintenance tools. Time-minimization tactics occur with lower risk wetter conditions and the selection of larger animals for prey, while resource-maximization tactics correspond to higher risk conditions during drier periods and the more intensive exploitation of smaller animals.

A newly developed digitizing method is used to capture 12 interlandmark characters from coordinate data to describe point form. Principal components analysis is used to investigate size and shape variation in point form, and the symmetry and allometry of characters are used to explore the effects of resharpening on point dimensions. Size allometry illustrates the degree of association of relative point proportions, and other aspects of point form, with point size. Blade length, the leading edge of the weapon, was found to be isometric with point size, suggesting that this character was critical to the proper functioning of weapon tips. The regulation of blade length to point size supports a fixed-in-haft model for Folsom point resharpening. Multivariate analyses show that reduction in point forms do not correlate with distance-to-source but are more consistent with the model of the cyclical resharpening and replacement of points. This research illustrates that multivariate and allometric analyses are useful methods for investigating models of technological organization and the effects of resharpening on point form. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

While several attributes usually help define a "" type,"" shape is invariably the most important. Here I report on a study that uses landmark-based geometric morphometrics to better define three Paleoindian point types from Florida: Suwannees, Simpsons, and Transitional Side Notched. Bilaterally symmetric specimens were created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating the types. The results show that the base configurations were best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife allocation tests. The entire point shape was less robust due to the variability in blade shape. The study demonstrates that the three point types can be rigorously defined in ways that are usable in daily archaeological practice, and that base shape, rather than the entire shape, is a better discriminator. Further, the study demonstrates the utility of using several freeware programs for processing and analyzing shape data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Geometric morphometrics; Hafting; Landmarks; Paleoindian; Symmetry; Typology","archaeology; artifact; geometry; morphometry; symmetry; typology; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857117297

The symmetrical, bifluted form allowed a split, facial-contact haft to extend nearly to the tip, thereby controlling both location and extent of fracture and allowing many cycles of point reworking. Extreme thinnes achieved by fluting facilitated leading edge sharpness for enhanced penetration. The near-constant cross-section from tip to base meant no loss of leading edge acuteness upon resharpening and inter-changeability of broken segments. The high-friction, forwardly adjustable haft assured firm mounting even with shortened, reused point segments. This efficient design was critical for groups who spent weeks and maybe months away from raw material sources in pursuit of game. Short, exhausted Folsom points or 'slugs' are what archaeologists most commonly find and study. In contrast, a quite long, fully fluted point made from a yet longer preform was the intended product of the Folsom knapper. The model presented here can be tested through study of preform length, finished point proportions, fracture patterns, haft element features, and use-wear analysis in archaeological specimens, as well as actualistic hunting experiments. The engine driving persistent use of snap blade, full fluted projectile technology was focused commitment to a single, highly mobile game species (bison). This specific technofunctional element in Folsom culture reveals a weapon system designed to mitigate against extreme risk regarding access to raw material. Continuing research should demonstrate that the appearance, geographic distribution, persistence, and disappearance of the Folsom fluted point relate closely to juxtapositions of climatic change, biotic change, and human population movements that occurred near the end of the Pleistocene.

All of these early assemblages are incorporated into an interval called the Beringian Period, at which time a land connection existed between Alaska and Siberia. A similar pattern is exhibited for assemblages dating between about 13,000 and 9500 calibrated years B.P.

Here we report a three-part study in which we investigated the transition using radiocarbon dates from Clovis and Folsom sites. In the first part of the study, we used dates from Folsom site-phases to determine when and where Folsom originated. In the second part of the study, we employed Clovis and Folsom dates in analyses designed to determine whether Folsom spread via demic diffusion or cultural diffusion. In the third part of the study we investigated the velocity of the Clovis-Folsom transition. The analyses suggest that Folsom first appeared around 12,800 calBP in the northern High Plains and spread north and south from there. They also suggest that the spread of Folsom was, at least in part, the result of population expansion. In addition, the analyses indicate that the spread of Folsom was relatively fast for a prehistoric diffusion but well below the maximum velocity that has been estimated for such events. These findings, in turn, have implications for the hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the Clovis-Folsom transition. They refute the idea that the Clovis-Folsom transition resulted from an extraterrestrial impact over northern North America at 12,900 ± 100 calBP but are consistent with the alternative proposal that the transition was a response to climate-driven environmental change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Clovis; Demic diffusion; Folsom; Paleoindian; Radiocarbon dates","archaeological evidence; cultural history; cultural tradition; environmental change; human settlement; Paleolithic; radiocarbon dating; spatiotemporal analysis; Great Plains",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955268294

However, the coefficients of variation presented a significant increase through time in three measurements related to projectile point neck and stem. The absence of change in shape might be related to small group size and low level of cultural innovation. Such cultural stability might be related to novelty-avoiding mechanisms or the operation of a meta-tradition that would be selected in very stable environments.

The study reported here evaluated this hypothesis with standard and geometric morphometric data recorded on Clovis and Folsom points from the Southern Plains and Southwest that are associated with mammoth or bison remains. Points used to hunt mammoth were found to be larger and of a different shape than points used to hunt bison, which supports the hypothesis. However, when both point type and prey size were taken into account, the results ran counter to predictions. Potential explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bison; Clovis; Folsom; Geometric morphometrics; Mammoth; Projectile points","archaeology; mammoth; morphometry; prey size; quantitative analysis; skeletal remains; Clovis [New Mexico]; New Mexico; United States; Bison",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251608170

In this paper, we present the first radiocarbon-dated centennial-scale stable water isotope record from permafrost in northern Alaska. This Late Glacial winter climate reconstruction from Barrow ice wedges demonstrates the existence of a Younger Dryas cold event, formerly believed to be reduced or absent in this area.

Central to the argument presented here is the quantification of projectile point manufacture based on the reconstruction of nodules. This methodology takes advantage of the archaeological visibility of Folsom point manufacture and offers an estimate of the number of points manufactured, even though these points might have been removed from the site by the prehistoric occupants. Results indicate that a minimum of 38 points was successfully manufactured at the site, while only three points were discarded there. This case exemplifies a gearing up situation in which weaponry is produced to anticipate needs, and demonstrates that Folsom technological organization integrates future-oriented decisions. Ultimately, the study illustrates how hunter-gatherer regional organization and long-term planning can be inferred from an individual locality through the identification of site-specific behavior and its integration into a broader perspective of human organization. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Location: North-eastern Siberia (Western Beringia), the Bering Land Bridge (Central Beringia), and Alaska and the Yukon Territory (Eastern Beringia). Methods: Analysis of habitat preferences of beetle species found in fossil assemblages, leading to classification of major habitat types characterized by the faunal assemblages. Results: Fossil beetle assemblages indicative of steppe-tundra are found mainly in the interior regions of Eastern Beringia, whereas these assemblages dominate nearly all late Pleistocene fossil sites in Western Beringia. Eastern Beringian faunas contain a much larger proportion of mesic to hygrophilous species and very few arid-habitat species. In contrast to this, the habitat requirements of the Western Beringian faunas are more evenly spread across the moisture spectrum. Main conclusions: The taxonomic patterns of the two sets of fossil assemblages are remarkably different. Eastern Beringian faunal assemblages contain substantial numbers of mesic tundra and riparian rove beetles (Staphylinidae); this element is almost entirely lacking in the Western Beringian fossil assemblages. Taphonomic bias tends to overemphasize moisture-loving species at the expense of dry, upland species in the fossil record. Both Western and Eastern Beringian landscapes undoubtedly contained mosaics of habitats ranging from dry uplands (steppe-tundra) through mesic tundra to bogs and riparian corridors.","Beringia; Insect fauna; Palaeoecology; Pleistocene; Steppe-tundra","beetle; fossil assemblage; Pleistocene; steppe; tundra; Canada; Russian Federation; United States; Coleoptera; Insecta; Riparia; Staphylinidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034446485

Palynology has been portrayed as a 'blunt' tool for reconstructing variations in arctic tundra vegetation. We tested this characterization in the Arctic Foothills of northern Alaska by analysing 56 modern pollen assemblages from lakes on contrasting glaciated surfaces. The two surfaces, which date to the Sagavanirktok (> 125 000 years BP) and Itkillik II (c. 11 500 years BP) ice advances from the Brooks Range, have considerably different geomorphology, soil characteristics and plant communities. Sagavanirktok surfaces are dominated by dwarf-shrub tundra (DST), and Itkillik II surfaces by prostrateshrub tundra (PST). 2. We used two multivariate approaches, dissimilarity metrics (squared chord distance and Canberra metric distance) and discriminant analysis, to assess the ability of the pollen data to distinguish between the Sagavanirktok and Itkillik II landscapes, and to identify the taxa most strongly associated with one surface or the other. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the dissimilarity metrics and to determine their 'critical values' for distinguishing between assemblages from like and unlike plant communities. 3. According to the discriminant analysis, taxa indicative of the Sagavanirktok surface include Rubus chamaemorus, Sphagnum and Ericales, whereas Equisetum, Thalictrum and Polypodiaceae were faithful to the Itkillik II surface. These differences between the pollen assemblages make it possible to differentiate between the two landscapes using Canberra metric distance comparisons. The ROC analysis demonstrated that the Canberra metric distance is more effective than squared chord distance for distinguishing between the two surfaces. This study illustrates that palynology can be used to explore questions regarding the landscape-scale heterogeneity of past tundra vegetation.","Alaska; Modern pollen; North Slope; Palaeoecology; Palynology","geomorphology; paleoecology; palynology; plant community; soil property; tundra; Alaska; Brooks Range; North America; United States; Equisetum; Ericales; Polypodiaceae; Rubus; Rubus chamaemorus; Sphagnum; Thalictrum",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347252323

Two contentious issues are the timing of colonization of the Bering Land Bridge and origin of Clovis, which at 13,000 calendar years ago is the earliest unequivocal complex of archaeological sites in temperate North America, known by its specialized fluted spear points. One hypothesis is that fluting technology emerged in Beringia and from there was carried southbound, with fluted points becoming the diagnostic ""calling card"" of early Paleoindians spreading across the Western Hemisphere. Fluted points have long been known from Alaska, yet until now they have never been found in a datable geologic context, making their relationship to Clovis a mystery. Here we show that a new archaeological site at Serpentine Hot Springs, Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, Alaska, contains fluted points in a stratified geologic deposit dating to no earlier than 12,400 calendar years ago. Our results suggest that Alaska's fluted-point complex is too young to be ancestral to Clovis, and that it instead represents either a south-to-north dispersal of early Americans or transmission of fluting technology from temperate North America. These results suggest that the peopling of the Americas and development of Paleoindian technology were much more complex than traditional models predict. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bering Land Bridge; Fluted points; Paleoindian technology; Peopling of the Americas","age determination; archaeological evidence; colonization; dating method; diaspora; Pleistocene; settlement history; Alaska; United States; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880823662

More recent studies challenge this view and indicate that the role of an extensive sea ice cover may have been as important in promoting abrupt climate change as reorganisations of the North Atlantic Ocean [Gildor, H., Tziperman, E., 2003. Sea-ice switches and abrupt climate change. Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society Of London Series A - Mathematical Physical And Engineering Sciences 361, 1935-1942]. Based on glacier evidence from eastern Greenland [Denton, G.H., Alley, R.B., Comer, G.C., Broecker, W.S., 2005. The role of seasonality in abrupt climate change. Quaternary Science Reviews 24, 1159-1182] suggest that the seasonal temperature amplitude increased by about 20°C during the Younger Dryas. Such a 'switching of seasonality' lends support to the idea of a fast-expanding sea ice cover, because it allows for extremely cold winters that are balanced by relatively mild summers. However, climatic interpretations based on the geometry and length of glaciers under such conditions as in Scoresby Sund is not well understood, and equilibrium-line- altitude (ELA) estimates should, therefore, be regarded as tentative. Here, we discuss the absolute seasonal amplitude during the Younger Dryas by taking winter precipitation into account and show that the changes in seasonality may have been limited to 10°C. We propose that by reducing the seasonal response in Greenland compared with western Europe we better understand the hinged-door modus operandi [COHMAP, 1988.

Because these artifacts were all likely made and cached approximately 13,000 years ago by one or a handful of knappers belonging to a single band with a shared Clovis cultural template, Hogeye provides a rare opportunity to investigate Clovis lithic reduction signatures. This paper builds on previous analyses and presents new methods for quantifying Clovis biface production signatures, including serial flaking and the timing of last overshot flaking. The results show that the Hogeye cache bifaces technologically and morphologically differ from other regional Clovis biface reduction signatures. Additional data is needed to determine whether these differences reflect individual knapping preferences or regional cultural signatures. The methods used and developed here are not Clovis-specific and could be modified and combined with other analytical techniques to identify reduction signatures in biface assemblages from other times and places. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Biface production; Cache caching; Clovis; Lithic technology; Paleoindian","archaeology; artifact; Holocene; indigenous population; technology; Texas; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867905839

In some regions of the Northern Hemisphere the Younger Dryas was not significantly felt; however, in far northern regions affects of climate change are often acute. This paper focuses on the central Alaskan record to explore human-environment interactions during the terminal Pleistocene and tackle questions regarding human response to the Younger Dryas. This region of Beringia preserves a wealth of both paleoecological and archaeological data. Relative to other northern landscapes, proxy data from central Alaska indicate the Younger Dryas signal was somewhat muted but still characterized by return to cooler and/or more arid conditions. This phenomenon likely affected distributions and character of both floral and faunal resources, altering human perception of the surrounding landscape and potentially leading to reorganization of technologies, subsistence behavior, and land-use strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeological evidence; climate effect; climate variation; human settlement; Northern Hemisphere; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; Younger Dryas; Alaska; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052407259

The FPt and ASTt are seen as residentially mobile groups with comparatively little reliance on food storage and minimal transportation aids. At the same time they also produced very similar flaked stone technologies that differed greatly from all later groups, being characterized by standardized core reduction, excellence in manufacture, production of a wide range of often hafted tools, use of the highest quality toolstones and a reliance on flaked stone, as opposed to ground stone, tools. The main advantage of these technologies is that they are not only flexible but can be rapidly produced. It is suggested that the key variable accounting for these choices is the lack of efficient transportation aids. In colonizing situations, the limited transport capabilities force populations to: (a) rely more on less predictable search and encounter methods of resource procurement and in turn, residential mobility to position people with regard to resources and (b) place a high premium on efficient time allocation to meet the excessive demands needed to maintain social contacts and mating networks amongst very low density populations. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Paleoindians were present during a time of rapid and sweeping changes in vegetation, slope erosion, floodplain dynamics, permafrost stability, and soil type. We speculate that Paleoindians moved into arctic Alaska to exploit population highs in large ungulates that in turn were triggered by landscape-scale, geomorphic disturbances caused by climate changes. Environmental changes slowed and rising sea levels flooded Alaska's continental shelves during the Early Holocene, causing summer temperatures to fall and precipitation to increase. A more stable climate and the prevalence of maritime air masses allowed the spread of tussock-tundra vegetation, which probably drove both the Paleoindians and their prey species out of the region.",,"Holocene; human settlement; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; sea level change; stratigraphy; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035782678

Since these physical properties are integrated to accomplish that function, examining design variables and their pattern of integration or modularity is of interest to estimate the past function of a point. Here we analyze a composite sample of lithic points from southern Patagonia likely formed by arrows, thrown spears and hand-held points to test if they can be viewed as a two-module system formed by the blade and the stem, and to evaluate the degree in which shape, size, asymmetry, blade: stem length ratio, and tip angle explain the observed variance and differentiation among points supposedly aimed to accomplish different functions. To do so we performed a geometric morphometric analysis on 118 lithic points, departing from 24 two-dimensional landmark and semi landmarks placed on the point's contour. Klingenberg's covariational modularity tests were used to evaluate different modularity hypotheses, and a composite PCA including shape, size, asymmetry, blade: stem length ratio, and tip angle was used to estimate the importance of each attribute to explaining variation patterns. Results show that the blade and the stem can be seen as ""near decomposable units"" in the points integrating the studied sample. However, this modular pattern changes after removing the effects of reduction. Indeed, a resharpened point tends to show a tip/rest of the point modular pattern. The composite PCA analyses evidenced three different patterns of morphometric attributes compatible with arrows, thrown spears, and hand-held tools. Interestingly, when analyzed independently, these groups show differences in their modular organization. Our results indicate that stone tools can be approached as flexible designs, characterized by a composite set of interacting morphometric attributes, and evolving on a modular way. © 2012 Gonzalez-Jose, Charlin.",,"Argentina; arrow; article; blade; Chile; lithic point weapon; morphometrics; prehistoric period; principal component analysis; sample; spear; stone tool; variance; weapon; History, Ancient; Humans; Principal Component Analysis; South America; Weapons",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867685134

Geoarchaeological research at Dog Creek sought to interpret site formation processes in order to understand the relationship between surficial artifacts, buried artifacts, and stratified sediments. It also attempted to reconstruct the periglacial processes that were active in transforming the site and their relationships to microclimatic conditions. Sedimentology and fabric analysis show that artifacts were buried by solifluction and disturbed by frost heave and cryoturbation. Radiocarbon dating and pollen analysis demonstrated that solifluction took place approximately 5200-2000 years ago when a spruce forest existed at the site. This evidence suggests an onset of cooling conditions that continues to the present.

Distinctive lanceolate bifacial points dominate these assemblages; variation in size, shape, production technique, and basal treatment of these points has led archaeologists to define three assemblage groups, the fluted-point, Mesa, and Sluiceway complexes. These projectile points were components of technological systems that emphasized high-quality lithic raw materials used in a formal bifacial industry. Scarce faunal remains and other evidence suggest a subsistence regime centered on the hunting of herd animals such as caribou and bison, and land-use patterns characterized by seasonally structured movements and high logistical mobility. Standardized wedge-shaped core and microblade technology has not been unequivocally tied to the Northern Paleoindian complexes, giving them a character different from most other early Beringian sites and more strongly suggesting a link to late-Pleistocene technocomplexes in the midcontinent. However, careful technological and morphometric studies are needed to assess the relationship of these early northern Beringian industries to those of like age in the temperate latitudes of North America. © 2014 by Kelly E.

So far, however, the impact of resharpening on the distinctiveness of the blades of Paleoindian projectile points has not been investigated quantitatively. With this in mind, we used geometric morphometric techniques to compare the blades of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points from the Southern Plains of North America. We evaluated two hypotheses. The first was that blade shape distinguishes the three types. We found that blade shape distinguished Clovis points from both Folsom and Plainview points, but did not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The second hypothesis we tested was that resharpening eliminates blade shape differences among the types. To test this hypothesis, we used size as a proxy for -resharpening. The results of this analysis were similar to those obtained in the first analysis. Thus, our study suggests that, contrary to what is often assumed, resharpening does not automatically undermine the use of blade shape in Paleoindian projectile point typologies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871436910

We examined morphological and behavioral plasticity induced by durophagy (consumption of hard foods) in red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), an ecologically and recreationally important fish species undergoing stock enhancement. At the conclusion of the experiment, we conducted feeding performance trials to address the potential adaptive significance of diet-induced traits. Relative to soft foods, hard food induced a deeper head in the area of the pharyngeal mill, anterio-dorsally shifted eyes, and 8% heavier feeding muscles in juvenile S. ocellatus. These fish initially consumed hard food 2.6 times faster than fish raised on soft food. However, in subsequent feeding trials, handling time rapidly converged until both groups appeared equally efficient. This result indicates that learning may compensate for small magnitude morphological differences within a species. We discuss the importance of performance trials for testing the adaptive significance of induced plasticity and the value of separating behavioral and morphological development in studies of phenotypic plasticity. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our results for successful supplementation of wild populations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To date, such estimates have been based largely on experimental replication and rarely on archaeological data, and it is suggested the experimental estimates are inaccurate. In order to overcome these problems, three interrelated, yet independent, methods of estimating fluting failure rates from archaeological data are developed and applied to data from the Parkhill site in Ontario and the Windy City site in Maine.

To do so, it explores the organization of weaponry production at a series of Folsom campsites via the highly visible archaeological signature of Folsom fluting. A model of weaponry replacement based on deep planning and anticipation of needs is proposed, according to which Folsom hunters commonly replace their projectile points as they wear down, break or are lost, but on fewer occasions engage in the mass production of fluted points. This technological organization is consistent with a highly mobile way of life in which advanced planning buffers the risk associated with limited or stochastic access to good quality lithic raw materials. The model is then put to the test at the Lindenmeier site in northern Colorado. The spatial patterning of fluting activities in two discrete areas of the site demonstrates contrasting strategies of point manufacture: conservation versus gearing up (creation of a surplus). It is argued that these patterns represent distinct facets of a single technological organization. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Anticipated mobility; Folsom; Lindenmeier site; Planning depth; Technological organization; Weaponry production",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880383363

While the theoretical landscape has changed drastically in the past century, lithic analysts have continued to use this methodological construct (Bleed 2001, 2002), particularly in the southeastern United States (Carr and Bradbury 2000:125- 126). Specifically, many studies of lithic technology, especially those geared toward the analysis of Paleoindian biface technology, have a tendency to view the lithic reduction process as occurring as a series of sequential stages proceeding toward an ideal form, a fluted point ready to be hafted (Callahan 1979; Morrow 1996; Sanders 1990; Whittaker 1994). However, in recent years many have argued for an alternative approach that views stone tool production as a continuous process (Amick 1985; Bleed 2002; Bradbury and Carr 1999; Carr and Bradbury 2000; Ingbar et al. 1989; Johnson 1989; Shott 1996a; Wilson and Andrefsky 2008). In this chapter, we attempt to identify evidence for discrete stages in the production of Paleoindian Clovis type bifaces from the Topper site (38AL23), a prehistoric chert quarry in Allendale County, South Carolina. We argue, as have others, that sequential stages may be arbitrary stops in what might otherwise be modeled as a continuous process. To illustrate this point, we conduct both technological and spatial analyses of a sample of Clovis bifaces, bifacial fragments, and overshot flakes. Our results indicate that biface production was technologically a continuous process consisting of multiple reduction trajectories. However, the result of our spatial analysis indicates that biface production was segmented across space, such that it may have been a staged process, which is different from previous models of Clovis biface manufacture. Finally, we discuss how analyses of biface production based on continuous variables, as opposed to stages, can be integrated with studies of cultural transmission and the organization of technology. © 2012 The University of Alabama Press.

In addition to artifacts of Paleoindian type, however, the Mesa site (type site of the Mesa complex) has a wedge-shaped core microblade technology, which is decidedly non-Paleoindian in character. Unfortunately, the Mesa is a shallow site, with no appreciable vertical structure or stratigraphic development. In essence, artifacts must be treated as if they were sitting on a single surface. This situation permits conflicting interpretations of the microblades and their relationship to the Paleoindian component. This paper presents a basic description of the microblades and associated artifacts at the Mesa site and the results of an analysis designed to discriminate these materials from the rest of the site assemblage. Using data on technology, raw material, and spatial patterning, I argue that the microblades and associated artifacts constitute a component that is distinct and separate from the Mesa Paleoindian component. The paper concludes with a discussion of several possible interpretations of the Mesa complex in light of these findings.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-60949218121

The potential importance of Putu cannot be disputed, for it also contains other technologies possibly Pleistocene in age, like blades and lanceolate points. This paper presents the results of a reanalysis of the artifact assemblage and its spatial context. The study shows that Putu probably contains at least three components: 1) a Mesa complex Paleoindian component dated to ca. 10,500 radiocarbon years B.P.; 2) a fluted point component, possibly associated with blades and, while essentially undated, very tentatively linked to dates of ca. 8,500 radiocarbon years B.P.; and 3) an historical era component. Making use of detailed provenience data from the original excavations, the reanalysis also demonstrates extensive post-depositional disturbance of the site, which places severe limits on the conclusions that can be drawn. As a result, interpretations of the site must be viewed with caution. © 2006 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.",,"archaeology; artifact; excavation; Pleistocene; spatial analysis; Alaska; North America; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748342709

Specific plant species rapidly peaked and declined, and in some cases, as with the poplar spread, the waxing and waning of these communities was unsynchronized across the landscape. Undoubtedly a similar dynamic would have characterized changes in animal populations as well, a point which is particularly relevant in the case of Alaska, since edible plants are rare in the northern latitudes and animals have always comprised the bulk of the human diet. The post- glacial world would have seen pronounced fluctuation in a variety of factors that would have impacted humans, including changes in the composition of plant and animal communities, variation in animal behavior due to habitat change, and fluctuation in moisture, which would have affected, among other things, lake levels and the availability of fish, migratory birds, and other game. In contrast to the terminal Pleistocene, the Early Holocene was marked by a gradual and cumulative or directional trend in environmental change, due to a cessation of the dramatic climatic fluctuation of the final millennia of the Pleistocene. The onset of the Holocene was marked by the appearance of several key species indicative of the boreal forest, and the first few millennia of the Holocene saw the development of modern forest and tundra communities. As often noted, in Alaska it is clear that the Pleistocene was a time of fine- grained environmental patchiness, with spatial and temporal variation in the appearance and disappearance of specific species and communities, while the Holocene has been one of stable, expansive, and rather homogenous environmental zones (the ""plaids"" and ""stripes"" of Guthrie [1984]). In Alaska, these Holocene ""stripes"" translate to: The boreal forest in the interior, arctic tundra to the north, moist tundra to the southwest, and temperate rainforest along the southern coast. Given these structurally and compositionally very different environmental settings, we might expect the Early Holocene archaeological record to differ markedly from the terminal Pleistocene record of Alaska, much as it does elsewhere in North America. This is not to say, of course, that the Holocene archaeological record should be static, for it clearly is not (see Holly 2002). However, the environmental backdrop against which Holocene events transpired surely impacted humans differently than did that of the preceding millennia.
