Data are represented by a mixture model in which each component corresponds to a different cluster. Models with varying geometric properties are obtained through Gaussian components with different parametrizations and cross-cluster constraints. Noise and outliers can be modelled by adding a Poisson process component. Partitions are determined by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes factor based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); unlike significance tests, this allows comparison of more than two models at the same time, and removes the restriction that the models compared be nested. The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering method are solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover, the EM result provides a measure of uncertainty about the associated classification of each data point. Examples are given, showing that this approach can give performance that is much better than standard procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping or of varying sizes and shapes.",,"Algorithms; Constraint theory; Data reduction; Mathematical models; Maximum likelihood estimation; Problem solving; Statistical methods; Bayesian information criterion (BIC); Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms; Model-based cluster analysis; Data structures",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032269108

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

Our study contrasts the effectiveness, in terms of power and type I error rates, of the Mantel test and PROTEST. We illustrate the application of Procrustes superimposition to visually examine the concordance of observations for each dimension separately and how to conduct hypothesis testing in which the association between two data sets is tested while controlling for the variation related to other sources of data. Our simulation results show that PROTEST is as powerful or more powerful than the Mantel test for detecting matrix association under a variety of possible scenarios. As a result of the increased power of PROTEST and the ability to assess the match for individual observations (not available with the Mantel test), biologists now have an additional and powerful analytical tool to study ecological and evolutionary relationships.","Mantel test; Matrix association; Multivariate analysis; Procrustes analysis; Randomization test","comparative study; multivariate analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034782527

Here, analysis of variation in seed morphology aims to provide accurate criteria for the discrimination between wild grapes and modern cultivars and to understand changes in functional traits in relation to the domestication process. This approach is also used to quantify the phenotypic diversity in the wild and cultivated compartments and to provide a starting point for comparing well-preserved archaeological material, in order to elucidate the history of grapevine varieties. METHODS: Geometrical analysis (elliptic Fourier transform method) was applied to grapevine seed outlines from modern wild individuals, cultivars and well-preserved archaeological material from southern France, dating back to the first to second centuries. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Significant relationships between seed shape and taxonomic status, geographical origin (country or region) of accessions and parentage of varieties are highlighted, as previously noted based on genetic approaches. The combination of the analysis of modern reference material and well-preserved archaeological seeds provides original data about the history of ancient cultivated forms, some of them morphologically close to the current 'Clairette' and 'Mondeuse blanche' cultivars. Archaeobiological records seem to confirm the complexity of human contact, exchanges and migrations which spread grapevine cultivation in Europe and in Mediterranean areas, and argue in favour of the existence of local domestication in the Languedoc (southern France) region during Antiquity.",,"article; Europe; evolution; Fourier analysis; genetics; grape; physiology; plant seed; prenatal development; Europe; Evolution; Fourier Analysis; Seeds; Vitis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952960951

They then spread across the Middle and Near East and westward into Europe alongside early agriculturalists. European pigs were either domesticated independently or more likely appeared so as a result of admixture between introduced pigs and European wild boar. As a result, European wild boar mtDNA lineages replaced Near Eastern/Anatolian mtDNA signatures in Europe and subsequently replaced indigenous domestic pig lineages in Anatolia. The specific details of these processes, however, remain unknown. To address questions related to early pig domestication, dispersal, and turnover in the Near East, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA and dental geometric morphometric variation in 393 ancient pig specimens representing 48 archeological sites (from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic to the Medieval period) from Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Our results reveal the first genetic signatures of early domestic pigs in the Near Eastern Neolithic core zone. We also demonstrate that these early pigs differed genetically from those in western Anatolia that were introduced to Europe during the Neolithic expansion. In addition, we present a significantly more refined chronology for the introduction of European domestic pigs into Asia Minor that took place during the Bronze Age, at least 900 years earlier than previously detected. By the 5th century AD, European signatures completely replaced the endemic lineages possibly coinciding with the widespread demographic and societal changes that occurred during the Anatolian Bronze and Iron Ages. © 2012 The Author 2012.

There is widespread agreement that Clovis and related cultures of the Early Paleoindian period (∼11,500-10,500 BP) represent the first well-documented indications of human occupation, but considerable differences of opinion exist regarding the origins of these cultures. Here, we report the results of a study in which data from a continent-wide sample of Early Paleoindian projectile points were analyzed with cladistic methods in order to assess competing models of colonization as well as several alternative explanations for the variation among the points, including adaptation to local environmental circumstances, cultural diffusion, and site type effects. The analyses suggest that a rapidly migrating population produced the Early Paleoindian projectile point assemblages. They also suggest that the population in question is unlikely to have entered North America from either the Isthmus of Panama or the Midatlantic region. According to the analyses, the Early Paleoindians are more likely to have entered North America via either the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that is hypothesized to have opened around 12,000 BP, or the Northwest Coast. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This methodological paper examines approaches to optimizing the classification of specimens based on their outlines. This study examines the performance of four approaches to the mathematical representation of outlines and two different approaches to curve measurement as applied to a collection of feather outlines. A new approach to the dimension reduction necessary to carry out a CVA on this type of outline data with modest sample sizes is also presented, and its performance is compared to two other approaches to dimension reduction. Results: Two semi-landmark-based methods, bending energy alignment and perpendicular projection, are shown to produce roughly equal rates of classification, as do elliptical Fourier methods and the extended eigenshape method of outline measurement. Rates of classification were not highly dependent on the number of points used to represent a curve or the manner in which those points were acquired. The new approach to dimensionality reduction, which utilizes a variable number of principal component (PC) axes, produced higher cross-validation assignment rates than either the standard approach of using a fixed number of PC axes or a partial least squares method. Conclusion: Classification of specimens based on feather shape was not highly dependent of the details of the method used to capture shape information. The choice of dimensionality reduction approach was more of a factor, and the cross validation rate of assignment may be optimized using the variable number of PC axes method presented herein. © 2006 Sheets et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749530871

However, the accuracy of these assessments has never been evaluated. Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes). Lastly, the absence of resharpening effects raises questions about the validity of the reduction thesis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A newly developed digitizing method is used to capture 12 interlandmark characters from coordinate data to describe point form. Principal components analysis is used to investigate size and shape variation in point form, and the symmetry and allometry of characters are used to explore the effects of resharpening on point dimensions. Size allometry illustrates the degree of association of relative point proportions, and other aspects of point form, with point size. Blade length, the leading edge of the weapon, was found to be isometric with point size, suggesting that this character was critical to the proper functioning of weapon tips. The regulation of blade length to point size supports a fixed-in-haft model for Folsom point resharpening. Multivariate analyses show that reduction in point forms do not correlate with distance-to-source but are more consistent with the model of the cyclical resharpening and replacement of points. This research illustrates that multivariate and allometric analyses are useful methods for investigating models of technological organization and the effects of resharpening on point form. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Elliptical Fourier functions are derived as a parametric formulation from conventional Fourier analysis, i.e., as a pair of equations that are functions of a third variable. The use of elliptical Fourier functions circumvents three restrictions that have limited conventional Fourier analysis to certain classes of shapes. These restrictions are (1) equal divisions over the interval or period; (2) dependency on the coordinate system, i.e., conventional Fourier functions are not “coordinate free”; and (3) the presence of shapes with outlines that curve back on themselves, a common occurrence. These three limitations are effectively removed with the utilization of elliptical Fourier functions, facilitating the analysis of a much larger class of two‐dimensional forms.

These descriptors are derived either from linear measurements or from outline analysis. The effects of these different descriptors on classical analysis as used in biology or palaeobiology are explored. First, the reliability of results in statistical classification is assessed. All of the descriptors discriminate well between the two species. The initial morphometric scheme (linear or outline) does not induce marked differences in statistical classification and the major discrepancies are between standardized and non-standardized versions of descriptors, and between amplitude- and coefficient-based or linear-based descriptors. Subsequently, the similarity of morphospaces based on partial least squares analysis and of intraspecific variance (estimated from the morphospace analysis) are observed. This is done within a morphospace-disparity framework and procedures used here for testing are directed at this research area. Similarities between morphospaces are relatively high. In this case, the initial morphometric scheme is a major factor inducing dissimilarity. However, the patterns of intraspecific dispersion inferred from morphospaces are roughly similar. Major differences in results correspond to the two classes of form or shape descriptors. Similarity of intraspecific variance is obtained when standardized descriptors are used (except for amplitude-based descriptors); conversely, dissimilarity is obtained when non-standardized descriptors are used. In many cases, the results of the various analyses are robust despite changes in descriptor. Moreover, the developmental pathway of vole teeth can frequently explain major dissimilarity or even similarity. © 2004 The Linnean Society of London.","Complex series; Elliptic series; Fourier; Linear measurements; Microtus; Multivariate analyses; Voles","dentition; morphometry; multivariate analysis; rodent; taxonomy; Microtus; Microtus agrestis; Microtus arvalis; Muridae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-6344239127

In order to assess whether the characters common to both sexes share the same phenotypic variability due to common genetic architecture, we compared males and females of the stag beetle Prosopocoilus inclinatus using recently developed geometric morphometric methods. Elliptic Fourier analysis was used to compare shape variation between male characters (including exaggerated mandibles) and developmentally homologous female characters. A significant positive correlation was found between the size or between the weight of different body parts in both sexes, but a conspicuous difference was detected in the frequency distribution of the weight of all the body parts. Elliptic Fourier analysis demonstrated that there was marked discontinuous variation in mandibles in males, whereas such a discontinuity was not clear in females. The shape of a character in males exhibited some similarity with that of other characters, but this was not found in females. In a character, growth trajectory of shape was significantly affected by both size and weight in males, whereas size and shape tended to vary independently in female characters. These results support the hypothesis that a large sexual dimorphism in variation in shape is due to alleles accumulating in tight linkage with a sex-determining gene. © 2004 The Linnean Society of London.","Elliptic Fourier analysis; Exaggerated character; Morphometrics; Multivariate allometry; Phenotypic variability; Stag beetle","allometry; beetle; morphometry; sexual dimorphism; Coleoptera; Lucanidae; Prosopocoilus inclinatus; Pseudolucanus capreolus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242300199

Two elements are involved: 1) elliptical Fourier functions (EFFs), to provide estimates of global aspects, and 2) continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) to generate an objective estimate of localized features. EFFs are computed, using a set of pseudohomologous points, to create a precise analog of the boundary. This computed contour is then normalized by scaling and rotated in two-dimensional space to insure a representation that is invariant with respect to starting point, size, and orientation. The predicted point coordinates derived from the EFFs are submitted to CWT for further processing. Wavelet coefficients are then computed to identify localized features, localization being a subjective process with EFFs. The advantage of wavelets is that they eliminate the inevitable subjectivity inherent in the choice of measurements. To test the usefulness of CSA, a sample of cranial base (CB) lateral radiographic outlines was available. Five archaeological periods, Yayoi, Kofun, Kamakura, Edo, and Modern, were utilized (n = 297). Statistically significant differences in sex and archaeological age were found. Although archaeological age differences were present, they were small and random in character, suggesting stability in the CB structures. In contrast, sexually dimorphic differences were present in every group from the Yayoi to the Modern period. This presence of sexually dimorphic differences in shape was consistent with earlier studies of M. nemestrina, G. gorilla, and P. troglodytes. Consequently, it is suggested that the pattern of sexual dimorphism documented in the Japanese CB is a primate pattern with an ancient evolutionary history. The results demonstrate, both visually and numerically, that CSA is a powerful approach for describing both global and localized features of craniofacial structures such as the CB. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Computational shape analysis; Continuous wavelet transform; Elliptical fourier functions","archeology; article; female; Fourier analysis; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; sex difference; skull base; Anthropology, Physical; Fourier Analysis; History, Ancient; Humans; Japan; Sex Characteristics; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-27744468345

An analysis of a subset consisting of the biomere's most characteristic taxa, the Asaphiscacea, Raymondinacea, and Marjumiacea, also illustrates this morphological diversification. In detail, the total data set and subset show a limited range of morphologies near the base of the biomere and a large increase in range in the upper portion of the biomere. Regional assemblages from the Appalachians, Great Basin, and Texas were also studied to determine if they too show the larger-scale macroevolutionary patterns of trilobites from Laurentia as a whole. The regional assemblages illustrate similar, but not identical, morphological diversifications, which are also similar to the overall Laurentian pattern. Subsets of the characteristic taxa also show this diversification. These results suggest that regional assemblages can be used to investigate these larger-scale macroevolutionary patterns.

Proposed reasons for crowding include excessively large teeth, small jaws, and a combination of both. Nevertheless, the parameters that would allow the prediction of crowding have not been identified. This study compared the shape of crowded and uncrowded dental arches, matched for size and sex. The application of elliptical Fourier functions (EFFs) provided an accurate numeric description of the dental arch form. Dental casts from the Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo, Chiba, Japan, were studied. Group I, the control group, consisted of 118 dental cast pairs (49 female, 69 male, aged 20.40 ± 1.68 years [mean ± SD]) with little or no crowding. Group II, which exhibited crowding, consisted of 78 dental cast pairs (64 female, 14 male, aged 19.67 ± 4.95 years). From photographs, a set of 24 homologous points describing the tooth row was identified. These points were then fitted with EFFs. Each maxillary and mandibular outline was subsequently standardized for size by scaling the bounded area to a constant 10,000 mm 2. These ""shape only"" data were used to assess differences between arches in the 2 groups. By multivariate analysis of variance, statistically significant shape differences between groups I and II were obtained for both arches.

This elliptical Fourier formulation has been rarely applied to date, which is probably explainable because of the mathematical complexity and the difficulty of translating the Fourier coefficients into simple geometrical concepts. Utilizing elliptical analysis, a simplified geometrical approach to the Fourier decomposition is proposed in this study. We showed that the geometrical locus of the points associated with each harmonic used in the Fourier decomposition is an ellipse. The contribution of each harmonic was then characterized with four new geometrical parameters called elliptical descriptors. These are: the half-length of the major axis (LAj), the half-length of the minor axis (LBj), the orientation of the major axis, and the phase angle. These descriptors, in contrast to classical Fourier coefficients, possess geometrical significance, and allow for an estimate of each ellipse consisting of: (1) the size of the ellipse (proportional to the product LAB· LBj), (2) the anisotropy of the ellipse (characterized by the ratio LAj/LBj), and (3) the orientation of the ellipse given by the orientation of the elliptical axes. These parameters completely define the geometry of the ellipse associated with each harmonic, and provide an evaluation of the importance of the harmonic contribution in the description of the form studied. Using these elliptical descriptors, an outline can be described, as well as reconstructed. A methodology is then proposed to characterize and to compare complex outlines using these elliptical descriptors. This new methodology allows the quantification of any form, regardless of their degree of complexity, and allows the translation of the morphological differences into simple geometrical concepts, a procedure difficult to carry out with conventional Fourier coefficients. © 2004 International Association for Mathematical Geology.","Elliptical Fourier analysis; Morphometry","ellipse; Fourier transform; geometry; image analysis; morphometry",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-4344676383

A distance metric is developed for such data and is used to embed the data in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. The Euclidean space is used to generate summary statistics such as mean and principal shape variation which are implicitly represented in the original space using elements of the sample. A new distance metric for outline shapes is proposed based on Procrustes distance that does not require the extraction of discrete points along the curve. The outline distance metric can be naturally combined with distances between landmarks. A method for aligning outlines and multiple outlines is developed that minimizes the distance metric. The method is compared with semilandmarks on synthetic data and 2 real data sets. Outline methods produce useful and valid results when suitably constrained by landmarks and are useful visualization aids, but questions remain about their suitability for answering biological questions until appropriate distance metrics can be biologically validated. © 2012 The Author(s).","Morphometrics; outline analysis; semilandmark","algorithm; animal; article; biometry; classification; computer simulation; Drosophila; histology; methodology; principal component analysis; Algorithms; Animals; Biometry; Classification; Computer Simulation; Drosophila; Principal Component Analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871839282

While most Fourier methods are mainly effective with closed outlines, the DCT can handle open curves too, making it useful for quantitative descriptions of a broad range of natural objects. Like other Fourier-type methods, the DCT yields informative numerical signatures; the shape serves as input for subsequent multivariate analysis, with, for example, principal component analysis (PCA). To test the DCT as a morphometric tool, a set of 32 ammonite ribs was analyzed. The ammonites, representing 16 different species belonging to nine genera, were from the Hildoceratidae, a major Lower Jurassic family with essentially falcoid s.l. ribs, whose taxonomy is based largely on their ornamentation. Species were selected to illustrate the broad spectrum of ribbing patterns from almost straight to falcate via sigmoidal or falcoid, exhibited by the NW European Hildoceratidae. The first six harmonic amplitudes computed by the DCT were processed by PCA. The first three factorial axes of the PCA accounted for 87.2% of the total variance. Projections of the specimens on the first two factorial planes provide a well structured plot of the entire morphospace, demonstrating that the DCT is a promising and effective tool for morphometry. © International Association for Mathematical Geology 2007.","Ammonite ribs; Discrete cosine transform; Discrete Fourier transform; Morphometry","Discrete cosine transforms; Fourier transforms; Geology; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; ammonite; discrete element method; Fourier transform; Jurassic; morphometry; multivariate analysis; taxonomy; Ammonoidea; Hildoceratidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-36749021180

This method was applied here to evaluate the discrimination power of the inner lateral rib for two palstave populations dating from the Middle Bronze Age, excavated in northwest France. A corpus of almost 400 palstaves (bronze axes) of the Breton and Norman types was processed, and compared to specimens found at Sermizelles in Burgundy. The procedure is robust and produces a discrimination in good agreement with the traditional typology. Besides the definition of a 'standard' shape for each population, the morphometrical approach allows shape disparity, which is generally inaccessible to the naked eye, to be visualised and quantified. Shape disparity indicates that, contrary to previous assumptions, the bronze axes from the Sermizelles hoards cannot be explained as an assortment of Breton and Norman palstaves alone. We believe that this approach is quick, reproducible, and generalisable enough to be applied to a wide variety of artefacts from different periods, in order to clarify their typology and even their origin. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The morphology of interest consists of the human cranial base (CB) as depicted on lateral cephalometric radiographs. Given a complex irregularly bounded form in Cartesian coordinate space, we first compute elliptical Fourier functions (EFFs) using a set of closely-spaced pseudo-homologous (x, y) points, starting at basion, to create a precise analog of the closed contour. This computed contour is then scaled (size- standardization) and rotated (positional-orientation) to provide for a common normalization. This insures that the representation is invariant with respect to starting point, size and orientation. Utilizing the EFFs, global aspects of the CB can then be extracted. The coordinates derived from the EFF were subsequently submitted to a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Wavelet coefficients were then computed to identify localized features. The significant advantage of wavelets is that they are able to objectively identify changes in boundary curvature, thereby depicting localized aspects not easily attainable with other methods. Utilizing a sample of 297 Japanese cranial base outlines, statistically-significant differences in sex and archeological age were found. Although archeological age differences were present, they were small and largely random in character, suggesting stability in the CB structures. The presence of sexually dimorphic differences is consistent with earlier data derived from studies of Macaca nemestrina. In the current study, these differences in sexual dimorphism were present for every group starting with the Yayoi period and continuing up to the Modern period. Consequently, one may infer that the pattern of sexual dimorphism documented in the Japanese CB, is a primate pattern with an ancient evolutionary history. Wavelets were particularly useful in objectively identifying this sexual dimorphism. The results demonstrate that the Fourier-wavelet representation is a practical approach for numerically describing and visually depicting both global and localized features.","Cranial base; Elliptical Fourier functions; Fourier descriptors; Sexual dimorphism; Wavelets","analytic method; conference paper; craniofacial morphology; Fourier analysis; geological era; history; Macaca; sex difference; skull base; spectral sensitivity",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142516474

Here, a set of 629 bronze palstaves excavated in northern France, belonging to Breton and Norman typological groups, was treated by (open) outline-based morphometrics with orthogonal polynomial regression. Using robust statistics developed for outlier detection, these Norman and Breton palstave outlines can be divided into two groups: those for which the shape fluctuates close to the standard shape, called ""congruent"" axes, and those which are far enough from this standard to be considered as ""non-congruent"", although they possess most of the features of the typological group. The highest density of discovery (whether congruent and non-congruent in shape) is in the extreme east of Brittany for the Breton axes, while the Norman axes are concentrated in northern Normandy, hence the choice of names. However, the distribution of congruent and non-congruent artifacts appears to be spatially dependent for the Norman group, and to a lesser extent for the Breton group, as there are proportionally more congruent specimens inside the supposed production areas than outside. This contradicts the generally accepted archaeological scheme which hypothesizes that all axes in a group originate from the same production center, and that some items were exported from there to supply neighboring regions. Other minor production centers probably existed, copying the original model with greater shape variation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeology; Axe; Morphometrics; Open contour; Orthogonal polynomials; Shape analysis; Typology","archaeology; artifact; Bronze Age; morphometry; shape analysis; spatial distribution; typology; Bretagne; France",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867904485

These are: [1] the "" out of Africa"" hypothesis and [2] the "" multiregional"" hypothesis. This paper is an attempt to try to reconcile these two scenarios using hominid cranial vault data. Elliptical Fourier functions (EFFs) were used to describe, in visual and numerical terms, the shape of the human cranial vault in norma lateralis.Using jpeg images, contours of the cranial vault of a large sample of hominid specimens were pre-processed in Photoshop CS and rotated in 2D space (positional-orientation) so that a line drawn from nasion to porion was horizontal. The cranial vault image was then digitized with 72 closely-spaced points and submitted to a specially written routine that computed EFFs normalized by scaling (size-standardization). This ensured that the representation was invariant with respect to starting point, size and orientation.Statistically significant differences were found between the H. sapiens sample and both the H. erectus and H. neanderthalensis samples. In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences between the H. erectus and H. neanderthalensis groups, leading to three conclusions: [1] the similarity in cranial vault shape between H. erectus and H. neanderthalensis suggests a single gradually evolving lineage; [2] The taxon H. heidelbergensis can be embedded into the H. erectus→. H. neanderthalensis line; and [3] H. sapiens seems to be a separate evolutionary development and is considered here either as a separate species or as a possible example of an allopatric semispecies (Grant, 1977). The results here suggest that human evolution over the last 2. Ma may turn out to be neither totally multiregional or simply out of Africa but rather represents a considerably more complicated picture. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",,"Africa; animal; article; Asia; Europe; evolution; fossil; Fourier analysis; histology; history; hominid; human; India; paleontology; phylogeny; skull; Africa; Animals; Asia; Biological Evolution; Europe; Fossils; Fourier Analysis; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; India; Paleontology; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957793647
