The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as ''eigenfaces,'' because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.",,"article; computer analysis; face; human; human experiment; nerve cell network; normal human; recognition",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026065565

Box 349, Warkworth, New Zealand","A flexible method is needed for constrained ordination on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure, which will display a cloud of multivariate points by reference to a specific a priori hypothesis. We suggest the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCO, metric MDS), followed by either a canonical discriminant analysis (CDA, when the hypothesis concerns groups) or a canonical correlation analysis (CCorA, when the hypothesis concerns relationships with environmental or other variables), to provide a flexible and meaningful constrained ordination of ecological species abundance data. Called ""CAP"" for ""Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates,"" this method will allow a constrained ordination to be done on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure. We describe CAP in detail, including how it can uncover patterns that are masked in an unconstrained MDS ordination. Canonical tests using permutations are also given, and we show how the method can be used (1) to place a new observation into the canonical space using only interpoint dissimilarities, (2) to classify observations and obtain misclassification or residual errors, and (3) to correlate the original variables with patterns on Canonical plots. Misclassification error or residual error is used to obtain a non-arbitrary decision concerning the appropriate dimensionality of the response data cloud (number of PCO axes) for the ensuing canonical analysis. We suggest that a CAP ordination and an unconstrained ordination, such as MDS, together will provide important information for meaningful multivariate analyses of ecological data by reference to explicit a priori hypotheses.","Canonical ordination; Classification; Community structure; Distance matrix; MDS; Multivariate analysis; Principal coordinate analysis; Species abundances; Statistical methods","canonical analysis; multivariate analysis; ordination",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042815050

A suction electrode was used to record the membrane current of single rod outer segments in pieces of toad retina. During dim illumination the membrane current showed pronounced fluctuations. 2. Amplitude histograms of responses to dim flashes of fixed intensity exhibited two discrete peaks, one at 0 pA and one near 1 pA, suggesting that the response was quantized. By setting a criterion amplitude level, flash responses could be classed as 'failures' (no response) or as 'successes' (at least one quantal event). 3. The variation of fraction of successes with flash intensity was consistent with the hypothesis that each quantal electrical event resulted from a single photoisomerization. 4. The quantal event had a mean amplitude of about 1 pA (5% of the standing dark current) and a standard deviation of 0.2 pA. Dispersion in the event amplitude prevented identification of histogram peaks corresponding to two or more photoisomerizations. 5. Individual quantal responses exhibited a smooth shape very similar to that of the average quantal response. This suggests that a single photoisomerization releases many particles of transmitter and that radial diffusion of internal transmitter is not a major source of delay in the light response. 6. The 'quantum efficiency' with which an absorbed photon generated an electrical event was measured as 0.5 +/‐ 0.1 (S.E. of mean, n = 4). This is slightly lower than the quantum efficiency of photoisomerization obtained previously for rhodopsin in solution. 7. At wavelengths between 420 and 700 nm the quantal event was invariant in size, although the cell's sensitivity varied over a range of 10(5). 8. The power spectrum of the fluctuations in dim steady light was predicted by assuming that a random series of quantal events occurred independently. 9. In brighter light the fluctuations were faster, and the response to an incremental flash was reduced in size and duration. The power spectrum could be predicted by assuming random superposition of events with the shape of the incremental flash response. © 1979 The Physiological Society",,"animal experiment; photon; retina rod; retina rod outer segment potential; visual system; animal; article; cell membrane potential; electric conductivity; elementary particle; in vitro study; kinetics; light; photoreceptor; photostimulation; physiology; toad; Animal; Bufo marinus; Electric Conductivity; Elementary Particles; In Vitro; Kinetics; Light; Membrane Potentials; Photic Stimulation; Photoreceptors; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018333003

The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle ΔABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0, 0) and landmark B to (1, 0). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S, which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling’s T2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions at an angle averaging 90° in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal grid pair. © 1986, Statistical Science.

Among documented groups, a common response to such stress is temporary movement into adjacent occupied areas-moving in with ""relatives"" when things go wrong. However, in the case of early (ca. 12,000-10,000 B.P.) Paleoindian groups in the Americas, the availability of neighboring groups with a detailed knowledge of local resource geography could not be relied upon. Post-Pleistocene environmental changes and the low initial population of the New World are important factors conditioning a lifeway characterized by a dependence on hunting (though not exclusively of megafauna), and by high residential, logistical, and range (territorial) mobility. Early Paleoindian groups had to adopt a subsistence technology that could be employed regardless of the specific resource microstructure. In some regards, Paleoindians seem to have behaved like tropical foragers while in others like arctic collectors. Use of high quality lithic raw materials from large quarry sources, reliance on a bifacial technology, limited use of caves and rockshelters, and a low level of processing of food products for storage all may be indicative of such a subsistence technology, which would have been unlike that of any modern hunter-gatherers. © 1988 Society for American Archaeology.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019768854

Since that time the field of geometric morphometrics has matured into a rich and cohesive discipline for the study of shape variation and covariation. The development of the field is identified with the Procrustes paradigm, a methodological approach to shape analysis arising from the intersection of the statistical shape theory and analytical procedures for obtaining shape variables from landmark data. In this review we describe the Procrustes paradigm and the current methodological toolkit of geometric morphometrics. We highlight some of the theoretical advances that have occurred over the past ten years since our prior review (Adams et al., 2004), what types of anatomical structures are amenable to these approaches, and how they extend the reach of geometric morphometrics to more specialized applications for addressing particular biological hypotheses. We end with a discussion of some possible areas that are fertile ground for future development in the field. © 2013 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.","Morphology; Procrustes analysis; Shape analysis; Statistics",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875767161

The routine identification of specimens of previously described species has many of the characteristics of other activities that have been automated, and poses a major constraint on studies in many areas of both pure and applied biology. In this paper, we consider some of the reasons why automated species identification has not become widely employed, and whether it is a realistic option, addressing the notions that it is too difficult, too threatening, too different or too costly. Although recognizing that there are some very real technical obstacles yet to be overcome, we argue that progress in the development of automated species identification is extremely encouraging that such an approach has the potential to make a valuable contribution to reducing the burden of routine identifications. Vision and enterprise are perhaps more limiting at present than practical constraints on what might possibly be achieved.","Automated identification; Computer-assisted taxonomy; Routine identification; Taxonomic impediment","automation; computer system; taxonomy",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1942423755

Major causal factors are the artisan's knowledge and experience, extent of feedback on performance in activities along the artifact's behavioral chain, situational factors in behavioral chain activities, technological constraints, and social processes of conflict and negotiation. In identifying the causal factors at work in a specific case, the investigator must focus analytically on activities - that is, on people-people, people-artifact, and artifact-artifact interactions - and on the performance characteristics relevant to each. Application of this behavioral framework allows abandonment of many cherished but unhelpful concepts, including style and function.

Among these properties, the concentration of the norm phenomenon results in the fact that Euclidean norms and Gaussian kernels, both commonly used in models, become inappropriate in high-dimensional spaces.

As the practical implementation of ABC requires computations based on vectors of summary statistics, rather than full data sets, a central question is how to derive low-dimensional summary statistics from the observed data with minimal loss of information. In this article we provide a comprehensive review and comparison of the performance of the principal methods of dimension reduction proposed in the ABC literature. The methods are split into three nonmutually exclusive classes consisting of best subset selection methods, projection techniques and regularization. In addition, we introduce two new methods of dimension reduction. The first is a best subset selection method based on Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, and the second uses ridge regression as a regularization procedure. We illustrate the performance of these dimension reduction techniques through the analysis of three challenging models and data sets. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2013.","Approximate Bayesian computation; Dimension reduction; Likelihood-free inference; Regularization; Variable selection",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878991573

Metric data on 449 North American points, 31 Central American points, and 61 South American points were entered into a database. Ratios calculated from these metric attributes are used to quantify aspects of point shape across the two continents. The results of this analysis indicate gradual, progressive changes in fluted point outline shape from the Great Plains of western North America into adjacent parts of North America as well as into Central and South America. The South American ""Fishtail"" form of fluted point is seen as the culmination of incremental changes in point shape that began well into North America. A geographically gradual decline in fluting frequency also is consistent with the stylistic evolution of the stemmed ""Fishtail"" points. Although few in number, the available radiocarbon dates do suggest that ""Fishtail"" fluted points in southern South America are younger than the earliest dates associated with Clovis points in western North America. All of these data converge on the conclusion that South American ""Fishtail"" points evolved from North American fluted points.

Bones and artifacts occurred on and in gravels of a former perennial stream exposed in the modern arroyo bank. Most or all of the animals were probably killed over a comparatively short period by hunters identified with the Llano complex by the Clovis points. The Lehner site and the nearby Naco site represent the southwesternmost extent of the presently known range of the Llano complex. The post-kill sequence of alluviation and erosion supports a geological age of 13,000 or more years for both bones and artifacts. Arizona, Michigan, and Copenhagen radiocarbon measurements of hearth charcoal indicate a date of 11,000 to 12,000 B.P. Since these dates are substantially older than the oldest radiocarbon assays for the Sulphur Spring stage of the Cochise culture, it is probable that the transition from big-game hunting to collecting is reflected in the change from Llano complex to Cochise culture, and that this shift in economic emphasis took place before the complete extinction of the late Pleistocene megafauna.

We consider that claim to be true under most conditions for characters discovered by commonly used morphometric methods, including outline-based and conventional multivariate methods. The most important reason these characters are unsuitable is that one of the tests of homology, the test of similarity, may be difficult to apply to them. This test is not even possible if the methods for comparing forms, such as outline-based techniques, do not ensure that the characters are located in the same part of the anatomy. Conventional methods, including principal components analysis, have no explicit basis for localizing characters. In addition, unless the transformation between forms is homogeneous, conventional methods cannot dissect transformations region by region to discover characters. However, one morphometric method, the thin-plate spline decomposed by its partial warps (TPS), finds characters that can be subjected to the same tests of homology (conjunction, similarity, and congruence) that we would apply to all other characters. Among available methods, TPS is unique in being able to locate the center and spatial extent of regional differences in shape and ensures that the same regions are compared among forms. We provide an example using the teleost fishes piranhas, in which tests of homology are applied to a synapomorphy found by the method. © 1995 Society of Systematic Biologists.","Character analysis; Homology; Morphometrics; Piranha; Pygocentrus; Pygopristis; Serrasalmus; Synapomorphy; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029525755

Without loss of generality, we use genomic study with gene expression measurements as a representative example but note that analysis techniques discussed in this article are also applicable to other types of bioinformatics studies. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a classic dimension reduction approach. It constructs linear combinations of gene expressions, called principal components (PCs). The PCs are orthogonal to each other, can effectively explain variation of gene expressions, and may have a much lower dimensionality. PCA is computationally simple and can be realized using many existing software packages. This article consists of the following parts. First, we review the standard PCA technique and their applications in bioinformatics data analysis. Second, we describe recent 'non-standard' applications of PCA, including accommodating interactions among genes, pathways and network modules and conducting PCAwith estimating equations as opposed to gene expressions. Third, we introduce several recently proposed PCA-based techniques, including the supervised PCA, sparse PCA and functional PCA. The supervised PCA and sparse PCA have been shown to have better empirical performance than the standard PCA. The functional PCA can analyze time-course gene expression data. Last, we raise the awareness of several critical but unsolved problems related to PCA. The goal of this article is to make bioinformatics researchers aware of the PCA technique and more importantly its most recent development, so that this simple yet effective dimension reduction technique can be better employed in bioinformatics data analysis.","Bioinformatics methodologies; Dimension reduction; Gene expression; Principal component analysis","article; biology; gene expression profiling; genomics; methodology; principal component analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Genomics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052160144

A bone concentration, though known for some time, was freshly exposed by floods resulting from heavy summer rains in August, 1951. This encouraged Fred Navarrete to dig in an attempt to salvage what appeared to be a part of a skull with teeth and tusk of a large animal. In the course of this work he found near the skull a projectile point in what appeared to be undisturbed matrix. Additional excavations by Marc Navarrete soon revealed the left foreleg, scapula, humerus, and ulna and, near the superior margin of the scapula, again in the undisturbed clay, a second projectile point came to light.

Anderson's (I 990, 1996) staging-area model predicts that Clovis settlement was more gradual; groups entered the continent and slowed migration to concentrate territorial ranges around resource-rich river valleys, and these staging areas became the demographic foundations for early cultural regionalizalion. This study analyzes southeastern Clovis point data and biface assemblages from Carson-Conn-Short. Topper, and Williamson to test the technological implications of these two models. Significant subregional variation exists in Clovis point morphology and biface production techniques. This variation suggests the subregions represent distinct populations who distinctly altered aspects of their technology but maintained fundamental elements of the Clovis tradition. These findings are at odds with the high-technology forager model and more closely fit the staging-area model. © 2012 by the Society tor American Archaeology.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876439550

It portrays pre-Darwinian taxonomists as caught in the grip of an ancient philosophy called essentialism, from which they were not released until Charles Darwin's 1859 Origin of Species. Mayr's motive was to promote the Modern Synthesis in opposition to the typology of idealist morphologists; demonizing Plato served this end. Arthur Cain's picture of Linnaeus as a follower of 'Aristotelian' (scholastic) logic was woven into the story, along with David Hull's application of Karl Popper's term, 'essentialism', which Mayr accepted in 1968 as a synonym for what he had called 'typological thinking'. Although Mayr also pointed out the importance of empiricism in the history of taxonomy, the essentialism story still dominates the secondary literature. The history of the first telling of the essentialism story exposes its scant basis in fact. © 2006 Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn.","Arthur Cain; David Hull; Ernst Mayr; Essentialism; Essentialism story; Historiography; History of systematics; History of taxonomy; Karl Popper; Species concept; Typology","article; classification; evolution; history; human; philosophy; Classification; Evolution; Historiography; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Philosophy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547432163

However, the accuracy of these assessments has never been evaluated. Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes).

While several attributes usually help define a "" type,"" shape is invariably the most important. Here I report on a study that uses landmark-based geometric morphometrics to better define three Paleoindian point types from Florida: Suwannees, Simpsons, and Transitional Side Notched. Bilaterally symmetric specimens were created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating the types. The results show that the base configurations were best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife allocation tests. The entire point shape was less robust due to the variability in blade shape. The study demonstrates that the three point types can be rigorously defined in ways that are usable in daily archaeological practice, and that base shape, rather than the entire shape, is a better discriminator. Further, the study demonstrates the utility of using several freeware programs for processing and analyzing shape data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Geometric morphometrics; Hafting; Landmarks; Paleoindian; Symmetry; Typology","archaeology; artifact; geometry; morphometry; symmetry; typology; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857117297

Here, we report an attempt to resolve this argument using a large sample of Clovis points from dated assemblages and a suite of shape analysis methods known as geometric morphometrics. The study tested the two main hypotheses that have been put forward in the debate: the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis, which holds that Clovis points do not vary regionally, and the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis, which holds that there is regional variation as a consequence of Clovis groups adjusting their food-getting toolkits to local conditions. We used discriminant function analysis and a multivariate extension of the t test to assess whether differences in shape exist at two scales. The first set of analyses compared points from the most obvious environmental regions in North America, the East and the West. The second set of analyses investigated differences among points from subregions within the East and West. The analyses revealed significant differences between points from the East and the West and among points from some subregions. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these differences are not the result of the most common confounding factors, raw material quality and resharpening. As such, the analyses support the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis rather than the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis. We conclude from this that Clovis people modified their points to suit the characteristics of local prey and/or the habitats in which they hunted. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Clovis points; Continent-wide adaptation; Geometric morphometrics; Regional environmental adaptation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898651207

The site is one of the earliest documented co-occurrences of Clovis points and mammoth. Reinvestigation of the site and related collections was undertaken to better understand the stratigraphy, geochronology, and archaeology. The basin, 23 m diameter × 1.6 m deep, filled with (1) dark gray silty clay, and (2) near the top of the section, a lens of well-sorted silt or loess. The basin started to fill ca. 13,700 yr B.P., the loess dates to ca. 11,400 yr B.P., and the bone bed probably dates to ca. 11,400-10,500 yr B.P. The loess may be the local manifestation of a “Clovis drought.” The partial remains of five mammoths (three adults and two juveniles) were recovered in 1937; no other animal remains are known. The bone is heavily weathered and there are no clear indications of human modification. Artifacts found at the site include three Clovis points and a scraper found among the bones and two flakes and a scraper found on the surface near the playa. The origins of the bone and stone assemblage are uncertain but four scenarios are offered: a successful mammoth kill, an unsuccessful kill with wounded animals dying at the watering hole, opportunistic scavenging following natural deaths, or a palimpsest of multiple deaths following both natural and human causes. © 1994 Academic Press.

Machine learning offers opportunities to analyze large numbers of specimens, to discover novel leaf features of angiosperm clades that may have phylogenetic significance, and to use those characters to classify unknowns. Previous computer vision approaches have primarily focused on leaf identification at the species level. It remains an open question whether learning and classification are possible among major evolutionary groups such as families and orders, which usually contain hundreds to thousands of species each and exhibit many times the foliar variation of individual species. Here, we tested whether a computer vision algorithm could use a database of 7, 597 leaf images from 2, 001 genera to learn features of botanical families and orders, then classify novel images. The images are of cleared leaves, specimens that are chemically bleached, then stained to reveal venation. Machine learning was used to learn a codebook of visual elements representing leaf shape and venation patterns. The resulting automated system learned to classify images into families and orders with a success rate many times greater than chance. Of direct botanical interest, the responses of diagnostic features can be visualized on leaf images as heat maps, which are likely to prompt recognition and evolutionary interpretation of a wealth of novel morphological characters. With assistance from computer vision, leaves are poised to make numerous new contributions to systematic and paleobotanical studies.","Computer vision; Leaf architecture; Leaf venation; Paleobotany; Sparse coding","angiosperm; Article; cladistics; Combretaceae; computer analysis; machine learning; morphological trait; Phyllanthaceae; phylogeny; plant leaf; plant taxonomy; priority journal; Rubiaceae; Machine Learning; Plant Leaves",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962310740

How does visual cognition work? What are its moving parts? This paper reviews the origins and architecture of visual cognition and briefly describes some work in the areas of routines, attention, surfaces, objects, and events (motion, causality, and agency). Most vision scientists avoid being too explicit when presenting concepts about visual cognition, having learned that explicit models invite easy criticism. What we see in the literature is ample evidence for visual cognition, but few or only cautious attempts to detail how it might work. This is the great unfinished business of vision research: at some point we will be done with characterizing how the visual system measures the world and we will have to return to the question of how vision constructs models of objects, surfaces, scenes, and events. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Attention; Cognition; Motion; Object recognition; Vision","attention; brightness; cognition; depth perception; executive function; human; illumination; movement perception; nonhuman; pattern recognition; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; receptive field; review; short term memory; spatial attention; task performance; vision; visual cognition; visual field; visual information; visual memory; visual stimulation; Attention; Cognition; Executive Function; Humans; Signal Detection, Psychological; Visual Perception",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960641369

Here, we test this hypothesis quantitatively with matrix correlation statistics. Using a sample of Early Paleoindian point assemblages from across the continent we attempt to correlate variation in point shape with several measures of late Pleistocene period regional variation including net primary production, prey availability, prey selection, and prey body size. We find no significant correlations between point shape and measures of regional variation, suggesting that functional modifications to points within specific regional biomes were minimal. We do find evidence of spatial autocorrelation as the regional variation in point shape correlates positively with geographic distances among sites, a pattern consistent with recent, shared ancestry. Our findings provide support for the drift hypothesis posed by Morrow and Morrow (1999). We interpret these results as suggesting that despite the wide variation in regional environmental conditions across late Pleistocene period North America not enough time elapsed during the Early Paleoindian period for these local selective gradients to have led to significant changes in point shape. Recientemente se ha sugerido que las variaciones encontradas en las puntas de proyectiles a lo largo de Norteamerica durante la etapa temprana del periodo Paleoindio file el resultado de deriva, en lugar de la adaptacion regional (Morrow y Morrow 1999).

Less is known of their hunting strategies for other large animals, such as horse, camel, and bison, although remains of these animals have been found at several Clovis camps. Recent investigations of the Jake Bluff site on the southern Plains have identified a Clovis bison kill in an arroyo. The apparent use of an arroyo style trap for bison hunting provides the opportunity to study Clovis hunting strategies that came to be widely used during later PaleoIndian times. The arroyo style bison trap is generally attributed to Folsom and later groups, and yet the Jake Bluff site yielded an association of Clovis-style projectile points with the remains of 22 Bison antiquus at the bottom of a short arroyo. The late date of 12,838 cal. BP suggests that the site spans the gap between the Clovis mammoth hunter and the Folsom bison hunter, indicating that some Clovis hunters developed the arroyo style bison trap to capture multiple bison at the same time, and as mammoths were extirpated from certain areas during the Pleistocene to Holocene transition.

These early hunter-gatherers camped, collected stone, and shaped it into a variety of tools they needed to hunt game, process food, and subsist in the Texas wilderness. Their toolkit included bifaces, blades, and deadly spear points. Where they worked, they left thousands of pieces of debris, which have allowed archaeologists to reconstruct their methods of tool production. Along with the faunal material that was also discarded in their prehistoric campsite, these stone, or lithic, artifacts afford a glimpse of human life at the end of the last ice age during an era referred to as Clovis. The area where these people roamed and camped, called the Gault site, is one of the most important Clovis sites in North America. A decade ago a team from Texas A&M University excavated a single area of the site-formally named Excavation Area 8, but informally dubbed the Lindsey Pit-which features the densest concentration of Clovis artifacts and the clearest stratigraphy at the Gault site. Some 67,000 lithic artifacts were recovered during fieldwork, along with 5,700 pieces of faunal material. In a thorough synthesis of the evidence from this prehistoric ""workshop,"" Michael R.

One prominent example of this debate is Clovis technology (13,350-12,500 calendar years before present), which represents the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America. Clovis projectile points appear to have been made the same way regardless of region, but several studies have documented differences in shape that appear to be regional. Two processes have been proposed for shape variation: (1) stochastic mechanisms such as copy error (drift) and (2) Clovis groups adapting their hunting equipment to the characteristics of prey and local habitat. We used statistical analysis of Clovis-point flake-scar pattern and geometric morphometrics to examine whether drift alone could cause significant differences in the technology of Stone Age colonizing hunter-gatherers. Importantly, our analysis was intraregional to rule out a priori environmental adaptation. Our analysis confirmed that the production technique was the same across the sample, but we found significant shape differences in Clovis point populations made from distinct stone outcrops. Given that current archaeological evidence suggests stone outcrops were ""hubs"" of regional Clovis activity, our dichotomous, intraregional results quantitatively confirm that Clovis foragers engaged in two tiers of social learning. The lower, ancestral tier relates to point production and can be tied to conformist transmission of tool-making processes across the Clovis population. The upper, derived tier relates to point shape, which can be tied to drift that resulted from increased forager interaction at different stone-outcrop hubs and decreased forager interaction among groups using different outcrops. Given that Clovis artifacts represent the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America, our results suggest that we need to alter our theoretical understanding of how quickly drift can occur within a colonizing population and create differences among socially learned technological characters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cultural transmission; Dispersals; Drift; Geometric morphometrics; Hunter-gatherers; Peopling of the Americas","archaeological evidence; archaeology; artifact; colonization; dispersal; hunter-gatherer; learning; morphometry; new world order; Pleistocene; Stone Age; North America; archeology; cultural anthropology; human; migration; North America; social learning; weapon; Archaeology; Cultural Evolution; Human Migration; Humans; North America; Social Learning; Weapons",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923363624

The new macrobotantical remains from Shawnee-Minisink have provided a series of AMS dates, which offer the most precise age estimate for Clovis in the Northeast and provide an alternative interpretation concerning the role plants in the subsistence practices of early Paleoindians.

One long-held explanation for the variation in early Paleoindian point form is that prey size influenced the size and shape of projectile points. The study reported here evaluated this hypothesis with standard and geometric morphometric data recorded on Clovis and Folsom points from the Southern Plains and Southwest that are associated with mammoth or bison remains. Points used to hunt mammoth were found to be larger and of a different shape than points used to hunt bison, which supports the hypothesis. However, when both point type and prey size were taken into account, the results ran counter to predictions.

Although this pattern is widely reported in different carnivoran families, the mechanisms driving the evolution of carnivoran skull morphology remain largely unexplored. In this study we use coordinate-point extended eigenshape analysis (CP-EES) to summarize aspects of skull shape in large fissiped carnivores. Results of these comparisons enable the evaluation of the role of different factors constraining the evolution of carnivoran skull design. Empirical morphospaces derived from mandible anatomy show that all hypercarnivores (i.e., those species with a diet that consists almost entirely of vertebrate flesh) share a set of traits involved in a functional compromise between bite force and gape angle, which is reflected in a strong pattern of morphological convergence. Although the paths followed by different taxa to reach this ""hypercarnivore shape-space"" differ because of phylogenetic constraints, the morphological signature of hypercarnivory in the mandible is remarkably narrow and well constrained. In contrast, CP-EES of cranial morphology does not reveal a similar pattern of shape convergence among hypercarnivores. This suggests a lesser degree of morphological plasticity in the cranium compared to the mandible, which probably results from a compromise between different functional demands in the cranium (e.g., feeding, vision, olfactory sense, and brain processing) whereas the mandible is only involved in food acquisition and processing. Combined analysis of theoretical and empirical morphospaces for these skull data also show the lower anatomical disparity of felids and hyaenids compared to canids and ursids. This indicates that increasing specialization within the hypercarnivorous niche may constrain subsequent morphological and ecological flexibility. During the Cenozoic, similar skull traits appeared in different carnivoran lineages, generated by similar selection pressures (e.g., toward hypercarnivory) and shared developmental pathways. These pathways were likely the proximate source of constraints on the degree of variation associated with carnivoran skull evolution and on its direction. © 2011 The Paleontological Society.

Clovis may be the best documented Paleoamerican culture in North America, but much remains to be learned about the movement and interactions of Clovis peoples. Similarities among Clovis points from geographically diverse locations have led some researchers to suggest that a uniform projectile point technology existed across North America during Clovis times. Others have rejected this idea, proposing local and independent technological adaptations to different regional environments. To investigate these ideas, we used digital morphometrics to analyze 50 Clovis points from nine different contexts. First, 3D surface models of the points were created with a portable laser scanner. Next, these models were digitally cross-sectioned through both faces, yielding two-dimensional isoheight contours of flake scar patterns that reflect the original reduction techniques used to shape the projectile points. In the final step, the contours were transformed with elliptic Fourier analysis into Fourier coefficient series, and patterns of variation and symmetry were explored with principal components analysis. When compared to modern Clovis point replicas made by an expert knapper, the flake scar contours of the ancient Clovis points showed little morphological variation and a large degree of bifacial symmetry. Our results support the existence of a widespread standardized ""Clovis"" knapping technique, most likely transmitted through direct interaction between knappers from different groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","3D scanning; Contour analysis; Lithic technology; Morphology; Paleoindians; Pleistocene","archaeological evidence; artifact; digital image; morphometry; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; three-dimensional modeling; tool use; North America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862121378

The lower part of the fill in the sink contained no recognizable fossils, but at a level 1 or 1% feet below the present surface was a bone layer extending entirely across the sink. Above this level, no additional bones were found. No bones other than elephant were present. The conditions of occurrence indicate that several elephants are present, ranging in age from very young to mature. In the bone bed were found one scraper and three spears. One of the spears lay about 3 inches from, and at the same level as, the first cervical vertebra of an elephant. Another spear and the scraper were near elephant bones. The artifacts are of the Folsom or Folsom-like culture type. Whether the elephants were trapped or bogged at this water-hole or suffered from drought or illness is unknown. The sink in which the fossils are found is much older than the modern sinks of this region, as shown by the fact that it had become completely filled. The age of the deposits is not fully determined. It is, however, evident that important faunal and topographic changes have occurred since the artifacts and elephant remains were included in this deposit. © 1938 Geological Society of America.",,"Deposits; Tools; Cervical vertebra; Level-1; Roberts; Sink-in; Topographic changes; Bone; biostratigraphy; bone; drought stress; elephant; fossil record; skeleton; Florida [United States]; Miami; Texas; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042682978

Its spatial and temporal extent is truly remarkable and consequently raises a number of questions. In this paper, we focus on Clovis typology and chronology, especially how it relates to definitions of “Clovis as artifact type” versus “Clovis as colonizing behavior.” We derive our definition of “Classic Clovis” from sites located on the Great Plains (e.g., the Clovis type site along Blackwater Draw, New Mexico; Miami, Texas; Dent, Colorado), and the group of mammoth kills in the southwestern U.S. (e.g., Naco, Lehner, Murray Springs). These sites, and a handful of other dated sites with Clovis technology, fall within ~13.4k–12.7k cal yr BP (11,600–10,80014C yr BP). We conclude by describing the range of variation in the context of the sites that are most frequently used to define Clovis technology in North America. These include fluted points associated with remains of extinct fauna, Clovis points associated with radiocarbon-dated deposits, buried deposits with distinctive Clovis technology, surface sites with Clovis technology, dated sites without Classic Clovis artifacts, and surface sites with Clovis technology. © 2014 by Kelly E.

Recent developments in computer architectures and innovations in software design have placed the tools needed to realize this vision in the hands of the systematics community, not several years hence, but now. And not just for DNA barcodes or other molecular data, but for digital images of organisms, digital sounds, digitized chemical data-essentially any type of digital data. Based on evidence accumulated over the last decade and written by applied researchers, Automated Taxon Identification in Systematics explores contemporary applications of quantitative approaches to the problem of taxon recognition. The book begins by reviewing the current state of systematics and placing automated taxon identification in the context of contemporary trends, needs, and opportunities. The chapters present and evaluate different aspects of current automated system designs. They then provide descriptions of case studies in which different theoretical and practical aspects of the overall group-identification problem are identified, analyzed, and discussed. A recurring theme through the chapters is the relationship between taxonomic identification, automated group identification, and morphometrics. This collection provides a bridge between these communities and between them and the wider world of applied taxonomy.

Resting atop an ancient paleosol, the earliest sand stratum (19,540 ± 70 14C yr B.P.) is marked by a conspicuous but culturally sterile buried surface horizon. Eolian sand above this surface supports another sequum in which Clovis and underlying ""Blade"" artifacts are associated with a fainter surface horizon and pronounced subsoil lamellae. Early Archaic and successively younger artifacts occur above the Clovis level in a more weakly developed uppermost sequum.

Here, we use experimental replication to establish two quantitative predictions that would be indicative of biface-core transport. If bifaces are being used as mobile cores, then we should see among a group of sites of varying toolstone procurement distances (a) a negative relationship between toolstone procurement distance and the mean unifacial tool maximum-thickness value from each site; and (b) a negative relationship between toolstone procurement distance and the variability (standard deviation) of maximum flake thickness values from each site. We then test these predictions against data from six Clovis sites of varying toolstone procurement distance in the Lower Great Lakes region. The results show that both sets of data possess a strong, positive relationship with increasing toolstone procurement distance, which is inconsistent with the notion that biface-cores were transported. Since the Clovis presence in the Lower Great Lakes is widely acknowledged to be a colonization pulse, we conclude that the lack of biface-core transport there is an economizing and risk- mitigating behavior consistent with the models of Kuhn (1994) and Meltzer (2002, 2003, 2004).

We show that German-language idealistic-morphological theories consisted of two clearly distinguishable parts. The cornerstone of these theories was the concept of the type as an abstract pattern representing a certain class of phenomena and embodying the norm of this class. The primary objective of pure typology was to create a non-phylogenetic classification system for living organisms based on structurally explicable characters. Thus, typology, as a non-phylogenetic foundation of idealistic morphology, was conceptually neutral with respect to hypotheses of evolutionary mechanisms. Typology was often accompanied by concepts such as Lamarckism, orthogenesis, creationism, essentialism, etc. These peripheral (with respect to pure typology) concepts were autonomous constructions and did not represent a direct logical consequence of typology. In our view ""population thinking"", as part of the Darwinian theory of evolutionary mechanism, could not be directly opposed to ""typological thinking"". Rather, it was peripheral concepts such as essentialism or creationism that led to conflicts between the Modern Synthesis and idealistic morphology. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

The least complicated hypothesis is that they were intended to arm hunting weapons. It has also been argued that they were produced for use in rituals or in connection with costly signaling displays. Lastly, it has been suggested that some cached Clovis points may have been used as saws. Here we report a study in which we morphometrically compared Clovis points from caches with Clovis points recovered from kill and camp sites to test two predictions of the hypothesis that cached Clovis points were intended to arm hunting weapons: 1) cached points should be the same shape as, but generally larger than, points from kill/camp sites, and 2) cached points and points from kill/camp sites should follow the same allometric trajectory. The results of the analyses are consistent with both predictions and therefore support the hypothesis. A follow-up review of the fit between the results of the analyses and the predictions of the other hypotheses indicates that the analyses support only the hunting equipment hypothesis. We conclude from this that cached Clovis points were likely produced with the intention of using them to arm hunting weapons. © 2012 Buchanan et al.",,"allometry; animal hunting; archeology; data base; geographic distribution; human; morphometrics; principal component analysis; review; simulation; weapon; archeology; article; artifact; methodology; United States; weapon; Archaeology; Artifacts; Humans; Southwestern United States; Weapons",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856795784

Thus, exploring variability on the original designs can be informative of cultural adaptive processes on past populations. However, the complex life-cycle of a stone tool includes loops of damage due to use followed by breakage and resharpening that dramatically blur the size and shape attributes defining the original design. Here we use the Factor Model, a statistical approach recently modified to be used in landmark data, to evaluate original design attributes versus changes attributed to maintenance activities on a sample of Southern Patagonia lithic stemmed points, including arrows and spears. The model enables the separation of shape aspects that tend to covary because of common factors affecting simultaneously the two fundamental modules of a classical stemmed weapon (blade/stem), from those shape features explained only by local factors affecting modules independently. Our results show that original design differences explain most of the total shape variation, and also indicate that maintenance patterns differ among point types considered as different weapon systems (arrows and spears). Whereas arrow reduction is focused on tip modifications, spears present a broader array of shape changes including the tip and the shoulders. These results demonstrate that disentangling the sophisticated interaction among original design and maintenance activities of lithic projectile points enables a proper and independent exploration of adaptation to functional demands and cognitive models of past populations.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Factor model; Geometric morphometrics; Lithic projectile points; Shape variation","factor analysis; lithic fragment; modeling; morphometry; tool use; design; geometry; numerical model; shape; statistical analysis; weapon; Patagonia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884376430

For Clovis peoples, the earliest well-documented North Americans, resharpening is believed to have been particularly important because foraging territories were unknown or poorly known. Gardner (1983, Archaeol East N Amer 11, 49-64) proposed a spatial model of Clovis point resharpening wherein the effects of resharpening increase with distance from stone outcrop. Here we report a study that quantitatively assesses Gardner's model using a large sample of Clovis points from three high-quality chert sources in the Midwest. To investigate the predictions of the model, we used least-cost pathway distances from outcrop locations to each Clovis point and three measures of point resharpening. Our expectations, derived from the model, are that as distance from outcrop increases, points should show evidence of increased resharpening and therefore be smaller in size; should deviate from the classic shape; and should exhibit greater outer-to-inner flake-scar ratios. Our results indicate that there is no spatial patterning of these three measures of point resharpening and therefore do not support Gardner's model. Further analyses suggest that resharpening was not a significant source of Clovis-point variation at the population level and that Clovis points in the Midwest may not have served as the long-life tools as has been generally assumed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Clovis; Flake-scar pattern; Geometric morphometrics; Great Lakes; Least-cost pathway; Resharpening",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929612436

Analysis of characters by raw material type or source discerned no significant differences. Variation in point form represented by most of the assemblages, including the Plainview and Milnesand type assemblages, overlaps to a significant degree.

Sixty-three fluted bifaces from eastern North America and fourteen replicate Clovis points are analyzed. Discriminant analysis shows that 3D model-based Fourier descriptors of flake scar contours are less successful than traditional metrics in correctly differentiating styles, but more successful in identifying individual knappers. Changes in the symmetry of front and back flake scars between Clovis and later fluted point styles indicate a possible shift in reduction techniques.

According to this hypothesis, hafting constrained point bases such that they are less variable than point blades. The results of several studies have been claimed to be consistent with this hypothesis. However, there are reasons to be skeptical of these results. None of the studies employed statistical tests, and all of them focused on points recovered from kill and camp sites, which makes it difficult to be certain that the differences in variability are the result of hafting rather than a consequence of resharpening. Here, we report a study in which we tested the predictions of the hafting hypothesis by statistically comparing the variability of different parts of Clovis points. We controlled for the potentially confounding effects of resharpening by analyzing largely unused points from caches as well as points from kill and camp sites. The results of our analyses were not consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis. We found that several blade characters and point thickness were no more variable than the base characters. Our results indicate that the hafting hypothesis does not hold for Clovis points and indicate that there is a need to test its applicability in relation to post-Clovis Paleoindian points. © 2012 Buchanan et al.",,"archeology; article; Clovis point; confounding variable; controlled study; correlation coefficient; environmental impact assessment; hypothesis; North America; prediction; archeology; human; methodology; tool use; Archaeology; Humans; North America; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861621113

[J. Chem. Phys. 21 (1953) 1087-1092] that one can sample from a distribution by performing Monte Carlo simulation from a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is equal to the target distribution. However, it took several decades before the statistical community embraced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as a general computational tool in Bayesian inference. The usual reasons that are advanced to explain why statisticians were slow to catch on to the method include lack of computing power and unfamiliarity with the early dynamic Monte Carlo papers in the statistical physics literature. We argue that there was a deeper reason, namely, that the structure of problems in the statistical mechanics and those in the standard statistical literature are different. To make the methods usable in standard Bayesian problems, one had to exploit the power that comes from the introduction of judiciously chosen auxiliary variables and collective moves. This paper examines the development in the critical period 1980-1990, when the ideas of Markov chain simulation from the statistical physics literature and the latent variable formulation in maximum likelihood computation (i.e., EM algorithm) came together to spark the widespread application of MCMC methods in Bayesian computation. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2010.","Data augmentation; EM algorithm; MCMC",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959843155

However, the use of these pieces as pointed tools is still subject to debate: i.e., handheld tool vs. hafted tool. Present-day technological analysis has begun to apply new methodologies in order to quantify shape variability and to decipher the role of the morphology of these pieces in relation to function; for instance, geometric morphometric analyses have recently been applied with successful results. This paper presents a study of this type of analysis on 37 convergent tools from level Ga of Payre site (France), dated to MIS 8-7. These pieces are non-standardized knapping products produced by discoidal and orthogonal core technologies. Moreover, macro-wear studies attest to various activities on diverse materials with no evidence of hafting or projectile use. The aim of this paper is to test the geometric morphometric approach on non-standardized artefacts applying the Elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA) to 3D contours and to assess the potential relationship between size and shape, technology and function. This study is innovative in that it is the first time that this method, considered to be a valuable complement for describing technological and functional attributes, is applied to 3D contours of lithic products. Our results show that this methodology ensures a very good degree of accuracy in describing shape variations of the sharp edges of technologically non-standardized convergent tools. EFA on 3D contours indicates variations in deviations of the outline along the third dimension (i.e., dorso-ventrally) and yields quantitative and insightful information on the actual shape variations of tools. Several statistically significant relationships are found between shape variation and use-wear attributes, though the results emphasize the large variability of the shape of the convergent tools, which, in general, does not show a strong direct association with technological features and function. This is in good agreement with the technological context of this chronological period, characterized by a wide diversity of non-standardized tools adapted to multipurpose functions for varied subsistence activities. © 2016 Chacón et al.

Leading examples have focused on fully-automatic identification using neural networks and supervised learning. This paper introduces an alternative semi-automatic or computer-aided approach. Such an approach reduces the workload associated with foram identification without the challenges of training set collection and fully-automatic recognition. The proposed method begins by photographing a collection of specimens sprinkled on a microscopy slide. Segmented images are then mapped into a canonical space where position, rotation, and scale are normalized. Specimens are clustered based on image similarity in the canonical space. A specialist then identifies the clusters by inspecting representative templates. Experimental results show that the identification effort can be reduced by 35%, yet the accuracy remains comparable to when every specimen is individually identified. Further reduction of effort was prevented by the significant variability of illumination direction in the canonical images. These results encourage further work on a computer-aided approach to foram identification.

These advocate a correlation with Holocene glacial records for the Colorado Front Range (Benedict, 1981, 1985). The archaeological potential of the Kersey fill, the Kuner strath, and the Hardin fill depends upon their age and sediment context. The oldest and most extensive terrace is the Kersey fill. The position of cultural components on the Kersey terrace implies an association of older Paleoindian sites (11,500–10,000 B.P.) with channel banks and bars on the terrace, younger Paleoindian sites (<10,000 B.P.) with terrace margins near the river, and Archaic and younger sites with eolian deposits on the terrace. An association of Clovis components with both Kersey alluvium and adjacent eolian dune fields indicates that eolian deposition began prior to 11,000 B.P. and that sediment availability influenced early Holocene eolian deposition. Examination of 150 cores and 75 backhoe test units along an 8‐km study corridor demonstrates that Paleoindian sites are not as abundant on the Kersey terrace as previous researchers have proposed. Although the incision of the Kuner strath began earlier than 9600 B.P., we propose that its greatest potential is to yield cultural components that postdate ca. 7250 B.P. In turn, the Hardin fill may yield cultural components dating to the Kuner abandonment (ca. 6380 B.P.). However, Hardin sediment and soil records recommend that this fill terrace's highest potential is to yield in situ cultural components dating from ca. 1900 to 120 B.P. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Here, we describe and demonstrate a geographic information systems-based lithic morphometric research (GLiMR) software approach. GLiMR accurately and rapidly handles a sequence of ArcGIS procedures to extract geometric morphometric data from 2D and 3D scan files that are impractical to record by hand, opening new doors to the analysis of lithic artifacts. GLiMR generates three main types of geometric properties: shape data, topographic data, and domain aggregate data. These data can be extracted in ways that support other analyses of artifact form, including generalized Procrustes analysis, principal components analysis, and cluster analyses. We illustrate the use of GLiMR by presenting a basic case study that compares the geometric morphometry ofWestern Stemmed Tradition projectile points found in two cache features at Idaho’s Cooper’s Ferry site and from other sites in the Columbia River Plateau region of the Pacific Northwest. Cluster analyses of the generalized Procrustes analysis of 3D landmarks from Cooper’s Ferry cache points fail to separate the two caches from one another on the basis of their geometric morphometric attributes. We interpret these results to suggest that these stemmed projectile points were probably created by persons who shared a specific set of technological production guidelines for the manufacture of Western Stemmed Tradition projectile points. Cluster analyses indicate that Cooper’s Ferry Western Stemmed Tradition projectile points can be morpho-metrically separated from stemmed points found at other regional sites; however, significant overlaps were seen among stemmed projectile points from the Pilcher Creek site, which may suggest the existence of contemporaneous information sharing networks or macroband territorial movements. © W.

Ritchie and his successor, Robert E. Funk. For five decades, their investigations defined the research framework for late Pleistocene occupations of eastern New York. In so doing, their research influenced interpretations of Paleoindian lifeways in glaciated regions that extend beyond New York, including the eastern Great Lakes, New England, and the Canadian Maritimes. In recent years, new information has come to light on the environmental setting and landscape evolution of late Pleistocene New York, providing a better basis for understanding the physical contexts for postglacial human colonization after circa 13,000 cal BP. As well, new insights (and persistent questions) on systematics and chronology cast a different light on published data for Paleoindian sites and point finds in New York (Bradley et al. 2008; Lothrop et al. 2011). Coupled with recent discoveries and analyses, this allows us to reconsider what we think we know about how the late Pleistocene peoples colonized, and then adapted to, the dynamic deglacial landscapes of eastern New York. In this review we discuss (1) late Pleistocene landscapes, (2) scenarios for human colonization, and (3) Paleoindian settlement, subsistence, and technology for the Hudson Valley and vicinity. We also consider possible roles of the Hudson Valley and the Champlain lowlands in peopling of the Far Northeast. Our geographic focus on eastern New York includes the Mohawk- Hudson drainage basin, adjacent upland provinces, and, to a lesser extent, the Champlain Basin. To complement this study area, we also draw on data from adjoining regions. In particular, we consider the eastern New York data in relation to the broader glacial landscapes extending north and east, collectively referred to elsewhere as the New England-Maritimes (Bradley et al. 2008; Lothrop et al. 2011; Spiess et al. 1998) but referenced in this volume as the Far Northeast. As we discuss below, most site- based evidence for Paleoindian occupation in eastern New York consists of early fluted point occupations, by default defining our primary focus. Our chronological framework relies on Bradley et al. (2008), distinguishing Early Paleoindian, Middle Paleoindian, and Late Paleoindian over the time span of circa 12,900-10,000 cal BP. Unless otherwise noted, all age and date references are based on calibrated radiocarbon dates and calendar years before present (Fiedel 1999).

Their descendents and later Paleoindian migrants spread throughout Colorado's plains and mountains, adapting to diverse landforms and the changing climate. In this new volume, Robert H. Brunswig and Bonnie L. Pitblado assemble experts in archaeology, paleoecology-climatology, and paleofaunal analysis to share new discoveries about these ancient people of Colorado. The editors introduce the research with scientific context. A review of seventy-five years of Paleoindian archaeology in Colorado highlights the foundation on which new work builds, and a survey of Colorado's ancient climates and ecologies helps readers understand Paleoindian settlement patterns. Eight essays discuss archaeological evidence from Plains to high Rocky Mountain sites. The book offers the most thorough analysis to date of Dent-the first Clovis site discovered. Essays on mountain sites show how advances in methodology and technology have allowed scholars to reconstruct settlement patterns and changing lifeways in this challenging environment. Colorado has been home to key moments in human settlement and in the scientific study of our ancient past. Readers interested in the peopling of the New World as well as those passionate about the methods and history of archaeology will find new material and satisfying overviews in this book. © 2007 by University Press of Colorado.

On the other hand, the use of quantitative characters (i.e. measurements) has been often neglected or underestimated in characterization and identification of fossil teeth of selachians. Here we show that, employing a robust methodological protocol based on principal component and discriminant analyses on a sample of 175 isolated fossil teeth of lamniform sharks, the traditional morphometrics can be useful to support and complement the classic taxonomic identification made on qualitative features. Furthermore, we show that discriminant analysis can be successfully useful to assign indeterminate isolated shark teeth to a certain taxon. Finally, the degree of separation of the clusters might be used to predict functional and probably also phylogenetic signals in lamniform shark teeth. However, this needs to be tested in the future employing teeth of more extant and extinct lamniform sharks and it must be pointed out that this approach does not replace in any way the qualitative analysis, but it is intended to complement and support it. © 2017 Marramà, Kriwet.

Lithic analysts have questioned two types of triangle, Levanna and Madison, as valid analytic units as they are quantifiably indeterminate when measured using caliper methods such as length and width. The geometric morphometric analysis here takes outline data from a previously studied collection of projectile points and uses elliptical Fourier harmonics analysis combined with principal components and discriminant functions tests to objectively define and separate the two types of projectile point. The result is a bimodal distribution of types that conforms to the traditional typological classification system for the region, in contrast to recent scholarship that conflates the two types into one. This study describes a high-resolution technique that offsets the inherent drawbacks of subjective, coarse-grained measurement approaches to projectile point characterization and comments on the study of typology as a whole. © 2015.","Geometric morphometrics; Late Woodland Period; Measurement theory; Northeastern North America; Triangle points; Typology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944727062

In North America, studies of morphological variation in projectile points have provided important insights into migration and interactions of human groups as early as 12–13 kya. Using new approaches to 3D imaging and morphometric analysis, we here quantify bifacial asymmetry among early North American projectile point styles to better understand changes in knapping technique and cultural transmission. Using a sample of 100 fluted bifaces of Clovis and post-Clovis styles in the eastern United States ca. 13,100–9,000 cal BP (i.e., Clovis, Debert-Vail, Bull Brook, Michaud-Neponset/Barnes, and Crowfield), we employed two different approaches for statistical shape analysis: our previously presented method for analysis of 2D flake scar contours, and a new approach for 3D surface analysis using spherical harmonics (SPHARM). Whereas bifacial asymmetry in point shape does not vary significantly across this stylistic sequence, our measure of asymmetric flake scar patterning shows temporal variation that may signify the beginning of regionalization among early New World colonists.",,"Article; cultural factor; materials handling; morphometry; North America; North American; Pleistocene; quantitative analysis; social interaction; stone analysis; three dimensional imaging; tool use; evolution; human; migration; social behavior; Biological Evolution; Human Migration; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; North America; Social Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023182450

Current ideas on the geologic, chronologic, and environmental context of the Paleoindian occupation of the region are based on decades of research by many individuals, but no single investigator has been more directly involved and made more substantive contributions to this geoarchaeological research than Vance Haynes. He was the first and still remains one of the few geoscientists to systematically investigate the stratigraphy and geochronology of Paleoindian sites (and late Pleistocene and early Holocene settings in general) throughout the region. In particular, his work at the Hell Gap site, Wyoming, provided the first comprehensive Paleoindian geochronology for the Northern Great Plains, and his initial investigations at the Clovis site, New Mexico, resulted in the first well-dated Paleoindian chronology for the Southern Great Plains. More broadly, his study of the southwestern ""alluvial chronology"" (1968) is a classic study in regional late Quaternary stratigraphy and environmental reconstructions, a landmark in understanding semiarid alluvial systems, and a stratigraphic and geochronologic model specifically oriented toward geoarchaeology. More than 30 years later, the Paleoindian geoarchaeology and geochronology of the Great Plains that Vance worked out, though much refined (largely through his own efforts), still holds and is the basic framework within which we continue to work. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347938656
