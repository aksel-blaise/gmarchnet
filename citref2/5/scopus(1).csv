Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

This type of symmetry is called object symmetry and is distinguished from matching symmetry, in which two separate structures exist as mirror images of each other, one on each body side. We explain a method for partitioning the total shape variation of landmark configurations with object symmetry into components of symmetric variation among individuals and asymmetry. This method is based on the Procrustes superimposition of the original and a reflected copy of each landmark configuration and is compatible with the two-factor ANOVA model customary in studies of fluctuating asymmetry. We show a fully multivariate framework for testing the effects in the two-factor model with MANOVA statistics, which also applies to shapes with matching symmetry. We apply the new methods in a small case study of pharyngeal jaws of the Neotropical cichlid fish Amphilophus citrinellus. The analysis revealed that the symmetric component of variation in the pharyngeal jaws is dominated by the contrast between two alternative trophic morphs in this species and that there is subtle but statistically significant directional asymmetry. Finally, we provide some general recommendations for morphometric studies of symmetric shapes.","Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological variation; Procrustes superimposition; Shape analysis; Symmetry","symmetry; Amphilophus citrinellus; Animalia; Cichlidae; Procrustes; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036807802

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

We propose an approach to investigate the role of development for morphological asymmetry by means of morphometric methods. Our approach combines geometric morphometrics with the two-way ANOVA customary for conventional analyses of fluctuating asymmetry and can discover localized features of shape variation by examining the patterns of covariance among landmarks This approach extends the notion of form used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry from collections of distances between morphological landmarks to an explicitly geometric concept of shape characterized by the configuration of landmarks. We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings of tsetse files (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring of young and old females. The morphological landmarks differed markedly in their degree of variability, but multivariate patterns of landmark covariation identified by principal component analysis were generally similar between fluctuating asymmetry (within-individual variability) and variation among individuals. Therefore, there is no evidence that special developmental processes control fluctuating asymmetry. We relate some of the morphometric patterns to processes known to be involved in the development of fly wings.","Developmental stability; Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Glossina palpalis; Procrustes analysis; Shape; Tsetse flies; Wing veins","developmental biology; fluctuating asymmetry; instability; methodology; morphometry; Diptera; Glossina palpalis; Glossinidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031731745

This was a cross-sectional, retrospective study of archived material with the sample aged 2 years and older having a uniform age and sex distribution. Developing teeth from 72 prenatal and 104 postnatal skeletal remains of known age-at-death were examined from collections held at the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the Natural History Museum, London, UK (M 91, F 72, unknown sex 13). Data were also collected from dental radiographs of living individuals (M 264, F 264). Median stage for tooth development and eruption for all age categories was used to construct the atlas. Tooth development was determined according to Moorrees et al. (J Dent Res 42 (1963a) 490-502; Am J Phys Anthropol 21 (1963b) 205-213) and eruption was assessed relative to the alveolar bone level. Intraexaminer reproducibility calculated using Kappa on 150 teeth was 0.90 for 15 skeletal remains of age <2 years, and 0.81 from 605 teeth (50 radiographs). Age categories were monthly in the last trimester, 2 weeks perinatally, 3-month intervals during the first year, and at every year thereafter.

One contributory tradition is the multivariate analysis of covariance matrices originally developed as biometrics and now dominant across a broad expanse of applied statistics. This approach, couched solely in the linear geometry of covariance structures, ignores biomathematical aspects of the original measurements. The other tributary emphasizes the direct visualization of changes in biological form. However, making objective the biological meaning of the features seen in those diagrams was always problematical; also, the representation of variation, as distinct from pairwise difference, proved infeasible. To combine these two variants of biomathematical modeling into a valid praxis for quantitative studies of biological shape was a goal earnestly sought though most of this century. That goal was finally achieved in the 1980s when techniques from mathematical statistics, multivariate biometrics, non-Euclidean geometry and computer graphics were combined in a coherent new system of tools for the complete regionalized quantitative analysis of landmark points together with the biomedical images in which they are seen. In this morphometric synthesis, correspondence of landmarks (biologically labeled geometric points, like ""bridge of the nose"") across specimens is taken as a biomathematical primitive. The shapes of configurations of landmarks are defined as equivalence classes with respect to the Euclidean similarity group and then represented as single points in David Kendall's shape space, a Riemannian manifold with Procrustes distance as metric. All conventional multivariate strategies carry over to the study of shape variation and covariation when shapes are interpreted in the tangent space to the shape manifold at an average shape. For biomathematical interpretation of such analyses, one needs a basis for the tangent space compatible with the reality of local biotheoretical processes and explanations at many different geometric scales, and one needs graphics for visualizing average shape differences and other statistical contrasts there. Both of these needs are managed by the thin-plate spline, a deformation function that has an unusually helpful linear algebra. The spline also links the biometrics of landmarks to deformation analysis of the images from which the landmarks originally arose. This article reviews the history and principal tools of this synthesis in their biomathematical and biometrical context and demonstrates their usefulness in a study of focal neuroanatomical anomalies in schizophrenia.",,"anatomy; animal; article; biometry; computer graphics; human; mathematics; methodology; theoretical model; Anatomy; Animals; Biometry; Computer Graphics; Humans; Mathematics; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030095282

AD 250 to 850) marshal a vast array of evidence from Maya iconography and hieroglyphic writing, as well as archaeological findings, to argue that the Classic Maya developed a coherent approach to the human body that we can recover and understand today. The authors open with a cartography of the Maya body, its parts and their meanings, as depicted in imagery and texts. They go on to explore such issues as how the body was replicated in portraiture; how it experienced the world through ingestion, the senses, and the emotions; how the body experienced war and sacrifice and the pain and sexuality that were intimately bound up in these domains; how words, often heaven-sen, could be embodied; and how bodies could be blurred through spirit possession. From these investigations, the authors convincingly demonstrate that the Maya conceptualized the body in varying roles, as a metaphor of time, as a gendered, sexualized being, in distinct stages of life, as an instrument of honor and dishonor, as a vehicle for communication and consumption, as an exemplification of beauty and ugliness, and as a dancer and song-maker. Their findings open a new avenue for empathetically understanding the ancient Maya as living human beings who experienced the world as we do, through the body. © 2006 University of Texas Press.

Although referrals for nonsynostotic plagiocephaly (NSP) have increased in recent years, the prevalence, natural history, and determinants of the condition have been unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and natural history of NSP in normal infants in the first 2 years of life and to identify factors that may contribute to the development of NSP. Methods. Two hundred infants were recruited at birth. At 6 weeks, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months, and 2 years, the head circumference shape was digitally photographed, and head shape was quantified using custom-written software. At each age, infants were classified as cases when the cephalic index was ≥93% and/or the oblique cranial length ratio was ≥106%. Neck rotation and a range of infant, infant care, socioeconomic, and obstetric factors were assessed. Results. Ninety-six percent of infants were followed to 12 months, and 90.5% were followed to 2 years. Prevalence of plagiocephaly and/or brachycephaly at 6 weeks and 4, 8, 12, and 24 months was 16.0%, 19.7%, 9.2%, 6.8%, and 3.3% respectively. The mean cephalic index by 2 years was 81.6% (range: 72.0%-102.6%); the mean oblique cranial length ratio was 102.6% (range: 100.1%-109.4%). Significant univariate risk factors of NSP at 6 weeks include limited passive neck rotation at birth, preferential head orientation, supine sleep position, and head position not varied when put to sleep. At 4 months, risk factors were male gender, firstborn, limited passive neck rotation at birth, limited active head rotation at 4 months, supine sleeping at birth and 6 weeks, lower activity level, and trying unsuccessfully to vary the head position when putting the infant down to sleep. Conclusions. There is a wide range of head shapes in infants, and prevalence of NSP increases to 4 months but diminishes as infants grow older. The majority of cases will have resolved by 2 years of age. Limited head rotation, lower activity levels, and supine sleep position seem to be important determinants.

A model is presented for developmental interactions that occur during ontogeny between the brain and the cranial base and neurocranium, and between the neurobasicranial complex (NBC) and the face. The model is tested using exocranial and radiographic measurements of adult crania sampled from five geographically and craniometrically diverse populations. The results indicate that while variations in the breadth, length and flexion of the cranial base are mutually independent, only the maximum breadth of the cranial base (POB) has significant effects on overall cranial proportions, largely through its interactions with brain volume which influence NBC breadth. These interactions also have a slight influence on facial shape because NBC width constrains facial width, and because narrow-faced individuals tend to have antero-posteriorly longer faces relative to facial breadth than wide-faced individuals. Finally, the model highlights how integration between the cranial base and the brain may help to account for the developmental basis of some morphological variations such as occipital bunning. Among modern humans, the degree of posterior projection of the occipital bone appears to be a consequence of having a large brain on a relatively narrow cranial base. Occipital buns in Neanderthals, who have wide cranial bases relative to endocranial volume, may not be entirely homologous with the morphology occasionally evident in Homo sapiens.","Basicranium; Cranium; Integration; Neurocranium; Occipital bun; Skull","morphometry; skull; Crania; Hominidae; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034070524

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the basicranium matures in size before the face, it has been suggested that the form of the basicranium might have ontogenetic knock-on effects on that of the face. However, although sequential spatially organized maturation of size is well described in the cranium, the maturation of skull shape is not. Knowledge of the maturation of shape is important, nevertheless, because it is claimed that the early determination of the spatial configuration of basicranial components, where the facial skeleton attaches, is relevant in the spatio-temporal ontogenetic cascade from basicranium to face. This paper examines the ontogeny of various components of the human skull in 28 individuals from the longitudinal Denver Growth Study. Sixty-six landmarks and semilandmarks were digitized on 228 X-rays and analysed using geometric morphometric methods. Bootstrapped confidence intervals for centroid size support previous studies suggesting a supero-inferior gradient of growth maturation (size over time), while developmental maturation (shape over time) is more complex. A sequence of shape maturation is described, in which the earliest structure to mature in shape was the midline cranial base (7-8 years), followed by the lateral cranial floor (11-12), midline neurocranium (9-10) and facial and mandibular structures (15-16). The absolute ages of shape maturation of the latter three depended on the criterion of maturity used, which was not the case for the basicranial components. Additionally, ontogenetic dissociations were found between the maturation of size and shape of the midline cranial base and lateral floor, possibly underlining its role as structural 'interface'between brain and facial ontogeny. These findings imply potential for bidirectional developmental influences between the lateral cranial floor and the face until about 11-12 years. The findings are discussed with regard to their relevance for palaeoanthropology and especially the evolutionary and developmental bases of skull morphological variation. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Basicranium; Cranial base; Craniofacial ontogeny; Denver Growth Study; Modularity; Procrustes; Sliding semilandmarks","adolescent; adult; anatomical variation; article; bone development; bone maturation; bone radiography; bone structure; child; confidence interval; craniofacial development; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; evolutionary developmental biology; female; human; male; mandible; ontogeny; paleoanthropology; priority journal; skull base; Adolescent; Aging; Bone Development; Cephalometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Face; Facial Bones; Humans; Infant; Longitudinal Studies; Photography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750380914

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549154351

New technology for data collection and new methods and software for analysis are widely available and have led to numerous applications in plants and animals, including humans. This review summarizes the concepts and morphometric methods for studying asymmetry of shape and size. After a summary of mathematical and biological concepts of symmetry and asymmetry, a section follows that explains the methods of geometric morphometrics and how they can be used to analyze asymmetry of biological structures. Geometric morphometric analyses not only tell how much asymmetry there is, but also provide information about the patterns of covariation in the structure under study. Such patterns of covariation in fluctuating asymmetry can provide valuable insight about the developmental basis of morphological integration, and have become important tools for evolutionary developmental biology. The genetic basis of fluctuating asymmetry has been studied from empirical and theoretical viewpoints, but serious challenges remain in this area. There are many promising areas for further research that are only little explored at present. © 2015 by the authors.","Developmental instability; Directional asymmetry; Evo-devo; Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological integration; Procrustes superimposition; Shape; Symmetry",,Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934755420

Two of these samples are artificially deformed (anteroposterior [AP] and circumferential [C] types). Measurements taken from lateral radiographs demonstrated that alternative forms of the cranial base angle (N‐S‐Ba, planum angle, planum sphenoidale to plane of the clivus and PANG angle, planum sphenoidale to basion‐sella plane) and the orbital and OANG angles (orbital roof to plane of the clivus and basion‐sella plane, respectively) of both deformed groups increased while the angle S‐Ba‐O decreased significantly with respect to the undeformed (N) sample. Changes in the AP group are largely due to anteroinferior displacement of the basion‐sella plane. Similar changes in group C are amplified by this group's posterosuperior frontal migration. This migration results in a relatively shallow orbit at the orbital plate/frontal squama interface. Unlike the deformation experienced by the external vault plates, the basion‐sella plane orientation remains stable with respect to the Frankfort Horizontal. Additionally, nasal region measurements such as maximum nasal aperture breadth and nasal height were largely stable between each deformed group and the undeformed group. However, facial (bimaxillary and bizygomatic), basicranial, cranial, and frontal breadths decreased significantly from group AP to group N to group C. Thus, gross morphological facial changes between each undeformed group and the control group are largely accounted for by dimensional changes in peripheral structures. These results stress the importance of the dynamic interrelationship between the cranial vault and base in the development of the craniofacial complex.

We test the hypothesis that fronto‐occipital artificial reshaping of the neurocranial vault results in specific changes in the cranial base and face. Fronto‐occipital reshaping results from the application of pads or a cradle board which constrains cranial vault growth, limiting growth between the frontal and occipital and allowing compensatory growth of the parietals in a mediolateral direction. Two skeletal series including both normal and artificially modified crania are analyzed, a prehistoric Peruvian Ancon sample (47 normal, 64 modified crania) and a Songish Indian sample from British Columbia (6 normal, 4 modified). Three‐dimensional coordinates of 53 landmarks were measured with a diagraph and used to form 9 finite elements as a prelude to finite element scaling analysis. Finite element scaling was used to compare average normal and modified crania and the results were evaluated for statistical significance using a bootstrap test. Fronto‐occipitally reshaped Ancon crania are significantly different from normal in the vault, cranial base, and face. The vault is compressed along an anterior‐superior to posterior‐inferior axis and expanded along a mediolateral axis in modified individuals. The cranial base is wider and shallower in the modified crania in the face is foreshortened and wider with the anterior orbital rim moving inferior and posterior towards the cranial base. The Songish crania display a different modification of the vault and face, indicating that important differences may exist in the morphological effects of fronto‐occipital reshaping from one group to another. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

A review of ethnohistorical sources in conjunction with a human osteological study of cranial shape modification offers original data regarding diversity in Tiwanaku society, which was situated in the southern Andes from ca. AD 500-1100. The study sample includes 412 individuals from the site of Tiwanaku, surrounding sites in the Tiwanaku and Katari valleys, and Tiwanaku-affiliated sites in the Moquegua valley of southern Peru. A distinct regional pattern is clear in the ways in which head form was modified. In the Moquegua valley, solely fronto-occipital modification was employed, while in the Katari valley a distinctly different, annular modification was practiced. In contrast, individuals interred in the capital city of Tiwanaku displayed both head form styles. These results suggest that diverse groups of people from neighboring areas were drawn to the Tiwanaku capital in the highlands, and cranial shape modification was involved in symbolic boundary maintenance at the juncture of two distinct environmental niches, the precise location of the capital site of Tiwanaku. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J. Phys. Anthropol. 79:253-267; Kohn et al. [1993] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 90:147-158). It can be argued that diverging observations partly result from methodological constraints. The present study compares samples of intentionally deformed and undeformed human crania, using elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA), a morphometric approach which has been shown to be particularly appropriate for characterizing the shape of two-dimensional outlines and associated shape changes. We improve the standard EFA approach by adding a preliminary orientation of the outlines following the rotation parameters of a Procrustes superimposition, using multiple homologous landmarks called control points. The results confirm that circumferentially deformed skulls exhibit modifications of the basioccipital region, together with increased anterior and inferior facial projection. However, the degree to which basioccipital flattening is modified in circumferentially deformed Peruvians was found to be less marked than changes observed in the face. Some of the modifications observed here can be related to morphological trends existing in the population from which our sample was taken. The observation of other modifications may be subject to methodological constraints of standard morphometric approaches. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Homologous control points; Intentional deformation; Outline analysis; Procrustes registration","article; elliptic fourier analysis; face malformation; finite element analysis; Fourier analysis; human; morphometrics; Peru; skull base; skull malformation; Adult; American Native Continental Ancestry Group; Anthropology, Physical; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Fourier Analysis; Humans; Male; Reference Values; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041418176

We also examine whether mandibular dimorphism is linked to dimorphism of dental development. Dense CT-derived mandibular meshes of 84 females and 75 males, ranging from birth to adulthood, were analyzed using geometric morphometric methods. On the basis of the specimen's chronological ages and mineralization stages of the deciduous and permanent teeth, we compute dental age as proxy for dental development by the additive conjoint measurement method. By birth, males have, on average, more advanced age-specific shapes than females. However, sex differences decrease quickly as females catch up via a different association between shape and size. This leads to an almost complete reduction of sexual dimorphism between the ages of 4 and 14. From puberty to adulthood, males are characterized by allometric shape changes while the shape of the female mandible continues to change even after size has ceased to increase. Dimorphism of dental maturation becomes visible only at puberty. Sexual dimorphism, concentrated at the ramus and the mental region during the earliest ontogenetic stages and again at adulthood, is not associated with the development of the teeth. At puberty there is a simultaneous peak in size increase, shape development, and dental maturation likely controlled by the surge of sex hormones with a dimorphic onset age. We argue that the infant and adult dimorphism of the mental region may be associated with the development of supralaryngeal structures. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","mandible; ontogeny; sexual dimorphism; shape; teeth","adolescent; adult; article; bone mineralization; child; computer assisted tomography; deciduous tooth; female; groups by age; human; infant; male; mandible; morphometrics; newborn; onset age; ontogeny; postnatal development; preschool child; puberty; school child; sex difference; tooth; tooth development; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Dentition; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Mandible; Principal Component Analysis; Sex Characteristics; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Tooth; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956209491

However, artificial vault deformation has been suggested to be the cause of 'archaic' characters such as frontal recession in key fossil Australian crania. We use log-log plots of cranial arc versus chord measurements and we score nonmetric traits often thought to be associated with artificial deformation to make systematic comparisons across groups and deformation types to identify universal consequences of artificial deformation. Based on our large comparative sample (n=588) apparatus-deformed crania have flatter frontals and occipitals and usually more angulated parietals in the sagittal plane than undeformed crania, regardless of deformation type. Fossil Australian samples exhibit evidence of both undeformed and deformed individuals. The sample from Coobool Creek provides evidence that undeformed individuals had more rounded frontals than recent Australians. However, many individuals from Coobool Creek, Kow Swamp, and Nacurrie exhibit modification of one or more cranial contours. The Kow Swamp individuals in particular plot with deformed crania from all regions. In addition, the frequency of hyperostotic traits such as bregmatic eminence, metopic and sagittal keels in H. sapiens is influenced by both artificial deformation and pathological hypervascularity/hyperostosis. Thus it is unwise to use cranial contours and these nonmetric traits to infer genetic relatedness between Fossil Australians and Indonesian H. erectus.","Cranial contours; Homo erectus; Origin of H. sapiens","cranium; evolution; Australia; Indonesia; Animalia; Crania; Hominidae; Homo erectus; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033081055

For reliable sex estimation, a posterior probability greater than 0.95 was considered to be the classification threshold: below this value, estimates are considered indeterminate. By providing free software, we aim to develop an even more disseminated method for sex estimation. Materials and Methods: Ten metric variables collected from 2,040 ossa coxa of adult subjects of known sex were recorded between 1986 and 2002 (reference sample). To test both the validity and reliability, a target sample consisting of two series of adult ossa coxa of known sex (n = 623) was used. The DSP2 software (Diagnose Sexuelle Probabiliste v2) is based on Linear Discriminant Analysis, and the posterior probabilities are calculated using an R script. Results: For the reference sample, any combination of four dimensions provides a correct sex estimate in at least 99% of cases. The percentage of individuals for whom sex can be estimated depends on the number of dimensions; for all ten variables it is higher than 90%. Those results are confirmed in the target sample. Discussion: Our posterior probability threshold of 0.95 for sex estimate corresponds to the traditional sectioning point used in osteological studies. DSP2 software is replacing the former version that should not be used anymore. DSP2 is a robust and reliable technique for sexing adult os coxae, and is also user friendly. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bone dimensions; diagnose sexuelle probabiliste; os coxae; population nonspecific standards; sexing","adult; diagnosis; discriminant analysis; female; forensic anthropology; hip; human; major clinical study; male; pelvic girdle; probability; reliability; sex determination; software; validation process; validity; anatomy and histology; forensic anthropology; pelvic girdle; procedures; sex determination; software; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Male; Pelvic Bones; Sex Determination by Skeleton; Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024497726

The data obtained confirm that they were used as musical rasps called omichicahuaztli in Nahuatl and also provide new interpretations of their acquisition, manufacture, and abandonment processes. Cut marks indicate that the bones were taken from fresh cadavers of at least eight individuals, possibly sacrificial victims. Regarding manufacture and use of these instruments, important variations are observed and suggest that different persons could have manipulated them. Finally, it is possible to demonstrate that most of the instruments were broken intentionally prior to being buried with numerous individuals. Regarding the context in which the omichicahuaztli were used, it is interesting to point out some characteristics of the associated skeletons. Among male skulls, the high incidence of traumatic lesions that may have occurred in warlike context strongly suggests that many of the buried individuals were warriors. This association may indicate that Tarascan omichicahuaztli, similar to those of the Aztec, were used in funerary ceremonies dedicated to dead warriors.

Development of the function, based on a sample of deformed and undeformed crania from the Philippines, required visual classification of the sample into deformed and undeformed groups. Working from the observation that deformed crania display flattened frontal and occipital regions, the sample was seriated based on degree of flattening; classification was based on the results of this seriation. The discriminant function, calculated using curvature indices, required only six simple measurements: arc and chord measurements for the frontal (glabella to bregma), parietals (bregma to lambda) and occipital (lambda to opisthion). The function was designed to be conservative, in that a deformed cranium may be classified as undeformed, but the opposite should not occur. Our function classified the undeformed crania with 100% accuracy and deformed crania with 76.9% accuracy, for a total of 91.9% agreement with visual classification. In order to evaluate whether the function is applicable for samples from outside the Philippines, a double blind test was conducted with a large sample of deformed and undeformed crania from a broad geographical and temporal range. For this sample, the function agreed with visual classification in 89.7% of cases; 98.8% of undeformed crania were correctly classified, while deformed crania were identified with 73.7% accuracy. These results demonstrate the utility of the new discriminant function for the classification of artificially deformed crania from diverse contexts.

The skeletal evidence of this head form, which was accomplished by combining compression cradleboards with constricting horizontal wraps (tabular erect type in its pseudo-circular variety), is rare and predates A.D. 250 in all cases.

The discussion explores the possible evolving social and religious roles of this emblematic body modification, I argue that Olmecoid head modification was a syncretic cultural adoption, since it was just one of many expressions of a deeply embedded Preclassic tradition, still practiced centuries after the demise of Olman's societies themselves. The visible effect of the artificial pear-shaped heads most likely reflected gradual shifting ideological schemes, probably emulating early versions of the Maya Maize God, given the resemblance to Preclassic period renderings of this supernatural force. © 2010 by the Society for American Archaeology.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869228288

In northern Chile it was extensively done during five thousand years by populations which inhabited the Coast and Valleys from Arica. In spite of the importance that the study of this practice has had in anthropological research, biocultural remains such as hear, mould and textils preclude the morphometric analyses commonly performed onto the clean skull. In order to avoid these limitations and to know the pattern of skull shape variation, geometric morphometric methody and craneoficial radiographic technics were applied on non deformed and intentionally deformed samples of Arica's archaeological populations. As a control sample radiographs obtained from modern Chileans were used. Radiographic and geometric morphometric evidences here presented show that: (1) variation of skull shape components of intentionally deformed crania is explained by both the force and the direction of the deforming devices originally applied, (2) intentional deformation affects anatomical landmarks located in the neurocrania as well the face, (3) there would be a morphological continuity among populations representatives of Archaic and Agro-ceramic cultural traditions. The role of geometric morphometric and radiographic technics to asses the problem of intentional cranial deformation in archaeological and modern human populations as well as the discrepancy between our results and the results obtained by means of the traditional morphometric methods are discussed.","Arica-Chile; Geometric morphometrics; Intentional cranial deformation; Radiography",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746113110

In this study a skull, not previously reported as artificially modified, was reassessed by radiography to provide further insight on this subject.

In this group, one result of cra‐dleboarding was bilateral or asymmetric flattening of the posterior occipital. We test whether cradleboarding had significant effects on the morphology of the cranial vault, cranial base, and face. Additionally, we examine associations between direction of flattening and asymmetric craniofacial growth. A skeletal sample of Hopi from the Old Walpi site includes both nonmodified (N = 43) and modified individuals (N = 39). Three‐dimensional coordinates of 53 landmarks were obtained using a diagraph. Thirty‐six landmarks were used to define nine finite elements in the cranial vault, cranial base, and face. Finite element scaling was used to compare average nonmodified individuals, with averages of bilaterally, right, and left modified individuals. The significance of variation among “treatment” groups was evaluated using a bootstrap test. Pearson product‐moment correlations test the association of asymmetry with direction of modification. Hopi cradleboarding has a significant effect on growth of the cranial vault, but does not affect morphology of the cranial base or face. Bilateral flattening of the cranial vault leads to decreased length and increased width of the cranial vault. Flattening of the right or left cranial vault results in ipsilaterally decreased length and width coupled with a corresponding increased length and width on the contralateral side of the cranial vault.

For those ancient societies that staged head shaping, these cultural correlates may be ascertained by examining cranial shapes together with other data sets from the archaeological record. Studies of skulls modified for cultural reasons also provide important clues for understanding principles in neural growth and physiopathological variation in cranial expansion. This paper focuses on head shaping techniques in Mesoamerica, where the practice was deeply rooted and widespread before the European conquest. It provides a comprehensive review of the Mesoamericanistic research on shaping techniques, implements and taxonomies. An up-dated, interdisciplinary examination of the physiological implications and the cultural meanings of artificially produced head shapes in different times and culture areas within Mesoamerica leads to a discussion of the scope, caveats, and future directions involved in this kind of research in the region and beyond.","Ancient mesoamerica; Artificial cranial vault modification; Bioarchaeology; Body modifications; Interdisciplinary anthropology; Osteology","archeology; body modification; Central America; history; human; pathology; physical anthropology; review; skull; Anthropology, Physical; Archaeology; Body Modification, Non-Therapeutic; Central America; History, Ancient; Humans; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869232672

The direction of normal cranial growth is altered through the application of external forces. In this study, three types of ACM from north-central Peru (posterior flattening, bilobed and circumferential) were analysed using standard craniometric techniques. The aim was to determine the effects of these forms of ACM on craniofacial morphology, and the extent to which different types of ACM could be distinguished from one another and unmodified crania on the basis of these measurements. Significant differences between artificially modified and unmodified crania, and between different types of ACM, were demonstrated in cranial vault shape for all types. Significant differences in facial morphology were found only in the bilobed group compared with the unmodified crania. Canonical variates analysis (discriminant analysis) confirmed that major differences between modification types and unmodified crania were in measurements and angles of the cranial vault. While the results show some similarities to previous studies, they add to the variability in the patterns and extent of differences documented to date. It is suggested, based on these results and visual observations, that interpopulation variation in ACM within major modification categories may explain some of the variability in results between studies, an explanation which has previously received insufficient recognition but which remains to be tested since varied methodology between studies may also be a contributory factor. While previous studies have often sought to generalise about the effects of ACM, the examination of the differences between populations even within major ACM categories may offer new insight into cultural variation in modification techniques between populations and the nature of craniofacial development. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Artificial cranial modification; Craniometrics; Peru",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954639465

This paper provides a quantitative method, based on multiple dimensions and discriminant function analysis, by which to assign skulls not only into discrete categories: deformed or not, but also by type: annular or tabular. A series of prehispanic, adult, human crania (n=469) from archaeological sites in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru represented by both normal and artificially deformed specimens, provide craniometric data for four measurements across the vault: maximum cranial length, breadth and height and the frontal chord. These data are used to develop three indices which in turn are used to compute two discriminant functions. Results are plotted on a territorial map whereby the type of deformity can be determined. When these methods were applied to a comparative cranial sample of nondeformed skulls from South America, 100% of the samples was found to be nondeformed. When these methods were applied to the samples which were subjectively classified a priori by the first author as nondeformed, 81.3% of the samples were found to be nondeformed. This study demonstrates the value of a more objective and quantitative method by which to classify artificial cranial deformation, and thus provides a new approach. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Annular; Craniometrics; Cultural cranial modification; Discriminant function; Head moulding; South America; Tabular",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880580474

We analyzed a sample of 28 adult skulls from archaeological sites from the province of Neuquén. For comparative purposes we also included 12 samples from Pampean Region and northeast and center of Patagonia. The variation in artificial deformation was described using coordinates of landmarks and semilandmarks in 2 dimensions within the context of geometric morphometric techniques. The results indicate the existence of a marked temporal variation in artificial cranial deformations in Neuquén. Sites dated ca 4000 years BP are characterized by compression in the occipital region and frontal bones. This morphology is also found in burials from northern Atlantic coast of Patagonia and South East Pampean Region with chronologies post 3300 years BP. The individuals dated within the final late Holocene show morphologies are characterized by the expansion of the frontal bone and that compression in lambda. The same type of deformation is contemporaneously found in Chubut River and South Pampa. In summary, our results allow to extend the temporal depth of the artificial deformation in northern Patagonia to the limit of late-middle Holocene, highlighting the supra-regional geographic distribution of cranial deformations.","Bioarchaeology; Cranial deformation; Neuquén",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955525857

The phenomenon of artificial skull and teeth modifications identified at ancient burials sites in Armenia clearly points to the emergence of social complexity and class differentiation, and hence the need for social distinction, which in this case was accomplished through the use of body markings.

In the Migration Period of Europe (4th± 7th century AD) the practice of intentional cranial modification was common among several nomadic groups, but was strongly associated with the Huns from the Carpathian Basin in Hungary, where modified crania are abundant in archaeological sites. The frequency of modified crania increased substantially in the Mtskheta region of Georgia in this time period, but there are no records that Huns settled here. We compare the Migration Period modified skulls from Georgia with those from Hungary to test the hypothesis that the Huns were responsible for cranial modification in Georgia. We use extended eigenshape analysis to quantify cranial outlines, enabling a discriminant analysis to assess group separation and identify morphological differences. Twenty-one intentionally modified skulls from Georgia are compared with sixteen from Hungary, using nineteen unmodified crania from a modern population as a comparative baseline. Results indicate that modified crania can be differentiated from modern unmodified crania with 100% accuracy. The Hungarian and Georgian crania show some overlap in shape, but can be classified with 81% accuracy. Shape gradations along the main eigenvectors indicate that the Hungarian crania show little variation in cranial shape, in accordance with a two-bandage binding technique, whereas the Georgian crania had a wider range of variation, fitting with a diversity of binding styles. As modification style is a strong signifier of social identity, our results indicate weak Hunnic influence on cranial modification in Georgia and are equivocal about the presence of Huns in Georgia. We suggest instead that other nomadic groups such as Alans and Sarmatians living in this region were responsible for modified crania in Georgia. © 2017 Mayall et al.

While previous studies have enriched our understanding of these practices among prehistoric Andean populations, the introduction of 3D surface scanners and geometric morphometric methods in archaeology enable us to examine head-shaping practices in novel ways. In this pilot study, we used a NextEngine 3D Laser Surface Scanner to generate high resolution models of artificially modified crania from four archaeological sites dating to the Archaic (2300–1600 BCE), Formative (500 CE), late Middle Horizon/early Late Intermediate period (LIP) (750–1100 CE) in Chile and late LIP crania (circa 1350 CE) from central, highland Peru. Landmarks were recorded on the 3D digital models of crania and these data were analyzed to assess variation in vault shape within and between the samples. Results of the PCA analysis showed graphical separation of the annular, tabular erect, and some tabular oblique types even when gross morphological assessments proved challenging. We documented marked variation within the general modification type traditionally identified as tabular oblique, which suggests more detailed classifications within this type are needed. We also investigated how standardized (i.e., similar) particular cranial modification types were at each site, and results show that the coastal sites of Morro 1 and Playa Miller 7, and the highlands Huari-Vegachayoc Moqo site show higher levels of standardization than the other four samples. This study highlights the utility of 3D imaging and geometric morphometric methods for straightforward, objective assessments of cranial modification and levels of standardization within sites and within particular modification types. This has implications for understanding the broader social and cultural significance of this practice, such as whether there were shared cultural norms about how a head should be modified, which could have led to highly uniform modification practices and head shapes in the Andes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","3D laser scanning; Andean archaeology; Archaeological science; Bioarchaeology; Biocultural anthropology; Cranial vault modification; Social identity",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84999026105

It is not related to rites of passage, but to different social status in a group. Therefore, the deformed cranium is an expression of individual affirmation and affiliation to a given social group. Osteological material from Pasamayo (AD 1200-1450), a cemetery in central coast of Peru, was analyzed to test whether individuals presenting different types of cranial deformation (interpreted as a sign of different social status) present differences in health status. Three types of cranial deformation were observed and five osteological markers (cribra orbitalia, cranial trauma, antemortem tooth loss, dental caries, and periodontal cavities) related to health status were analyzed in 78 crania. No significant differences were found in terms of these osteological markers among females in relation to the different types of cranial deformation. However, males presenting occipital deformation had significantly less caries and periodontal cavities than the others. Moreover, males presenting fronto-lambdoid deformation had more antemortem tooth loss than the other males. Therefore, although different types of cranial deformation can be potentially associated to distinct social status, differences in health status could only be observed in the male sample.","Archaeology; Bioanthropology; Palaeopathology; Pasamayo",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902185877

It has been postulated that the Huns used a two-bandage cranial binding technique to differentiate themselves from surrounding nomadic groups, including those from Georgia. This study examines this hypothesis by comparing Migration Period (4th to 7th century AD) juvenile crania, which retain strong impressions of bindings, with adult modified crania from Hungary and Georgia. Materials and Methods: Twelve surface landmarks and 251 semi-landmarks were used to study ontogenetic trajectories in 9 juvenile and 16 adult modified skulls from 8 Hungarian sites and 21 adult skulls from two Georgian sites. Generalized Procrustes analysis, linear regression of Procrutes distance on dental age and log centroid size, and warping the principal components (PCs) in shape space helped to identify cranial shape changes. Results: The PCs provide significant separation of the juvenile and adult groups from Georgia and Hungary. Variation in modified cranial shape was limited in Hungary compared to Georgia. There was stronger correlation between juvenile and adult modified cranial shape in Hungary than in Georgia. Warping along the first axis reveals the trajectory from marked flattening of the frontal and occipital regions in juveniles to diminished flattening in the same regions in adult crania, corresponding with one binding. Another depression extending from the post-bregmatic region to the temporal region, similarly strong in juveniles but diminishing in adults, marks the second binding. Discussion: Hungarian crania were modified with two bindings with limited shape variation, whereas the Georgian crania had greater variation in shape being also modified with antero-posterior bindings. The findings from this study alongside contemporary historical sources help to understand the role of intentional cranial modification as a mark of social identity among nomads in the Migration Period of Europe. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Georgia; Hungary; intentional cranial modification; ontogenetic allometry; procrustes superimposition","adult; allometry; article; frontal cortex; human; Hungary; juvenile; linear regression analysis; occipital cortex; skull; social status; temporal lobe; tooth; adolescent; anatomy and histology; body modification; cephalometry; child; ethnology; female; Georgia (republic); history; Hungary; infant; male; migration; newborn; pathology; physical anthropology; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Body Modification, Non-Therapeutic; Cephalometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Georgia (Republic); History, Medieval; Human Migration; Humans; Hungary; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Skull; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041349823

After the Spanish Conquest, this practice was prohibited and has fallen in disuse, until becoming an interesting research topic for bioarcheology, physical anthropology, and ethnohistory, or, at least, this is what is commonly thought. Our research began by asking this point. Is the cranial shaping tradition really extinct? To address this query, we conducted questionnaires and interviews in the current territory of Guatemala. After that, we compared results with the recent bioarchaeological discussions and found an excellent analogy that glimpsed the continuation and transformation of this prehispanic tradition.","Contemporary Maya; Corporal anthropology; Embodiment; Guatemala; Head shaping",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037104828
