Such investigations are often analysed inappropriately, notably by using correlation coefficients. The use of correlation is misleading. An alternative approach, based on graphical techniques and simple calculations, is described, together with the relation between this analysis and the assessment of repeatability. © 1986.",,"clinical research; diagnosis; human; priority journal; statistics; technique; theoretical study; validity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908219488

It is more problematic to apply model-based methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images. © 1995 Academic Press.

As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

Design: inter-rater and intra-rater (between-scans and between-days) reliability. Subjects: Ten normal subjects (five male) aged 22-58 years. Method: The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the anterior tibial muscle group was measured using real-time ultrasonography. Main outcome measures: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ICCs, and Bland and Altman method for assessing agreement, which includes calculation of the mean difference between measures (d̄), the 95% CI for d̄, the standard deviation of the differences (SD(diff)), the 95% limits of agreement and a reliability coefficient. Results: Inter-rater reliability was high, ICC (3,1) was 0.92 with a 95% CI of 0.72→0.98. There was reasonable agreement between measures on the Bland and Altman test, as d̄ was -0.63 cm2, the 95% CI for d̄ was -1.4→0.14 cm2, the SD(diff) was 1.08 cm2, the 95% limits of agreement -2.73→1.53 cm2 and the reliability coefficient was 2.4. Between-scans repeatability was high, ICCs (1,1) were 0.94 and 0.93 with 95% CIs of 0.8→0.99 and 0.75→0.98, for days 1 and 2 respectively. Measures showed good agreement on the Bland and Altman test: d̄ for day 1 was 0.15 cm2 and for day 2 it was -0.32 cm2 the 95% CIs for d̄ were -0.51→0.81 cm2 for day 1 and -0.98→0.34 cm2 for day 2; SD(diff) was 0.93 cm2 for both days, the 95% limits of agreement were -1.71→2.01 cm2 for day 1 and -2.18→1.54 cm2 for day 2; the reliability coefficient was 1.80 for day 1 and 1.88 for day 2. The between-days ICC (1,2) was 0.92 and the 95% CI 0.69→0.98. The d̄ was -0.98 cm2, the SD(diff) was 1.25 cm2 with 95% limits of agreement of -3.48→1.52 cm2 and the reliability coefficient 2.8. The 95% CI for d̄ for a (-1.88→-0.08 cm2) and the distribution graph showed a bias towards a larger measurement on day 2. Conclusions: The ICC and Bland and Altman tests are appropriate for analysis of reliability studies of similar design to that described, but neither test alone provides sufficient information and it is recommended that both are used.",,"adult; article; clinical article; female; human; intermethod comparison; male; muscle growth; reliability; statistical analysis; tibialis anterior muscle; ultrasound; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Observer Variation; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Rehabilitation; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031849485

In this study, samples of modern and prehistoric hunter–gatherers and agriculturalists are used to test the hypothesis that there are systematic differences in patterns of tooth wear related to major differences in subsistence and food preparation. Flatness of molar wear is compared for five groups of hunter–gatherers (N = 298) and five groups of early agriculturalists (N = 365). Hunter–gatherers are predicted to develop flatter molar wear due to the mastication of tough and fibrous foods, whereas agriculturalists should develop oblique molar wear due to an increase in the proportion of ground and prepared food in the diet. A method is presented for the quantitative measurement and analysis of flatness of molar wear. Comparisons of wear plane angle are made between teeth matched for the same stage of occlusal surface wear, thus standardizing all groups to the same rate of wear. Agriculturalists develop highly angled occlusal wear planes on the entire molar dentition. Their wear plane angles tend to exceed hunter–gatherers by about 10° in advanced wear. Wear plane angles are similar within subsistence divisions despite regional differences in particular foods. This approach can be used to provide supporting evidence of change in human subsistence and to test dietary hypotheses in hominoid evolution.

Often the degrees and kinds of tooth wear vary from population to population. This variability is possibly related to certain material aspects of culture such as diet, food preparation techniques and tool usage. In order to learn more about these relationships, extensive cross cultural comparisons must be made. This paper reports on a study of dental attrition among skeletal remains of North American Indians from three areas: California, the Southwest and the Valley of Mexico. A method of comparing worn teeth of these populations was devised so several characteristics of the teeth and supporting bone could be examined by population. This study showed significant differences in type and degree of wear among the three groups as well as differences between sexes within each population. A positive correlation between tooth wear and cultural factors was found. Dietary specialization and division of labor appear to be responsible for the degree and type of wear found in this sample. Further studies of this type are planned to expand the sample size and, if the new data support these correlations, valuable information about human–environmental relationships can be gained.

The measurements of cortical bone are taken on extant and fossil specimens with and without attached matrix, and the dental specimens studied include a sample of 12 extant human molars. Local CT numbers (representing X‐ray, attenuation) are used to determine the exact position of the boundaries of a structure. Using this technique most studied dimensions, including four of human molar enamel thickness, could be obtained from CT scans with a maximum error range of ±0.1 mm.

Among the principal difficulties in these evaluations is the absence of discrete, discernible, and comparable anatomical structures for rigorous quantitative assessment. Previous research has addressed either internal crown surface features (such as cusps and fossae) or the morphology of the crown outline. In the present paper, we integrate both types of information in the examination of morphological variation of lower P4s (n = 96) among various fossil hominin species with an emphasis on genus Homo. We use a set of 34 2D landmarks combining coordinate data from four classical dental landmarks on the occlusal surface and 30 sliding semilandmarks of the crown outline. Our results indicate that external shape variation is closely related to the configuration of the occlusal morphological features and influenced by dental size. The external and internal shapes of P4 are polymorphic but still useful in depicting a primitive-derived gradient. The primitive pattern seems to have been an asymmetrical contour with a mesially displaced metaconid, development of a bulging talonid, and a broad occlusal polygon. The trend toward dental reduction during the Pleistocene produced different morphological variants with a reduced occlusal polygon and decreased lingual occlusal surface in later Homo species. Homo heidelbergensis/neanderthalensis have fixed plesiomorphic traits in high percentages, whereas in modern humans a symmetrical outline with a centered metaconid and talonid reduction evolved. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Usually these analyses have been performed by means of classic morphometric methods, including the measurement of relative cusp areas or the angles defined between cusps. Although these studies have provided valuable information for the morphological characterization of some hominin species, we believe that the analysis of this particular tooth could be more conclusive for taxonomic assignment. In this study, we have applied geometric morphometric methods to explore the morphological variability of the upper first molar (M1) across the human fossil record. Our emphasis focuses on the study of the phenetic relationships among the European middle Pleistocene populations (designated as H. heidelbergensis) with H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, but the inclusion of Australopithecus and early Homo specimens has helped us to assess the polarity of the observed traits. H. neanderthalensis presents a unique morphology characterized by a relatively distal displacement of the lingual cusps and protrusion in the external outline of a large and bulging hypocone. This morphology can be found in a less pronounced degree in the European early and middle Pleistocene populations, and reaches its maximum expression with the H. neanderthalensis lineage. In contrast, modern humans retain the primitive morphology with a square occlusal polygon associated with a round external outline. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, freehand 3D ultrasound (US) provides a non-invasive method for digitising bone surfaces in the operating theatre that enables a much greater region to be sampled compared with conventional direct-contact (i.e., pointer-based) digitisation techniques. In this paper, we describe how these approaches can be combined to simultaneously generate and register a patient-specific model of the femur and pelvis to the patient during surgery. In our implementation, a statistical deformation model (SDM) was constructed for the femur and pelvis by performing a principal component analysis on the B-spline control points that parameterise the freeform deformations required to non-rigidly register a training set of CT scans to a carefully segmented template CT scan. The segmented template bone surface, represented by a triangulated surface mesh, is instantiated and registered to a cloud of US-derived surface points using an iterative scheme in which the weights corresponding to the first five principal modes of variation of the SDM are optimised in addition to the rigid-body parameters. The accuracy of the method was evaluated using clinically realistic data obtained on three intact human cadavers (three whole pelves and six femurs). For each bone, a high-resolution CT scan and rigid-body registration transformation, calculated using bone-implanted fiducial markers, served as the gold standard bone geometry and registration transformation, respectively. After aligning the final instantiated model and CT-derived surfaces using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, the average root-mean-square distance between the surfaces was 3.5 mm over the whole bone and 3.7 mm in the region of surgical interest. The corresponding distances after aligning the surfaces using the marker-based registration transformation were 4.6 and 4.5 mm, respectively. We conclude that despite limitations on the regions of bone accessible using US imaging, this technique has potential as a cost-effective and non-invasive method to enable surgical navigation during CAOS procedures, without the additional radiation dose associated with performing a preoperative CT scan or intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging. However, further development is required to investigate errors using error measures relevant to specific surgical procedures. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Pulp/root ration, tooth length, pulp/tooth length ratio, pulp/tooth area and pulp/root width ratios at three different levels were computed. Pearson's correlation coefficients between age and these variables showed that the ratio between pulp and tooth area correlated best with age (r2 = 0.85). Stepwise multiple regression models yielded a linear relationship between pulp/root width at mid-root level and chronological age and a linear relationship when pulp/tooth area was compared to age. Statistical analysis indicated that these two variables explain 84.9% of variations in estimated chronological age. The median of the absolute value of residual errors between actual and estimated ages was less than four years.","Age determination by teeth; Dental pulp; Forensic odontology; Forensic science; Pulp/tooth area; Stepwise linear regression","adult; age determination; aged; aging; article; canine tooth; computer aided design; dentistry; digital radiography; female; forensic science; human; male; odontology; priority journal; regression analysis; statistical analysis; tooth; tooth pulp; Adolescent; Adult; Age Determination by Teeth; Aged; Cuspid; Dental Pulp; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Forensic Dentistry; Humans; Italy; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odontometry; Tooth Root",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1542317071

Philippine Negritos, Jomon/Ainu, and Western Eurasians have small teeth, while East/Southeast Asians and Polynesians are intermediate in overall tooth size. Second, in terms of odontometric shape factors, world extremes are Europeans, aboriginal New World populations, and to a lesser extent, Australians. Third, East/Southeast Asians share similar dental features with sub-Saharan Africans, and fall in the center of the phenetic space occupied by a wide array of samples. Fourth, the patterning of dental variation among major geographic populations is more or less consistent with those obtained from genetic and craniometric data. Fifth, once differences in population size between sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, South/West Asia, Australia, and Far East, and genetic drift are taken into consideration, the pattern of sub-Saharan African distinctiveness becomes more or less comparable to that based on genetic and craniometric data.

After the analysis of the lower second premolar and the upper first molar crown shapes, we apply the same technique to lower first premolar morphology. Our results show a clear distinction between the morphology seen in earlier hominin taxa such as Australopithecus and African early Homo, as well as Asian H. erectus, and more recent groups such as European H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens. The morphology of the earlier hominins includes an asymmetrical outline, a conspicuous talonid, and an occlusal polygon that tends to be large. The morphology of the recent hominins includes a symmetrical outline and a reduced or absent talonid. Within this later group, premolars belonging to H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis tend to possess a small and mesiolingually-displaced occlusal polygon, whereas H. sapiens specimens usually present expanded and centered occlusal polygons in an almost circular outline. The morphological differences among Paranthropus, Australopithecus, and African early Homo as studied here are small and evolutionarily less significant compared to the differences between the earlier and later homin taxa.

There are alternatives, particularly measurements at the cervix of the tooth, where the crown joints the root, and measurements along a diagonal axis in molars, that are much less affected by wear. These would allow a wider range of specimens to be included, e.g., in the study of dental reduction in Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic Homo sapiens. In addition, they would allow the little-worn teeth of children to be compared directly with well-worn teeth in adults. These alternatives, however, have been little used, and as yet there have not been any studies of the repeatability with which they can be measured, or of the extent to which they are related to the more usual crown diameters. The present study is based on a group of unworn teeth, where direct comparisons could be made between the alternative measurements, which are not much affected by wear, with the usual crown diameters, which are very much affected. In an interobserver-error study of this material, cervical and diagonal measurements could be recorded as reliably as the usual crown diameters. The buccolingual cervical measurement was strongly correlated with the normal bucclingual crown diameter in all teeth, whereas the mesiodistal cervical measurement was highly correlated with the normal mesiodistal crown diameter in incisors and canines, but less so in premolars and molars. The molar diagonal measurements showed high correlations with all other measurements. Crown areas (robustness index) calculated from the usual diameters were strongly correlated with crown areas calculated from cervical measurements, and crown areas calculated from molar diagonals were strongly correlated with both other areas. Despite the long usage of the more usual maximum crown diameters, the alternative dental measurements could be measured just as reliably, could record similar information about tooth crown size, and would be better measures for the worn dentitions seen in archaeological and fossil material. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cervical diameters; Crown diameters; Dental measurements","archeology; article; dentition; fossil; incisor; measurement; molar tooth; premolar tooth; tooth crown; tooth size; Fossils; Humans; Odontometry; Paleodontology; Research Design; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-15244361522

One of the reasons for this controversy is that there is as yet no reliable, non-destructive in vitro metod for assessing mineral loss in bleached teeth. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible demineralization effect of 10% carbamide peroxide bleaching agent on enamel and dentine non-destructively. μCT images were obtained of 12 human molar tooth sections. These sections had 10% carbamide peroxide applied for eight hours a day over a period of 15 days. Further tomographic images were obtained and the mineral content prior to and post bleaching assessed. A total of 144 regions were evaluated using the image processing language available in the work station. The application of 10% carbamide peroxide was found to cause demineralization of the enamel extended to a depth of 50 μm below the enamel surface (Paired t-test, p<0.05). This study confirmed that μCT was indeed a highly suitable method for assessing mineral content of dental enamel after bleach application. It is recommended that application of bleaching agents should be carefully considered in patients susceptible to caries and tooth wear. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The results are then extrapolated to the population as a whole, overlooking the inherent and large interpatient variability in bone quality and geometry. This paper describes the creation of a three dimensional, statistical, finite element analysis (FEA) ready model of the femur using principal component analysis. To achieve this a registration scheme based on elastic surface matching and a mesh morphing algorithm has been developed. This method is fully automated enabling registration and generation of high resolution models. The variation in both geometry and material properties was extracted from 46 computer tomography scans and captured by the statistical model. Analysis of mesh quality showed this was maintained throughout the model generation and sampling process. Reconstruction of the training femurs showed 35 eigenmodes were required for accurate reproduction. A set of unique, anatomically realistic femur models were generated using the statistical model, with a variation comparable to that seen in the population. This study illustrates a methodology with the potential to generate femur models incorporating material properties for large scale multi-femur finite element studies. © 2009 IPEM.","Femur; Material property; Principal component analysis; Registration; Statistical model","Bone quality; Computational studies; Computer tomography; Eigen modes; Elastic surfaces; Femur; Finite element analysis; Finite-element study; High-resolution models; Human femora; Material property; Mesh morphing; Mesh quality; Model generation; Orthopaedic implants; Registration scheme; Sampling process; Statistical modelling; Statistical models; Bone; Extraction; Finite element method; Materials properties; Mesh generation; Population statistics; Quality control; Three dimensional; Tomography; Principal component analysis; algorithm; article; bone density; bone structure; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; femur; finite element analysis; mathematical analysis; physical chemistry; physical model; priority journal; statistical analysis; statistical model; structure analysis; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Automation; Elasticity; Female; Femur; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Anatomic; Models, Statistical; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Surface Properties",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-72449144548

Using a subset of clinical knee MRI data from the osteoarthritis initiative (OAI), the objectives of this study were to (1) utilize SSM to compactly and efficiently describe variability in knee subchondral bone surface geometry and (2) determine the efficacy of SSM and rigid body transformations to distinguish between patients who are not expected to develop osteoarthritis (i.e. Control group) and those with clinical risk factors for OA (i.e. Incidence group). Quantitative differences in femur and tibia surface geometry were demonstrated between groups, although differences in knee joint alignment measures were not statistically significant, suggesting that variability in individual bone geometry may play a greater role in determining joint space geometry and mechanics.

This reduces the size of samples available for study. The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) is the developmental precursor and primary contributor to the morphology of the unworn outer enamel surface, and its morphology is only affected after considerable attrition. In this paper, we explore whether the form of the EDJ can be used to distinguish between the mandibular molars of two southern African fossil hominins: Paranthropus (or Australopithecus) robustus and Australopithecus africanus. After micro-computed tomographic scanning the molar sample, we made high-resolution images of the EDJ and used geometric morphometrics to compare EDJ shape differences between species, in addition to documenting metameric variation along the molar row within each species. Landmarks were collected along the marginal ridge that runs between adjacent dentine horns and around the circumference of the cervix. Our results suggest that the morphology of the EDJ can distinguish lower molars of these southern African hominins, and it can discriminate first, second, and third molars within each taxon. These results confirm previous findings that the EDJ preserves taxonomically valuable shape information in worn teeth. Mean differences in EDJ shape, in particular dentine horn height, crown height, and cervix shape, are more marked between adjacent molars within each taxon than for the same molar between the two taxa. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Design: X-ray microtomographic and 3D x-ray microscopy. Setting: UK University, 2001. Materials and methods: X-ray microtomographic measurements of the extent of hypomineralisation in two affected molars and two contralateral controls extracted from the same patient. Results: The control molars were visibly normal. The affected molars showed hypomineralised yellow opaque enamel with regions of breakdown. X-ray microtomographic images showed; a 20% reduction in mineral concentration of affected enamel (most cases involved full enamel thickness); hypomineralised enamel had a mineral concentration gradient opposite to that of normal enamel; regions of hypomineralisation distributed randomly throughout affected teeth, (apart from cervical region which was less severely affected). Conclusions: The pattern of mineral concentration suggests a disturbance during the maturation process. Differences in susceptibility of the ameloblasts during different stages of dental development may explain the asymmetric distribution of the defects. Topical fluoride applications may help promote post eruption maturation of the surface layer in these teeth. The use of fissure sealants and adhesive materials appears to prevent further breakdown.",,"fluoride; ameloblast; article; bone mineralization; caries prevention; contrast enhancement; controlled study; enamel; fluoridation; human; human tissue; incisor; molar tooth; tooth development; tooth eruption; tooth extraction; tooth radiography; Child; Dental Enamel Hypoplasia; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Microradiography; Molar; Tooth Calcification",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-2942538605

Five hydroxyapatite phantoms (sintered pellets of hydroxyapatite powder) with densities ranging from 1.52 to 3.14 g/cm3 were used as calibration standards for each scan. Three-dimensional image reconstruction enabled MD gradients throughout the lesion to be quantified using an MD calibration equation derived from hydroxyapatite phantoms. Background noise generated during the measurement of MD was reduced using a Gaussian filter. Results: Gaussian filter reduced the signal-to-noise ratio (standard deviation) significantly while the basic MD information (average value) remained intact. The mineral gradients through the WSLs examined were compared and are discussed in terms of existing literature. The MD of sound enamel, apparent intact surface layer of WSL, and lowest level of WSL was found to be 2.65-2.89 g/cm3, 2.23-2.58 g/cm3 and 1.48-2.03 g/cm3, respectively. Our MD results are comparable with other studies. Conclusions: X-ray micro-tomography is a sensitive in vitro technique capable of characterising and quantifying MD of small non-cavitated WSLs. This method has a promising potential for future carious and quantitative remineralisation studies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methodology: The specimens used in this study were 10 maxillary first premolar teeth (five males and five females) obtained from patients in three age groups, namely in their twenties (20s), forties (40s) and sixties (60s). Each specimen was imaged by a micro-CT to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure. Then, using the reconstructed images, the morphological characteristics of the pulp cavity, the volume ratio at the horn region, the floor region and the overall region of the pulp chamber and the diameters of the buccal and lingual orifices of the root canals were compared between the three age groups. Results: The mesio-distal widths and the heights of the pulp cavity decreased with age. The volume ratio and the diameter of the root canal orifices also decreased. The decrease in volume was not constant but showed a large decrease between the 20s and the 40s, compared to those of 40s to 60s. Conclusions: Morphological features of the pulp cavity of maxillary first premolar teeth in different age groups were observed three dimensionally using micro-CT. Decreases in pulp cavity size and shape with age were clarified using a three-dimensional technique.","Maxillary lirst premolar; Micro-CT; Morpho-metrical changes with age; Pulp cavity; Root canal orifices; Three-dimensional observation","adult; age; aged; aging; analysis of variance; article; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; female; groups by age; height; human; human tissue; image processing; image reconstruction; male; maxilla; microradiography; morphology; mouth; observation; pathology; patient; premolar tooth; radiography; three dimensional imaging; tomography; tongue; tooth pulp; tooth root canal; Adult; Aged; Aging; Analysis of Variance; Bicuspid; Dental Pulp Cavity; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Maxilla; Microradiography; Middle Aged; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0842333856

York St, Denver, CO, United States","Subject-specific finite element models developed from imaging data provide functional representation of anatomical structures and have been used to evaluate healthy and pathologic knee mechanics. The creation of subject-specific models is a time-consuming process when considering manual segmentation and hexahedral (hex) meshing of the articular surfaces to ensure accurate contact assessment. Previous studies have emphasized automated mesh mapping to bone geometry from computed tomography (CT) scans, but have not considered cartilage and soft tissue structures. Statistical shape modeling has been proposed as an alternative approach to develop a population of subject models, but still requires manual segmentation and registration of a training set. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to develop an efficient, integrated mesh-morphing-based segmentation approach to create hex meshes of subject-specific geometries from scan data, to apply the approach to natural femoral, tibial, and patellar cartilage from magnetic resonance (MR) images, and to demonstrate the creation of a statistical shape model of the knee characterizing the modes of variation using principal component analysis. The platform was demonstrated on MR scans from 10 knees and enabled hex mesh generation of the knee articular structures in approximately 1.5 h per subject. In a subset of geometries, average root mean square geometric differences were 0.54 mm for all structures and in quasi-static analyses over a range of flexion angles, differences in predicted peak contact pressures were less than 5.3% between the semi-automated and manually generated models. The integrated segmentation, mesh-morphing approach was employed in the efficient development of subject-specific models and a statistical shape model, where populations of subject-specific models have application to implant design evaluation or surgical planning. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Thus, there is potential for fossil taxa, particularly fossil hominins, to be distinguished at similar taxonomic levels using molar crown morphology. Unfortunately, due to occlusal attrition, the original crown morphology is often absent in fossil teeth, and this has limited the amount of shape information used to discriminate hominin molars. The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) of molar teeth preserves considerable shape information, particularly in regard to the original shape of the crown, and remains present through the early stages of attrition. In this study, we investigate whether the shape of the EDJ of lower first and second molars can distinguish species and subspecies of extant Pan. Micro-computed tomography was employed to nondestructively image the EDJ, and geometric morphometric analytical methods were used to compare EDJ shape among samples of Pan paniscus (N = 17), Pan troglodytes troglodytes (N = 13), and Pan troglodytes verus (N = 18). Discriminant analysis indicates that EDJ morphology distinguishes among extant Pan species and subspecies with a high degree of reliability. The morphological differences in EDJ shape among the taxa are subtle and relate to the relative height and position of the dentine horns, the height of the dentine crown, and the shape of the crown base, but their existence supports the inclusion of EDJ shape (particularly those aspects of shape in the vertical dimension) in the systematic analysis of fossil hominin lower molars. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Micro-computed tomography; Sliding semilandmarks; Tooth morphology","article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; dentin; discriminant analysis; enamel; micro-computed tomography; molar tooth; morphometrics; nonhuman; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; subspecies; tooth crown; Animals; Classification; Dental Enamel; Dentin; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Molar; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Principal Component Analysis; Species Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Pan; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Pan troglodytes troglodytes; Pan troglodytes verus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349089351

To better understand the social and community structure of this setting, an intracemetery biological distance analysis was conducted. Metric and nonmetric observations were recorded in both deciduous and permanent dentitions (n = 266) to explore phenotypic patterning of individuals interred within individual buildings. Specifically, this study tests the hypothesis that individuals within houses and house groupings represent family units and the social structure of Çatalhöyük was largely biological-kin based. Multivariate and univariate statistical procedures were applied to phenotypic dental data. Results indicate that inclusion for interment within a house was only minimally related to biological affinity. Moreover, the site does not appear to be organized into larger, biologically related neighborhoods of houses. These findings suggest that Çatalhöyük may not have been a kin-based society, largely because membership within a house cemetery was not solely defined on the basis of biological affinity, such as in a family group. Rather, it appears that social structure was centered on the house as the unifying social principle. The choice for interment location may have transcended biological lines thereby creating an alternate and more fluid definition of ""kin."" These findings can be used to understand the transition to settled life and biological patterning in this Neolithic community.

However, many evolutionary analyses based on dental traits overlook the constraints that limit dental evolution. These constraints are diverse, ranging from developmental interactions between the individual elements of a homologous series (the whole dentition) to functional constraints related to occlusion. This study evaluates morphological integration in the hominin dentition and its effect on dental evolution in an extensive sample of Plio- and Pleistocene hominin teeth using geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods. Results reveal that premolars and molars display significant levels of covariation; that integration is stronger in the mandibular dentition than in the maxillary dentition; and that antagonist teeth, especially first molars, are strongly integrated. Results also show an association of morphological integration and evolution. Stasis is observed in elements with strong functional and/or developmental interactions, namely in first molars. Alternatively, directional evolution (and weaker integration) occurs in the elements with marginal roles in occlusion and mastication, probably in response to other direct or indirect selective pressures. This study points to the need to reevaluate hypotheses about hominin evolution based on dental characters, given the complex scenario in which teeth evolve. © 2012 The Author(s).

Design: Tooth rods (∼2 mm × 2 mm) were removed from the mid-buccal region of 11 deciduous molars. Three XMT slices were taken at 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mm from the amelocemental junction. The distribution and variation in mineral concentration of enamel were studied from the XMT images. Results: The mean mineral concentration for all the teeth was 2.81 (S.D. = 0.065) g cm-3. There was no notable difference in the mean mineral concentration values between the three XMT slices of each tooth. However, there was up to 8% variation between different teeth (2.69-2.92 g cm-3). Gradients of increasing mineral concentration from the amelodentinal junction (ADJ) to the external surface were found, ranging from 0.08 to 0.60 mg cm-3 μm-1 with a mean of 0.366 mg cm-3 μm-1. The mineral concentration gradients in the occlusal slices were steeper than those in the cervical slices. The difference in mineral concentration between the inner and outer enamel ranged from 1.5 to 8.7%. Conclusion: In view of the large variation in both the means and the gradients of mineral concentration in deciduous molars, the mineral distribution of each experimental tooth should be measured as baseline data in studies of caries progression. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A critical reading of morphometric discrimination studies of various kinds of organisms in recent years suggests that a review of procedures is warranted, particularly with regard to the kinds of assumptions being made. I will discuss the main concepts and methods used in problems of discrimination, first using conventional morphometric characters (measured distances between putatively homologous landmarks), and then using landmarks directly with geometric morphometric approaches. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-81155160093

It does this by focusing on 12 variables (nine dental and three mandibular) for which data are available about extant chimpanzees, modern humans and most extinct hominins. Previous analyses of this type have approached the interpretation of dental and gnathic function by focusing on the identification of the food consumed (i.e. fruits, leaves, etc.) rather than on the physical properties (i.e. hardness, toughness, etc.) of those foods, and they have not specifically addressed the role that the physical properties of foods play in determining dental adaptations. We take the available evidence for the 12 variables, and set out what the expression of each of those variables is in extant chimpanzees, the earliest hominins, archaic hominins, megadont archaic hominins, and an inclusive grouping made up of transitional hominins and pre-modern Homo. We then present hypotheses about what the states of these variables would be in the last common ancestor of the Pan - Homo clade and in the stem hominin. We review the physical properties of food and suggest how these physical properties can be used to investigate the functional morphology of the dentition. We show what aspects of anterior tooth morphology are critical for food preparation (e.g. peeling fruit) prior to its ingestion, which features of the postcanine dentition (e.g. overall and relative size of the crowns) are related to the reduction in the particle size of food, and how information about the macrostructure (e.g. enamel thickness) and microstructure (e.g. extent and location of enamel prism decussation) of the enamel cap might be used to make predictions about the types of foods consumed by extinct hominins. Specifically, we show how thick enamel can protect against the generation and propagation of cracks in the enamel that begin at the enamel-dentine junction and move towards the outer enamel surface. © 2008 The Author Journal compilation © 2008 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Biomechanics; Dentition; Enamel; Function; Mechanics","canine tooth; chimpanzee; cladistics; conference paper; dentin; dentition; dietary intake; enamel; evolution; extant species; extinct species; food intake; food processing; fossil hominin; fruit; hardness; human; hypothesis; incisor; last common ancestor; mandible; molar tooth; nonhuman; particle size; plant leaf; priority journal; tooth crown; tooth size; animal; diet; evolution; feeding behavior; fossil; histology; hominid; mandible; physiology; review; Pan; Animals; Dentition; Diet; Evolution; Feeding Behavior; Fossils; Hominidae; Mandible",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-45849127656

A 3-D elastic matching algorithm has been developed to use surface information for registering volumes. Surface extraction is performed in two steps: extraction of contours in 2-D image planes using active contours, and forming triangular patch surface models from the stack of 2-D contours. One volume is modeled as being deformed with respect to another goal volume. Correspondences between surfaces in the two image volumes are used to warp the deformed volume towards its goal. This process of contour extraction, surface formation and matching, and warping is repeated a number of times, with decreasing image volume stiffness. As the iterations continue the stretched volume is refined towards its goal volume.

Materials and Methods: The physical volume (Vw) of 24 bicuspids extracted for orthodontic purposes (16 were imaged with the I-CAT and 8 with the CB MercuRay) were determined using the water displacement technique. Corresponding pretreatment CBCT image data were uploaded into Amira 4.0 for segmentation and radiographic volume (Va). All measurements were performed twice by two observers. The statistical difference between Vw and Va was assessed using a paired t-test. The intraobserver and interobserver reliability were determined by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: The overall mean Vw of teeth specimens was 0.553 ± 0.082 cm3, while the overall mean Va was 0.548 ± 0.079 cm3 (0.529 ± 0.078 cm 3 for observer 1 and 0.567 ± 0.085 cm3 for observer 2). There were statistically significant differences between Va and Vw (P&lt;.05). Between observer 1 and observer 2, Va measurements were statistically significantly different (P &lt;.05). The interobserver and intraobserver correlation coefficient for Vw was high. Lastly, surface smoothing reduced the volume by 3% to 12%. Conclusions: In vivo determination of tooth volumes from CBCT data is feasible. The measurements slightly deviate from the physical volumes within -4% to 7%. Smoothing operations reduce volume measurements. Currently, no requirements for accuracy of volumetric determinations of tooth volume have been established. © 2010 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.","Cone-beam ct; Orthodontic; Radiographic; Segmentation; Tooth volume","adolescent; adult; article; computer interface; cone beam computed tomography; feasibility study; female; histology; human; image processing; male; methodology; observer variation; odontometry; organ size; pilot study; premolar tooth; radiography; statistics; validation study; Adolescent; Adult; Bicuspid; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Observer Variation; Odontometry; Organ Size; Pilot Projects; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449346186

This technique, widely developed in the medical field, allows the bi-dimensional, planar representation of some local morphometric properties, i.e., topographic thickness variation, of a three-dimensional object, such as a long bone shaft. Nonetheless, the use of morphometric maps is still limited in (paleo)anthropology, and their feasibility has not been adequately tested on fossil specimens. Using high-resolution microtomographic images, here we apply bi-dimensional virtual ""unrolling"" and synthetic thickness mapping techniques to compare cortical bone topographic variation across the shaft in a modern and a fossil human adult femur (the Magdalenian from Chancelade). We also test, for the first time, the possibility to virtually unroll and assess for dentine thickness variation in modern and fossil (the Neanderthal child from Roc de Marsal) human deciduous tooth roots. The analyses demonstrate the feasibility of using two-dimensional morphometric maps for the synthetic functional imaging and comparative biomechanical interpretation of cortical bone thickness variation in extant and fossil specimens and show the interest of using this technique also for the subtle characterization of root architecture and dentine topography. More specifically, our preliminary results support the use of virtual cartography as a tool for assessing to what extent internal root morphology is capable of responding to loading and directional stresses and strains in a predictable way. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cortical bone; Microtomography; Morphometric maps; Root dentine; Thickness variation","article; cortical bone; femur; fossil; human; image display; paleoanthropology; three dimensional imaging; tooth root; Adult; Child, Preschool; Dentin; Femur; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Organ Size; Paleodontology; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Tooth Root",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952774740

Morphological differences between group mean shapes and between the control mean and individual patients were calculated. Principal component analysis described anatomical variation. Among all femurs, the first six modes (or principal components) captured significant variations, which comprised 84% of cumulative variation. The first two modes, which described trochanteric height and femoral neck width, were significantly different between groups. The mean cam femur shape protruded above the control mean by a maximum of 3.3 mm with sustained protrusions of 2.5-3.0 mm along the anterolateral head-neck junction/distal anterior neck. SSM described variations in femoral morphology that corresponded well with areas prone to damage. Shape variation described by the first two modes may facilitate objective characterization of cam FAI deformities; variation beyond may be inherent population variance.

Here, we first document the evolutionary changes of root size and shape of the anterior upper and lower dentition in a broad chronological and geographical framework. We then use the size and shape differences between RMH and Neanderthals to classify several isolated teeth from Kebara cave and Steinheim, and to interpret the anterior tooth roots of the Tabun C2 mandible.Our samples comprise permanent mandibular and maxillary incisors and canines from early Homo, Neanderthals, as well as extant and fossil modern humans (N = 359). In addition to root length, we measured cervical root diameter and area, total root volume, root pulp volume and root surface area from μCT scans. We quantified root shape variation using geometric morphometrics.Our results show that Neanderthals have not only significantly larger anterior roots than RMH overall, but also different root shapes for each tooth type. In the context of the 'teeth-as-tools' hypothesis, this could be an adaptation to better sustain high or frequent loads on the front teeth.We demonstrate that the two isolated incisors stored with the Steinheim skull are very likely recent. Tabun C2 shows an anterior dentition similar in size and shape to Neanderthals while its molar roots are non-Neanderthal. Two of the five isolated teeth from Kebara are classified as Neanderthals.Interestingly, early modern humans overlap with Neanderthals and RMH in root size and shape. Anterior roots of the Lower and Middle Pleistocene specimens are at least as large as Neanderthals, suggesting that Neanderthals retained a primitive pattern, which should prompt caution in the assessment of the earliest forms of modern humans. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ancestral condition; Canines; Hypercementosis; Incisors; Micro-CT; Teeth-as-tools hypothesis","comparative study; dentition; evolution; fossil record; morphology; morphometry; Neanderthal; paleontology; Pleistocene; skull; taxonomy; tooth; Bavaria; Germany; Haifa [Israel]; Israel; Kebara Cave; Steinheim Basin; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875225022

The wear facets produced on the occlusal surfaces were clearly preserved on the dental stone casts and recorded the progress of enamel attrition from ages 6 to 18. These casts were photographed and traced by electronic planimetric methods that automatically recorded the location and size of wear facets on the first and second permanent molars. These areas of worn tooth surface were compared to the total tooth surface. The worn surface was regressed on age to calculate wear rates of each tooth. Discriminant analyses were also performed to determine the significance of dental attrition differences between the sexes at each age group. The total wear on each tooth was highly correlated with age as expected but females wore their teeth at a significantly higher rate than males. The mandibular molars wore more rapidly than maxillary teeth in both sexes. The discriminant analysis successfully grouped 91% of the cases according to age and sex. Pattern of wear, the location, and size of wear facets also differed between age groups and sex. The questions of why there is a difference between male and female wear or why there is greater wear on one arch or arch region have no ready answers. The differing rates and pattern of dental wear do suggest that arch shape and growth rates may be the answer though it has yet to be tested. However, the occlusal surface wear is useful for age estimation in a population and provides a record of shifting masticatory forces during growth.

While the GM toolkit has unparalleled power to quantify shape, its use in studies of functional morphology have been questioned. Here, we assess the state of the field of GM and provide an overview of the techniques available to assess shape, including aspects of visualization, statistical analysis, phylogenetic control, and more. Additionally, we briefly review the history of functional morphology and summarize the main tools available to the functional morphologist. We explore the intersection of geometric morphometrics and functional morphology and we suggest ways that we may be able to move forward in profitably combining these two research areas. Finally, this paper provides a brief introduction to the papers in this special issue and highlights the ways in which the contributing authors have approached the intersection of GM and functional morphology.

In accordance with their outer occlusal morphology, the specimens exhibit a set of derived internal features, such as thick to hyperthick enamel, an incomplete expression of the crest patterns at the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) level, a sharp EDJ topography. As a whole, these features differ from those expressed in some penecontemporaneous specimens/samples representing African H. erectus/ ergaster and H. heidelbergensis, as well as in Neanderthals, but occur in recent human populations.

Statistical models have largely focused on individual bones with application to implant sizing, bone fracture and osteoarthritis; however, in joint mechanics applications, the statistical models must consider the geometry of multiple structures of a joint and their relative position. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to develop a statistical shape and alignment modeling (SSAM) approach to characterize the intersubject variability in bone morphology and alignment for the structures of the knee, to demonstrate the statistical model's ability to describe variability in a training set and to generate realistic instances for use in finite element evaluation of joint mechanics. The statistical model included representations of the bone and cartilage for the femur, tibia and patella from magnetic resonance images and relative alignment of the structures at a known, loaded position in an experimental knee simulator for a training set of 20 specimens. The statistical model described relationships or modes of variation in shape and relative alignment of the knee structures.

Microcomputed tomography (microCT) is a fundamental tool, since it offers the opportunity to get high quality morphological information with high spatial resolution. We carried out the set-up of an experimental microCT system able to examine paleobiological samples. The equipment can operate on small objects (size up to 3 cm) with a nominal spatial resolution of 30 μm, allowing their 3D volume reconstruction and morphometric analysis. This approach represents a forefront technique in paleobiological studies, successfully employed only in a limited number of advanced research centers. A specific program of microCT analysis has been planned on a sample of human and non-human fossil primate dentitions, in order to assess the specific nature of a number of tooth lesions (e.g. caries versus abrasion).

One of the drawbacks of the approach is, however, the need to establish a set of dense correspondences between examples of similar structures, across a training set of images. Often this is achieved by locating a set of ‘landmarks’ manually on each of the training images, which is time-consuming and subjective for 2D images, and almost impossible for 3D images. This has led to considerable interest in the problem of building a model automatically from a set of training shapes. We extend previous work that has posed this problem as one of optimising a measure of model ‘quality’ with respect to the set of correspondences. We define model ‘quality’ in terms of the information required to code the whole set of training shapes and aim to minimise this description length. We describe a scheme for representing the dense correspondence maps between the training examples and show that a minimum description length model can be obtained by stochastic optimisation. Results are given for several different training sets of 2D boundaries, showing that the automatic method constructs better models than the manual landmarking approach. We also show that the method can be extended straightforwardly to 3D. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.",,"Image processing; Information science; Optimization; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Automatic method; Dense correspondences; Minimum description length; Minimum description length approach; Statistical shape model; Statistical shape modelling; Stochastic optimisation; Training example; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937409618

Lower molars of species in the chimp/human clade (including fossil hominins) possess between four and seven cusps and this variability has been implicated in alpha taxonomy and phylogenetic systematics. What is known about the developmental basis of variation in cusp number - based primarily on experimental studies of rodent molars - suggests that cusps form under a morphodynamic, patterning cascade model involving the iterative formation of enamel knots. In this study we test whether variation in cusp 6 (C6) presence in common chimpanzee and bonobo lower molars (n = 55) is consistent with predictions derived from the patterning cascade model. Using microcomputed tomography we imaged the enamel-dentine junction of lower molars and used geometric morphometrics to examine shape variation in the molar crown correlated with variation in C6 presence (in particular the size and spacing of the dentine horns). Results indicate that C6 presence is consistent with predictions of a patterning cascade model, with larger molars exhibiting a higher frequency of C6 and with the location and size of later-forming cusps correlated with C6 variation. These results demonstrate that a patterning cascade model is appropriate for interpreting cusp variation in Pan and have implications for cusp nomenclature and the use of accessory cusp morphology in primate systematics. © 2010 The Authors.

Although mouthguards provide protection, up to 25% of dentoalveolar injuries can occur with a mouthguard in place. This study examined the effect of mouthguard protection in an in vitro model. A total of 97 sheep mandibular segments with incisors at four developmental stages (early deciduous, ED, n= 37; middle deciduous, MD, n=20; late deciduous, LD, n=18; mixed dentition, PD, n=22) was used. Customised pressure formed mouthguards (MG) provided protection from trauma produced by a servohydraulic materials testing machine to test incisors. Injuries were examined clinically, radiographically and by dissection. Mean forces required to produce dentoalveolar injury were significantly greater in test (with MG) teeth than control (no MG) teeth. Mean forces to produce injury in test teeth decreased with resorbing root lengths. Deciduous incisors differed in injury type: subluxations and horizontal root fractures predominated in test teeth; lateral luxations and horizontal root fractures in control teeth. Predominant injuries in test and control permanent incisors were enamel infractions and subluxations. The magnitude of lateral luxation measurements of individual teeth was reduced significantly by mouthguard protection in both deciduous and permanent dentitions. The mouthguard tended to increase the mobility of the teeth it encompassed and, in some instances, promoted dentoalveolar injury of adjacent teeth. © Munksgaard, 1996.","Dental trauma; Luxation injuries; Mouth guards; Mouth protectors; Root fracture","analysis of variance; animal; article; comparative study; deciduous tooth; dentition; evaluation; incisor; injury; jaw; mouth protector; pathology; sheep; tooth crown; tooth fracture; tooth injury; tooth root; Alveolar Process; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Dentition, Mixed; Dentition, Primary; Evaluation Studies; Incisor; Mouth Protectors; Sheep; Tooth Avulsion; Tooth Crown; Tooth Fractures; Tooth Injuries; Tooth Root; Tooth, Deciduous",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030325785

Extant models are the principal basis for understanding dental variation in the fossil record. As the sister taxon to the hominin clade, Pan is one such model and the only widely accepted extant hominid model for both interspecific and intraspecific variation. To explore the contributions of allometric scaling and meristic variation to molar variation in Pan, we applied geometric shape analysis to 3D landmarks collected from virtual replicas of chimpanzee and bonobo mandibular molars. Multivariate statistical analysis and 3D visualization of metameric and allometric shape vectors were used to characterize shape differences and test the hypothesis that species of Pan share patterns of metameric variation and molar shape allometry. Procrustes-based shape variables were found to effectively characterize crown shape, sorting molars into species and tooth-row positions with ≥95% accuracy. Chimpanzees and bonobos share a common pattern of M 1-M 2 metameric variation, which is defined by differences in the relative position of the metaconid, size of the hypoconulid, curvature of the buccal wall, and proportions of the basins and foveae. Allometric scaling of molar shape is homogeneous for M 1 and M 2 within species, but bonobo and chimpanzee allometric vectors are significantly different. Nevertheless, the common allometric shape trend explains most molar-shape differences between P. paniscus and P. troglodytes. When allometric effects are factored out, chimpanzee and bonobo molars are not morphometrically distinguishable.

Measurements of tooth crowns included overall mesiodistal and buccolingual diameters, as well as the mesiodistal and buccolingual diameters of the trigonid and talonid. Percentage dimorphism values were greater in the talonid dimensions than the trigonid, indicating that sex differences tend to be larger in the later-developing crown units.

Studies of dental functional morphology can therefore offer important clues about the diets of fossil taxa. That said, analyses of tooth form provide insights into ability to fracture resistant foods rather than the food preferences of individuals. Recent work suggests that specialized occlusal morphology can relate to either preferred foods, or to occasionally eaten fallback items critical for survival. This paper reviews dental microwear texture analysis, a new approach that can be used to infer fracture properties of foods eaten in life. High-resolution 3D point clouds of microwear surfaces are collected and analyzed using scale-sensitive fractal analyses. Resulting data are free from operator measurement error, and allow the characterization and comparison of within-species variation in microwear texture attributes. Examples given here include four extant primate species (two folivores and two hard object fallback feeders), and two fossil hominin taxa. All groups show at least some individuals with simple microwear surfaces that suggest a lack of consumption of hard and brittle abrasive foods during the last few meals. On the other hand, some hard object fallback specimens have very complex surfaces consistent with consumption of hard, brittle foods. The latter pattern is also found in one hominin species. These results suggest that dental microwear texture analysis can help us determine whether craniodental specializations in fossil species are adaptations to preferred foods, or to less often but still critical fallback items.

Clinical image-based measures of bone mass show only moderate correlative strength with bone strength. However, engineering models derived from clinical image data predict bone strength with significantly greater accuracy. Currently, image-based finite element (FE) models are time consuming to construct and are non-parametric. The goal of this study was to develop a parametric proximal femur FE model based on a statistical shape and density model (SSDM) derived from clinical image data. A small number of independent SSDM parameters described the shape and bone density distribution of a set of cadaver femurs and captured the variability affecting proximal femur FE strength predictions. Finally, a three-dimensional FE model of an 'unknown' femur was reconstructed from the SSDM with an average spatial error of 0.016mm and an average bone density error of 0.037 g/cm 3. © 2012 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Bone strength; Finite element model; Fracture risk; Parametric model; Statistical shape model","Bone strength; Finite element models; Fracture risks; Parametric models; Statistical shape model; Bone; Fracture; Three dimensional; aged; article; audiovisual equipment; female; femur; finite element analysis; histology; human; middle aged; Aged; Female; Femur; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Middle Aged; Models, Anatomic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859341099

Morphological factors, such as the anatomical class of tooth and root lengths, and patho-anatomical factors, such as infractions, occlusal and cervical abrasions, composite and amalgam restorations and damage resulting from previous traumatic impacts, were taken into consideration. A comparison of stability after a defined impact stress showed that maxillary canines and premolars had the highest resistance to fracture; this differs significantly from the resistance of maxillary and mandibular incisors. The root length correlates directly with fracture energy and therefore to stability. Composite restorations with an adhesive joint were found to increase the resistance of a tooth to fracture, but amalgam restorations had a weakening effect. Cervical wedge-shaped defects of the tooth cause considerable destabilization, but occlusal abrasion and infractions have only a moderate weakening influence. Previous traumatic stress reduces the resistance to fracture of a tooth by up to 85%. The fracture patterns generated were very similar to clinically observed tooth fractures, indicating the results to be clinically relevant.","Abrasion; Dental trauma; Dental trauma; Fracture behavior of restored teeth; Fracture resistance; Infraction","dental alloy; analysis of variance; article; enamel; histology; human; incisor; mandible; maxilla; nonparametric test; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; premolar tooth; tooth disease; tooth fracture; tooth root; Analysis of Variance; Bicuspid; Dental Amalgam; Dental Enamel; Humans; Incisor; Mandible; Maxilla; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tooth Abrasion; Tooth Fractures; Tooth Root",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035430885

Clinically, advances in cariology and periodontology have led to better diagnostic capabilities and treatment provision. In the study of growth and development, important information regarding the varying clinical presentation and pathogenesis of many disorders is now apparent through the accurate quantification of phenotypes. Improvements in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging and analytical techniques have allowed for accurate dental phenotyping, and efforts are ongoing to apply these in vitro techniques to the in vivo setting.

The sample is represented by three specimens, SD-1219, SD-1149, and SD-370a. Descriptive morphology, linear measurements, 3D geometric morphometrics, and virtual anthropological methods were employed to address the morphological, morphometric, and phylogenetic affinities of these fossils. The fossils display Neandertal autapomorphies (e.g., bilaterally protruding transverse occipital torus, suprainiac fossa). SD-1219 also preserves a strongly projecting juxtamastoid eminence and shows occipital bunning. In linear distances, the El Sidrón occipitals are similar to each other and close to the Neandertal mean. The centroid size of SD-1219 is slightly larger than the Neandertal average. All of the evidence taken together points to the hypothesis that SD-1219 belongs to a smaller Neandertal male. Linear measurements and the vault thickness of SD-1149 also suggest a robust male individual. The gracility of SD-370a points towards an immature individual. Virtual anthropological methods were used to reconstruct a 3D model of the SD-1219 occipital for geometric morphometrics, which reveals that SD-1219 shows relatively broad and low occipital plane proportions. Within the European Pleistocene lineage sample, this fossil falls geometrically closer to primitive rather than to derived morphologies because of its increased width, and a lower, anterior position of inion relative to the biasterionic axis. These results may imply that cranial sphericity could be an important feature of intraspecific Neandertal variability. Our findings open the way for further studies of intraspecific variation in Neandertal populations, in which the El Sidrón sample may play a significant role. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The upper and lower right first molar occlusal surface 3D meshes were processed using geometric morphometric methods. A total of 265 and 274 curve and surface sliding semilandmarks were placed on the upper and lower molar surfaces, respectively. Principal component analysis and partial least square analysis were performed to assess shape parameters. Molars tended to vary between an elongated and a more square form. The first two principal components (PCs), comprising almost 1/3 of molar shape variation, were related to mesiodistal-buccolingual ratios and relative cusp position. Distal cusps displayed the greatest shape variability. Molars of males were larger than those of females (2.8 and 3.2% for upper and lower molars respectively), but no shape dimorphism was observed. Upper and lower molar sizes were significantly correlated (r2 = 0.689). Allometry was observed for both teeth. Larger lower molars were associated with shorter cusps, expansion of the distal cusp, and constriction of the mesial cusps (predicted variance 3.25%). Upper molars displayed weaker allometry (predicted variance 1.59%). Upper and lower molar shape covariation proved significant (RV = 17.26%, P &lt; 0.0001). The main parameter of molar covariation in partial least square axis 1, contributing to 30% of total covariation, was cusp height, in contrast to the primary variability traits exhibited by PC1 and PC2.

It has been previously described by Hershkovitz et al. using traditional methods. In this study, we used multiple approaches in order to characterize the outer and inner morphology of dm2-QC2, namely a descriptive investigation of the inner morphology, analysis of the dental tissues, and comparative 3D geometric morphometric investigation of various aspects of the dental crown based on data gathered from μCT images. Dm2-QC2 was compared to a sample of 44 specimens, including recent and fossil modern humans, Neanderthals, and Homo erectus.Our comprehensive quantitative investigation agrees with Hershkovitz et al. with regard to the mixed morphology of this specimen. Dm2-QC2 allies morphologically with Neanderthals and Skhul X for its squared cervical outline, but is intermediate between modern humans and Neanderthals for its mildly distally expanded crown outline. Dm2-QC2 falls within Neanderthal variability in having relatively high dentine horns with inwardly bent tips. It is peculiar for its mesio-distal elongation of the occlusal marginal ridge at the enamel-dentine junction. The relative enamel thickness delivers different results if measured at the mesial section (intermediate but closer to modern humans) or at the entire crown (close to the Neanderthal distribution). In terms of size, dm2-QC2 and Qafzeh 15 are among the largest specimens in our sample.Dm2-QC2 shows a mosaic of features, with a prevalence of those typical or at least frequent in Neanderthals. Among the latter, the mid-trigonid crest and taurodontism are only slightly expressed. On the basis of this isolated dental evidence, and considering the paucity of information available on human evolution in the Levantine Middle Pleistocene, we do not attempt a taxonomic classification of this single tooth.

Methods Our sample included 164 specimens: 57 recent H. sapiens, 44 Upper Paleolithic H. sapiens, 17 early H. sapiens, and 46 Neandertals. Of these, 59 represent dm2/M1 pairs from the same individuals. Occlusal photographs were used to obtain crown shapes of dm2s and M1s. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the matrix of shape coordinates was used to explore the pattern of morphological variation across the dm2 and M1 samples. Allometry was investigated by means of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Two-block partial least squares (2B-PLS) analysis was used to explore patterns of covariation between dm2 and M 1 crown outlines of matched individual pairs. Results The PCA confirmed significant differences between Neandertal and H. sapiens dm2 and M1 shapes. Allometry accounted for a small but statistically significant proportion of the total morphological variance. The magnitude of the allometric contribution to crown shape was stronger among Neandertals than among H. sapiens. However, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the two species share the same allometric trajectory. The 2B-PLS analysis of the pooled sample of paired individuals revealed a significant correlation in crown shape between dm2 and M1. While Procrustes distances differed significantly between dm2 and M1 in Neandertals, it did not among H. sapiens groups. Conclusions Our results confirm several of the results obtained by a similar study of upper dm2/M1 (dm2/M1), but there are differences as well. Neandertal dm2/M1 shapes are less derived than those of the dm2/M1. Such differences may support previous studies, which have suggested that different developmental and/or epigenetic factors affect the upper and lower dentitions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","allometry; geometric morphometrics; H. neanderthalensis; Homo sapiens; metameric variation; outline shape","allometry; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; deciduous tooth; dentition; development; epigenetics; Homo neanderthalensis; medical photography; molar tooth; morphology; nonhuman; null hypothesis; Paleolithic; partial least squares regression; principal component analysis; sample size; tooth crown; anatomy and histology; animal; deciduous tooth; fossil; human; molar tooth; odontometry; pathology; physical anthropology; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Fossils; Humans; Molar; Neanderthals; Odontometry; Tooth Crown; Tooth, Deciduous",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954394550

While PCG.2 appears to be certainly attributable to Homo erectus, FS-72 is somewhat more problematic, even though it is commonly listed within the Indonesian H. erectus hypodigm. Largely because of its large size, it was originally attributed to Meganthropus paleojavanicus. Subsequent study highlighted a set of metric and nonmetric crown features also found in Australopith and African early Homo (notably H. habilis) homologues. An additional problem with the taxonomic assignment of isolated teeth from the Pleistocene of Java is the presence of Pongo in these same deposits. Methods: To assess the taxonomic affinity of FS-72, we investigated its inner structure (tissue proportions and enamel-dentine junction morphology) by using techniques of 2-3D virtual imaging coupled with geometric morphometric analyses. Results: The results show that FS-72 has thinner enamel compared to fossil and recent humans and that its topographic repartition more closely follows the pongine pattern. It also exhibits a Pongo-like elongated morphology of the enamel-dentine junction, with proportionally lower and mesiodistally spaced dentine horns. Conclusions: Given the morphological and metric similarities between fossil orangutan and H. erectus molars, we tested the hypothesis that its internal morphology more closely resembles the patterns evinced by PCG.2 and modern humans than Pongo. Accordingly, we consider that FS-72 more likely represents a dm2 of Pongo rather than Homo. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","deciduous molar FS-72; Early Pleistocene; hominid paleobiodiversity; internal structure; Sangiran Dome","animal tissue; Article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; deciduous tooth; enamel; fossil hominid; Indonesia; morphometrics; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; structure analysis; taxonomic identification; anatomy and histology; animal; classification; fossil; hominid; human; molar tooth; orangutan; physical anthropology; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Dental Enamel; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Indonesia; Molar; Paleodontology; Pongo",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947044726

A newly designed molar‐attrition‐scoring standard was applied to a protohistoric skeletal sample, the Arikara (N = 143) from the North American Plains. Several criteria are used in producing a molar tooth crown wear (MTCW) score. These include: (i) the size of enamel wear facets, (ii) the amount of dentine and secondary dentine exposure, (iii) the height of the tooth, (iv) the enamel rim thickness, and (v) the amount of pulp‐cavity exposure in the advanced stages. Age‐at‐death estimates were generated from ordinary least‐squares (OLS) analysis, with estimated age regressed independently on the total molar attrition score (TMAS), mean molar‐1 tooth crown wear (ȲM1TCW), mean molar‐2 tooth crown wear (ȲM2TCW), and mean molar‐3 tooth crown wear (ȲM3TCW). In all analyses (with the exception of the third molar), the coefficient of determination (r2) revealed a strong relationship between molar attrition and age. Multiple‐regression analysis revealed a significant sex difference in molar‐attrition rates. Besides intercept and slope differences, the female scatter showed greater molar attrition variation than the male scatter. There was no statistical difference between mean upper molar attrition score (UMAS) and lower molar attrition score (LMAS). There was no significant difference in molar attrition rates by side, and side by molar tooth.

New specimens, especially from areas less well represented in the fossil record, can inform the debate on morphological changes to the skeleton and teeth and the phylogenetic course of human evolution during this period. The mandible from the cave of Mala Balanica, Serbia has recently been re-dated to at least 400 ka, and its well-preserved dentition presents an excellent opportunity to characterize molar crown morphology at this time period, and re-examine claims for a lack of Neandertal affinities in the specimen. In this study we employ microtomography to image the internal structure of the mandibular molars (focusing on the morphology of the enamel-dentine junction, or EDJ) of the BH-1 specimen and a comparative sample (n = 141) of Homo erectus sensu lato, Homo neanderthalensis, Pleistocene Homo sapiens, and recent H. sapiens. We quantitatively assess EDJ morphology using 3D geometric morphometrics and examine the expression of discrete dental traits at the dentine surface. We also compare third molar enamel thickness in BH-1 to those of H. neanderthalensis and both Pleistocene and recent H. sapiens, and document previously unreported morphology of the BH-1 premolar and molar roots. Our results highlight the reliability of the EDJ surface for classifying hominin taxa, indicate a primitive dental morphology for BH-1 molars, and confirm a general lack of derived Neandertal features for the Balanica individual. The plesiomorphic character of BH-1 is consistent with several competing models of Middle Pleistocene hominin evolution and provides an important regional and temporal example for reconstructing morphological changes in the mandible and teeth during this time period. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Enamel-dentine junction (EDJ); Hominin; Mandible; MicroCT; Middle Pleistocene; Molars","cave; dentition; human evolution; morphology; Neanderthal; phylogenetics; Pleistocene; skeleton; spatiotemporal analysis; taxonomy; Serbia; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; anatomic landmark; anatomy and histology; animal; classification; dentin; enamel; evolution; fossil; hominid; human; mandible; molar tooth; tooth root; Anatomic Landmarks; Animals; Biological Evolution; Dental Enamel; Dentin; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Mandible; Molar; Tooth Root",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959431626

However, teeth finalize their shape at an early age, whereas the face grows and is subjected to environmental influences for a prolonged period; it is therefore conceivable that covariation might modulate with age. Here we investigate the extent of this covariation in humans by measuring the 3D shape of the occlusal surface of the permanent first molars and the shape of the craniofacial complex from lateral radiographs, at two maturations stages. A sample of Greek subjects was divided into two groups (110 adult, 110 prepubertal) with equally distributed gender. The occlusal surfaces of the right first molars were 3D scanned from dental casts; 265 and 274 landmarks (including surface and curve semilandmarks) were digitized on the maxillary and mandibular molars, respectively. The corresponding lateral cephalometric radiographs were digitized with 71 landmarks. Geometric morphometric methods were used to assess shape variation and covariation. The vertical dimension of the craniofacial complex was the main parameter of shape variation, followed by anteroposterior deviations. The male craniofacial complex was larger (4.0-5.7%) and was characterized by a prominent chin and clockwise rotation of the cranial base (adult group only). Allometry was weak and statistically significant only when examined for the sample as a whole (percent variance explained: 2.1%, P = 0.0002). Covariation was statistically significant only between the lower first molar and the craniofacial complex (RV = 14.05%, P = 0.0099, and RV = 12.31%, P = 0.0162, for the prepubertal and adult groups, respectively). Subtle age-related covariation differences were noted, indicating that environmental factors may influence the pattern and strength of covariation. However, the main pattern was similar in both groups: a class III skeletal pattern (relative maxillary retrusion and mandibular protrusion), hyperdivergency, forward rotation of the posterior cranial base and upward rotation of the anterior cranial base were associated with mesiodistal elongation of the lower molars and height reduction of their distal cusps. This pattern mimics phylogeny in humans, where flexion and counterclockwise rotation of the cranial base, considered advantageous to survival, co-occur with tooth reductions that cannot be easily explained in evolutionary terms.

The cervical region of ground sections of 67 premolars that had been extracted for orthodontic reasons were analyzed using transmitted light microscopy to identify which of the following tissue interrelationships was present at the cemento-enamel junction: cementum overlapping enamel; enamel overlapping cementum; edge-to-edge relationship between cementum and enamel; or the presence of gaps between the enamel and cementum with exposed dentin. An edge-to-edge interrelation between root cementum and enamel was predominant (55.1%). In approximately one-third of the sample, gaps between cementum and enamel with exposed dentin were observed. Cementum overlapping enamel was less prevalent than previously reported, and enamel overlapping cementum was seen in a very small proportion of the sample. In any one tooth, the distribution of mineralized tissues at the cemento-enamel junction was irregular and unpredictable. The frequency of gaps between enamel and cementum with exposure of dentin was higher than previously reported, which suggests that this region is fragile and strongly predisposed to pathological changes. Hence, this region should be protected and carefully managed during routine clinical procedures such as dental bleaching, orthodontic treatment, and placement of restorative materials.",,"adolescent; article; cementum; child; dentin; enamel; female; histology; human; male; premolar tooth; tooth cervix; Adolescent; Bicuspid; Child; Dental Cementum; Dental Enamel; Dentin; Female; Humans; Male; Tooth Cervix",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949751075

A previous study utilizing dental morphology concluded that the groups of mostly young adult females interred in four mass graves in Mound 72 were likely not from Cahokia and possibly reflect sacrificial offerings from outside communities. The purpose of this study is to reevaluate these findings using multiple indicators of biological relatedness and place of origin/migration. Materials and Methods: Biological relatedness in Mound 72 was examined using dental metrics and morphology. Four additional archaeological samples from nearby sites were included to better assess biological variation within Mound 72. Strontium isotope analysis (87Sr/86Sr) was also conducted on individuals from several burial features in Mound 72 to determine heterogeneity in place of origin. Results: Biodistance studies indicate that individuals in the four mass graves are phenotypically similar to other groups in the region, whereas F229-lower, a burial group with an aberrant mortuary context, is phenotypically distinct. Strontium isotope analyses show that mean Sr signatures for each feature investigated fall within the established local range for Cahokia. However, the range of Sr ratios for individuals in F229-lower is very narrow, suggesting they reflect a single population from a limited geologic region. Discussion: Collectively, these results question the long-standing idea that individuals in the four mass graves were non-local to Cahokia and suggest that F229-lower contained a biologically dissimilar group that either came from an outside region with a similar Sr signature to Cahokia, or represent a distinct and restricted group from the region. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biological variation; dental anthropology; migration; Mississippian; strontium isotope analysis","strontium; strontium 86; strontium 87; unclassified drug; adolescence; archeology; Article; bone structure; female; geographic and geological phenomena; human; isotope analysis; male; mound; phenotype; population migration; population research; posthumous care; sex difference; tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941354008

The area of attrition on each tooth demonstrated a significant positive correlation with age, but a wide individual variation was observed in the values for each tooth. Therefore, this method was unsuitable for accurate age estimation of a single tooth. A strong negative correlation with age was observed in the number of sites of attrition. A multiple stepwise regression analysis using the variables 'attrition area' and 'attrition number' revealed multiple correlation coefficient values of 0.93.

The proposed approach uses statistical shape and intensity models (SSIMs) to represent the variability across a wide range of patients, in terms of femoral shape and bone density. The approach feasibility is demonstrated by using a training dataset of computer tomography scans from British subjects aged 25-106 years (75 male and 34 female). For each gender, a thousand new virtual femur geometries were generated using a subset of principal components required to capture 95% of the variance in both female and male training datasets. Significant differences were found in basic anatomic parameters between females and males: anteversion, CCD angle, femur and neck lengths, head offsets and radius, cortical thickness, densities in both Gruen and neck zones. The measured anteversion for female subjects was found to be twice as high as that for male subjects: 13 ± 6.4. ° vs. 6.3 ± 7.8. ° using the training datasets compared to 12.96 ± 6.68 vs. 5.83 ± 9.2 using the thousand virtual femurs. No significant differences were found in canal flare indexes.

Available methods for quantifying molar occlusal shape have historically been confined to qualitative descriptions. The present study utilized geometric morphometric analyses to capture molar shape as defined through relative cusp locations. Cusp apices of maxillary and mandibular first and second molars were digitized from 190 American Blacks and Whites to estimate biological affinity through the shape of relative cusp locations. The coordinate data were subjected to a Generalized Procrustes Analysis to generate Procrustes coordinates and calculate centroid sizes. Procrustes coordinates were then subjected to a principal component analysis to examine the direction and magnitude of shape change inherent in the sample. Centroid size and major shape component group means were compared with t-tests. Interlandmark distances were then calculated from the raw coordinate information and also subjected to a principal components analysis. Procrustes coordinates and the principal components derived from them with and without centroid size, along with the interlandmark distances and the principal components derived from them, were each subjected to a discriminant function analysis to examine which methods yielded the highest correct classification between population groups. Total correct classifications ranged from 62.7% to 87.9% depending on the variables forward stepwise selected for each analysis.

In this study, dental crown shape of the three early Pleistocene hominin teeth (P3, M1, and M1) found in Jianshi, Hubei Province of China was analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. The comparative samples of fossil hominins from Africa, Asia, and Europe as well as those of modern humans (N = 257) were used. The results indicate that the contour, asymmetry, and cusp patterns of these three types of teeth differ obviously between the fossil hominins and modern humans. The crown shape of P3 in most fossil hominins including Australopithecus, African early Homo, and Asian Pleistocene hominins are asymmetric with their crown occlusal contours long and curving elliptic-shaped. The occlusal contour of the fossil hominin M1 is symmetric and rectangle-shaped with no marked cusp protrusion. The crown shape of fossil M1 is characterized by asymmetric contour with slightly projected metaconid and hypoconid. On the contrary, in modern Chinese and some European late Pleistocene hominins, the crowns of P3s show symmetric contours with buccal side wider than lingual side; the crown shape of M1 is asymmetric with lingual cusp distalplaced, especially for hypoconid; the M1 has symmetric and round crown contour. Our study reveals that Australopithecus has wide variations in its crown shape, whereas these dental morphospaces of Asian hominins are closely placed. The crown contour, symmetry, and cusp patterns of these three teeth of Jianshi hominin resemble those of Asian early and middle Pleistocene hominins. No marked difference in dental crown shape is shown between the Jianshi hominin and other Chinese Homo erectus, and there is also no evidence in support of the Jianshi hominin's closeness to Australopithecus and African early Homo members. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","China; geometric morphometric; Hubei; human evolution; Jianshi; shape; tooth","Crown shape; Dental crowns; East Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Hominins; Homo erectus; Hubei Province; Human evolution; Late Pleistocene; Morphometric analysis; Pleistocene; Geometry; Dentistry; asymmetry; fossil record; geometry; hominid; human evolution; morphology; morphometry; Pleistocene; shape; symmetry; taxonomy; tooth; China; Hubei; Jianshi; Australopithecus; Homo erectus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955306088

Various theories have been proposed to explain how this variation is brought about in the molars. Actualistic data that support the theories, however, are still relatively scarce because of methodological limitations. Here we propose new methods to analyse detailed tooth crown morphologies. We applied morphometric mapping to the enamel–dentine junction of human maxillary molars and examined whether odontogenetic models were adaptable to human maxillary molars. Our results showed that the upper first molar is phenotypically distinct among the maxillary molars. The average shape of the upper first molar is characterized by four well-defined cusps and precipitous surface relief of the occlusal table. On the other hand, upper third molar is characterized by smooth surface relief of the occlusal table and shows greater shape variation and distinct distribution patterns in morphospace. The upper second molar represents an intermediate state between first and third molar. Size-related shape variation was investigated by the allometric vector analysis, and it appeared that human maxillary molars tend to converge toward the shape of the upper first molar as the size increases. Differences between the upper first molar and the upper second and third molar can thus be largely explained as an effect of allometry. Collectively, these results indicate that the observed pattern of metameric variation in human molars is consistent with odontogenetic models of molar row structure (inhibitory cascade model) and molar crown morphology (patterning cascade model).

Several techniques have been used to analyze tooth form in hypodontia patients and these have shown smaller tooth dimensions and anomalous tooth shapes in patients with hypodontia when compared with controls. However, previous studies have mainly used 2D images and provided limited information. In the present study, 3D surface-imaging and statistical shape analysis were used to evaluate tooth form differences between hypodontia and control patients. Eighteen anatomical landmarks were recorded on the clinical crown of the lower left first permanent molar of 3D scanned study models of hypodontia and control subjects. The study sample group comprised of 120 hypodontia patients (40 mild, 40 moderate, and 40 severe hypodontia patients) and 40 age- and sex-matched controls. Procrustes coordinates were utilized to scale and superimpose the landmark coordinate data and then were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, differences in shape as well as size were tested statistically using allometric analysis and MANOVA. Significant interaction was found between the two factor variables ""group"" and ""sex"" (p < 0.002). Overall expected accuracies were 66 and 56% for females and males, respectively, in the cross-validated discriminant-analysis using the first 20 PCs. Hypodontia groups showed significant shape differences compared with the control subjects (p < 0.0001). Significant differences in tooth crown shape were also found between sexes (p < 0.0001) within groups. Furthermore, the degree of variation in tooth form was proportional to the degree of the severity of the hypodontia. Thus, quantitative measurement of tooth shape in hypodontia patients may enhance the multidisciplinary management of those patients. © 2014 Al-Shahrani, Dirks, Jepson and Khalaf.","Hypodontia; Procrustes analysis; Shape analysis; Teeth","adult; age distribution; allometry; article; case control study; clinical assessment tool; controlled study; cross-sectional study; discriminant analysis; disease severity; female; human; hypodontia; image analysis; image processing; major clinical study; male; measurement accuracy; molar tooth; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; sex difference; statistical analysis; three dimensional geometric morphometrics; three dimensional imaging; tooth crown; tooth size",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901014667

Images are represented as sets of four-dimensional (4D) sites combining position and intensity information, as well as their associated uncertainty and joint variation. This model seamlessly allows for the representation of both images and statistical models (such as those used for classification of normal/abnormal anatomy and for inter-patient registration), as well as other representations such as landmarks or meshes. A GIM-based registration method aimed at the construction and application of statistical models of images is proposed. A procedure based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is modified to deal with features other than position and to integrate statistical information. Furthermore, we modify the ICP framework by using a Kalman filter to efficiently compute the transformation. The initialization and update of the statistical model are also described. Preliminary results show the feasibility of the approach and its potentialities. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this work was to use statistical shape modeling (SSM) to synthesize a skeleton model of the large bronchi of the pediatric airway tree and to test for overall airway shape differences between two populations. Airway tree anatomy was segmented from volumetric chest computed tomography of 20 control subjects and 20 subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF). Airway centerlines, particularly bifurcation points, provide landmarks for SSM. Multivariate linear and logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between airway shape variation, subject size, and disease state. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to test the ability to detect shape differences between control and CF groups. Simulation experiments, using tree shapes with known size and shape variations, were performed as a technical validation. Models were successfully created using SSM methods. Simulations demonstrated that the analysis process can detect shape differences between groups. In clinical data, CF status was discriminated with good accuracy (precision = 0.7, recall = 0.7) in leave-one-out cross-validation. Logistic regression modeling using all subjects showed a good fit (ROC AUC = 0.85) and revealed significant differences in SSM parameters between control and CF groups. The largest mode of shape variation was highly correlated with subject size (R = 0.95, p < 0.001). SSM methodology can be applied to identify shape differences in the airway between two populations. This method suggests that subtle shape differences exist between the CF airway and disease control. © 2015, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.","Comparative anatomy; Computed tomography; Cystic fibrosis; Lung","Computerized tomography; Disease control; Pediatrics; Regression analysis; Bifurcation points; Comparative anatomy; Cystic fibrosis; Leave-one-out cross validations; Logistic Regression modeling; Logistic regressions; Lung; Statistical shape model; Population statistics; adolescent; anatomic landmark; anatomical variation; Article; bronchus; child; clinical article; clinical study; comparative anatomy; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cystic fibrosis; female; human; male; measurement accuracy; morphology; pilot study; priority journal; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; simulation; statistical model; statistical shape modeling; tracheobronchial tree; algorithm; anatomy and histology; case control study; computer simulation; demography; infant; preschool child; principal component analysis; receiver operating characteristic; statistical model; young adult; Adolescent; Algorithms; Bronchi; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Computer Simulation; Demography; Female; Humans; Infant; Logistic Models; Male; Models, Statistical; Principal Component Analysis; ROC Curve; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952660211
