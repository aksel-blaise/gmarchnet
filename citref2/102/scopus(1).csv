A new method is presented that generalizes Siegel and Benson's (1982) resistant-fit theta-rho analysis so that more than two objects can be compared at the same time. Both least-squares and resistant-fit approaches are generalized to allow for affine transformations (uniform shape change). The methods are compared, using artificial data and data on 18 landmarks on the wings of 127 species of North American mosquitoes.

The objective of this report is to provide a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of the Pleistocene when sea levels were below present day levels. Location: The maps presented here cover tropical Southeast Asia and Austral-Asia. The east-west coverage extends 8000 km from Australia to Sri Lanka. The north-south coverage extends 5000 km from Taiwan to Australia. Methods: Present-day bathymetric depth contours were used to estimate past shore lines and the locations of the major drowned river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves. The timing of sea level changes associated with glaciation over the past 250,000 years was taken from multiple sources that, in some cases, account for tectonic uplift and subsidence during the period in question. Results: This report provides a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of 17,000, 150,000 and 250,000 years before present. The ancient shorelines are based on present day depth contours of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 120 m. On the maps depicting shorelines at 75, 100 and 120 m below present levels the major Pleistocene river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves are depicted. Estimates of the number of major sea level fluctuation events and the duration of time that sea levels were at or below the illustrated level are provided. Main conclusions: Previous reconstructions of sea-level change during the Pleistocene have emphasized the maximum lows. The perspective provided here emphasizes that sea levels were at their maximum lows for relatively short periods of time but were at or below intermediate levels (e.g. at or below 40 m below present-day levels) for more than half of each of the time periods considered.","Biogeography; Maps; Palaeogeography; Pleistocene; Sea levels; Southeast Asia","deglaciation; glaciation; Pleistocene; river system; sea level change; shoreline change; timescale; Asia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034492377

Mungo III, the source of the world's oldest human mitochondrial DNA, has been variously estimated at 30 thousand years (kyr) old, 42-45 kyr old and 62 ± 6 kyr old, while radiocarbon estimates placed the Mungo I cremation near 20-26 kyr ago.

This was followed by sustained aridity between 40 and 30 kyr ago.

In the eastern equatorial Pacific, coral isotopic records track variations in ENSO-related changes in sea-surface temperature; further west, corals record variability in sea-surface temperature and rainfall that accompanies zonal displacement of the Indonesian Low during ENSO events. These multi-century records reveal previously unrecognised ENSO variability on time scales of decades to centuries. Outside the ENSO-sensitive equatorial Pacific, long-term trends towards recent warmer/wetter conditions suggest the tropics respond to global forcings. New coral paleothermometers indicate that surface-ocean temperatures in the tropical southwestern Pacific were depressed by 4-6°C during the Younger Dryas climatic event and rose episodically during the next 4000 yr. High temporal-resolution measurements of Sr/Ca and δ18O in corals provide information about the surface-ocean hydrologic balance and can resolve the seasonal balance between precipitation and evaporation. Radiocarbon measurements in corals, coupled with ocean circulation models, may be used to reconstruct near-surface ocean circulation, past mixing rates, and the distribution of fossil fuel CO2 in the upper ocean. Most recently, seasonal to interannual variations in the radiocarbon of corals from the equatorial Pacific have been linked to the redistribution of surface waters associated with the ENSO.",,"coral record; paleoclimate; tropical environment; Pacific Ocean",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033985826

Most analysts favor either a 40,000 BP or 60,000 BP arrival time, though some have proposed a much earlier date. Here we review data from more than 30 archaeological sites with basal ages >20,000 years reported since 1993, giving special attention to five sites with purported ages >45,000 years. We conclude that while the continent was probably occupied by 42-45,000 BP, earlier arrival dates are not well-supported. This observation undercuts claims for modern human migrations out of Africa and beyond the Levant before 50,000 BP.

The isotopic Th/U and Pa/U ratios indicate that some minor uranium mobilization may have occurred in the past. Taking such effects into account, the best age estimate for the human skeleton is obtained through the combination of U-series and ESR analyses yielding 62,000 ± 6000 years. This age is in close agreement with OSL age estimates on the sediment into which the skeleton was buried of 61,000 ± 2000 years. Furthermore, we obtained a U-series age of 81,000 ± 21,000 years for the calcitic matrix that was precipitated on the bones after burial. All age results are considerably older than the previously assumed age of LM3 and demonstrate the necessity for directly dating hominid remains. We conclude that the Lake Mungo 3 burial documents the earliest known human presence on the Australian continent. The age implies that people who were skeletally within the range of the present Australian indigenous population colonized the continent during or before oxygen isotope stage 4 (57,000-71,000 years).","ESR; Lake Mungo 3; OSL dating; U-series","electron spin resonance dating; uranium series dating; Australia; Lake Mungo; New South Wales; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033150554

Thermoluminescence dates of 50-60 ka, reported for initial occupation of the Malakunanja II site in northern Australia, have been used as a means of calibrating the rate of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evolution in modern humans. Optical dating of unburnt quartzose sediments from a rock shelter site (Nauwalabila I, Lindner Site) in Deaf Adder Gorge, 70 km south of Malakunanja II, provides new evidence for the timing of the colonisation of the continent. Optical dates were determined for several stratigraphic levels within a 3 m deep excavation, in which flaked stone artefacts and ground pigments were found in primary depositional setting. The lowest human occupation levels are bracketed by dates of 53.4 ± 5.4 ka and 60.3 ± 6.7 ka, while the upper levels show good agreement between optical and calibrated 14C age estimates. High-quality haematite with ground facets and striations is associated directly with the 53 ka level and indicates the use of pigments by these early Australians. The optical dates independently confirm evidence for the colonisation of northern Australia shortly after 60 ka and should be seen in the context of this region as having been a likely entry route for the first human movements into Sahul. © 1994.",,"archaeological evidence; historical studies; human colonisation; human colonization; optical date; Sahul; thermoluminescence dating; TL date; Australia, Northern Territory, Deaf Adder Gorge",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028597670

These are the total replacement (""Eve') and the continuity (multiregional evolution) models, both of which have clearly definable, completely different predictions about the pattern of past evolution, as well as different expectations about the distribution of certain grade (modernizing) and clade (regional, such as African, North Asian, etc.) features in the human fossil record. Using the prehistoric skeletal data of Australasia, North Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Levant, the conflicting predictions of these two models are tested by evaluating evidence for the existence of transitional samples and the persistence of morphological and metric features over time and space. The differences between the ""Eve' and the multiregional evolution models are so profound it is impossible for both to be correct. These differences in theoretical expectations relate to the requirements of the Eve theory that a single source of all contemporary mtDNA variation exists and that this source is derived exclusively from a relatively recent African female (Eve). This article shows that while an extreme replacement interpretation is unsupportable, the mtDNA data can be reconciled with the fossil record within the context of multiregional evolution. -from Authors",,"archaeological evidence; Eve model; evolution; evolution model; fossil record; historical studies; hominid; human origin; multiregional model; palaeontological test; skeletal data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027387147

These patterns permitted us to speculate on past atmospheric circulation in the South Pacific and the underlying forcing missing line mechanisms. During full glacial times, with vastly extended Australasian land area and circum-Antarctic ice-shelves, arid and cold conditions characterized all circum-South Pacific land areas, except for a narrow band in southern South America (43° to 45°S) that might have been even wetter and moister than today. This implies that ridging at subtropical and mid-latitudes must have been greatly increased and that the storm tracks were located farther south than today. At 12000 BP when precipitation had increased in southern Australia, New Zealand, and the mid-latitudes of South America, ridging was probably still as strong as before but had shifted into the eastern Pacific, leading to weaker westerlies in the western Pacific and more southerly located westerlies in the eastern Pacific. At 9000 BP when, except for northernmost Australia, precipitation reached near modern levels, the south Pacific ridges and the westerlies must have weakened. Because of the continuing land connection between New Guinea and Australia, and reduced seasonality, the monsoon pattern had still not developed. By 6000 BP, moisture levels in Australia and New Zealand reached their maximum, indicating that the monsoon pattern had become established. Ridging in the South Pacific was probably weaker than today, and the seasonal shift of the westerlies was stronger than before.

There is compelling archaeological evidence that people in various parts of the world often had a depleting effect on shellfish populations. Shellfish and other marine resources have sometimes been perceived as lowly ranked foods and coastal archaeological sites have often been interpreted as temporary (possibly seasonal) sites for the exploitation of these 'inferior' food resources. This model has been challenged by studies of mid-Holocene Mesolithic hunter-gatherer sites in Atlantic Europe, which have shown that marine foods were the main component of the total diet and that human foraging can deplete shellfish resources. Although subsistence systems based on coastal resources might have been both viable and acceptable in dietary terms, regular mobility would have been necessary for them to be sustainable. On longer time scales, such coastal mobility might result in population dispersal. Sites associated with early anatomically modern humans show the antiquity of coastal adaptations, including the consumption of shellfish, and the dispersal of early modern humans out of Africa into south-east Asia and 'Greater Australia' could have been through coastal environments. This coastal dispersal could have been driven, at least in part, by the impact of early human foragers on intertidal food resources. Resource depletion in coastal zones was probably among the first significant, but small-scale, 'ecological impacts' of human beings.","Coastal resources; Colonization; Early modern humans; Hunter-gatherer mobility; Over-exploitation; Resource depletion; Shell middens; Shellfish","human settlement; hunter-gatherer; mollusc; prehistoric; resource depletion; shellfish",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036187303

(A.D. 1270-1475). This was associated with a ∼1.5°C fall in temperature (determined from oxygen-isotope analysis) and an observed increase in El Niño frequency. For a long time, it has been clear that these changes - characterized as the ""A.D. 1300 event"" - brought about environmental and cultural changes on Pacific Islands. These are documented here systematically for the first time. Temperature fall, sea-level fall, and possibly short-lived precipitation increase are the principal effects of the A.D. 1300 event. Temperature fall stressed ecosystems, but its effects are difficult to separate from those of the others. Sea-level fall saw dramatic falls of nearshore coral-reef productivity and the formation of (habitable) reef islands (motu). Precipitation rise increased upland erosion and lowland sedimentation. The human outcomes of these environmental changes are organized in three groups: conflict, settlement-pattern changes, and the end of long-distance voyaging. Conflict increased during/after the A.D. 1300 event because of an abrupt fall in the food resource base. This also caused large coastal settlements on many islands to be abandoned in favor of caves and/or smaller fortified hilltop settlements. Successful long-distance voyages ceased during/after the A.D. 1300 event, as did interisland exchange within many archipelagoes. The regional (rather than local) extent of the A.D. 1300 event is demonstrated.

Therefore, information on phenotypic traits is an important component of comparative studies of development. Morphometrics permits the rigorous quantitative analysis of variation in organismal size and shape, and is increasingly being used in developmental contexts. The new methods of morphometrics combine a geometric concept of shape with the procedures of multivariate statistics, and constitute a powerful and flexible set of tools for analyzing morphological variation. This paper briefly reviews these methods and provides examples of their application in studies of genetic variation and developmental modularity. The results of morphometric analyses can be readily interpreted in relation to the geometry and anatomical structure of the parts under study. Genetic studies of shape in the mouse mandible found two recurrent patterns in environmental and genetic variation from different origins, suggesting that the development system 'channels' the phenotypic expression of variation in similar ways. Moreover, by analyzing the correlations of left-right asymmetries of morphometric traits, it is possible to delimit the spatial extent of developmental modules. These methods complement the experimental approaches of developmental biology and genetics, and can be expected to be especially fruitful in combination with them. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In order to account for these structures, biomechanical interpretations in terms of masticatory stress and the effects of structural constraints have been put forward. This paper examines the multivariate relationships between robusticity and cranial dimensions in modern humans through canonical correlation and principal components analyses. These analyses reveal a very significant association between robusticity and cranial size, by which the larger the size of the skull, the greater the development of the cranial superstructures. In this context, size is biased towards maximum cranial length, various measures of upper facial breadth, basion-nasion length and palato-dental size. A statistically less important relationship between robusticity and cranial shape reveals that there are two main circumstances in which a modern skull will develop superstructures, in either very large crania, independent of the breadth of the vault, or in very narrow ones with large teeth. The cranial superstructures are not only strongly influenced by certain cranial dimensions, but are inter-correlated in their expression. These morphological features should not be treated as independent phylogenetic traits. The majority of recent crania are relatively small and gracile, clearly the result of a common temporal trend in the evolution of modern human cranial diversity. Although not unique in their level of robusticity among recent human groups, Australian aboriginals are the only population to show a relationship between robusticity and cranial breadth. It is suggested that the total morphological pattern observed in Australia does not reflect a plesio-morphic condition, but the specific history of occupation of that continent favouring size reduction with the maintenance of robusticity. Finally, it is shown that most early modern fossils are comparatively large and robust. It is suggested that the definition of a modern cranial form should be disassociated from the concept of gracility, only observed in some recent human populations. © 1996 Academic Press Limited.","Canonical correlation analysis; Cranial robusticity; Modern humans; Multivariate analysis; Principal components analysis; Regional patterns","Crania; Homo sapiens; cranial shape; cranial size; cranium; Homo sapiens; robusticity; statistical analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030449383

But the spatial signature of the event in the southern mid-latitudes and tropics is less well known, as records are sparse and inconclusive. Here we present high-resolution analyses of skeletal Sr/Ca and 18O/16O ratios for a giant fossil Diploastrea heliopora coral that was preserved in growth position on the raised reef terraces of Espiritu Santo Island, Vanuatu, in the southwestern tropical Pacific Ocean. Our data indicate that sea surface temperatures in Vanuatu were on average 4.5 ± 1.3 °C cooler during the Younger Dryas event than today, with a significant interdecadal modulation. The amplified annual cycle of sea surface temperatures, relative to today, indicates that cooling was caused by the compression of tropical waters towards the Equator.

Either fully modern humans were present well outside Africa at a surprisingly early date or the behavioral capabilities long thought to be uniquely theirs were also associated, at least to some degree, with other hominids. Deciding whether these dates are accurate and associated with definite evidence of human activity thus becomes critically important. We think there are good reasons to be skeptical, not only on the basis of the dates and their alleged associations, but because of their mismatch with established sequences, both in Greater Australia and elsewhere. Until these issues are resolved, adjusting the broader global picture to accommodate these early dates is premature.","Australia; Colonization; Luminescence dating techniques; Pleistocene archaeology; Radiocarbon chronology; Spread of modern humans","Hominidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032326006

As yet, such records have not been identified beyond 5500 years of age. Recent palaeotempestological studies in the United States and northern Australia have highlighted that the frequency and magnitude of these natural hazards do not remain constant over time, and there are periods when cyclogenesis is enhanced, and others of relative quiescence. Recognition of such regime changes, or non-stationarity in the long-term record, is important for risk assessments of this hazard.

Evaluating its ancestry is important to our understanding of modern human origins in Australasia because the prevailing models of human origins make different predictions for the ancestry of this specimen, and others like it. Some authors believe in the validity of a complete replacement theory and propose that modern humans in Australasia descended solely from earlier modern human populations found in Late Pleistocene Africa and the Levant. These ancestral modern populations are believed to have completely replaced other archaic human populations, including the Ngandong hominids of Indonesia. According to this recent African origin theory, the archaic humans from Indonesia are classified as Homo erectus, a different evolutionary species that could not have contributed to the ancestry of modern Australasians. Therefore this theory of complete replacement makes clear predictions concerning the ancestry of the specimen WLH-50. We tested these predictions using two methods: a discriminant analysis of metric data for three samples that are potential ancestors of WLH-50 (Ngandong, Late Pleistocene Africans, Levant hominids from Skhul and Qafzeh) and a pairwise difference analysis of nonmetric data for individuals within these samples. The results of these procedures provide an unambiguous refutation of a model of complete replacement within this region, and indicate that the Ngandong hominids or a population like them may have contributed significantly to the ancestry of WLH-50. We therefore contend that Ngandong hominids should be classified within the evolutionary species, Homo sapiens. The Multiregional model of human evolution has the expectation that Australasian ancestry is in all three of the potentially ancestral groups and best explains modern Australasian origins.","Australasia; Modern human origins; Multiregional evolution; Ngandong; Recent African origins; WLH-50","evolution; Australia; Hominidae; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033928604

However, artificial vault deformation has been suggested to be the cause of 'archaic' characters such as frontal recession in key fossil Australian crania. We use log-log plots of cranial arc versus chord measurements and we score nonmetric traits often thought to be associated with artificial deformation to make systematic comparisons across groups and deformation types to identify universal consequences of artificial deformation. Based on our large comparative sample (n=588) apparatus-deformed crania have flatter frontals and occipitals and usually more angulated parietals in the sagittal plane than undeformed crania, regardless of deformation type. Fossil Australian samples exhibit evidence of both undeformed and deformed individuals. The sample from Coobool Creek provides evidence that undeformed individuals had more rounded frontals than recent Australians. However, many individuals from Coobool Creek, Kow Swamp, and Nacurrie exhibit modification of one or more cranial contours. The Kow Swamp individuals in particular plot with deformed crania from all regions. In addition, the frequency of hyperostotic traits such as bregmatic eminence, metopic and sagittal keels in H. sapiens is influenced by both artificial deformation and pathological hypervascularity/hyperostosis. Thus it is unwise to use cranial contours and these nonmetric traits to infer genetic relatedness between Fossil Australians and Indonesian H. erectus.","Cranial contours; Homo erectus; Origin of H. sapiens","cranium; evolution; Australia; Indonesia; Animalia; Crania; Hominidae; Homo erectus; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033081055

Lac Saint Louis is a freshwater swamp at 3 m a.s.l. adjacent to the River Coulee delta. Pollen analysis, charcoal analysis, radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic analyses have been used to reconstruct the vegetation and sedimentary history of the swamp. The sediment record commences at 6000 BP and reflects rapid floodplain development associated with postglacial sea-level rise. This rapid accumulation of sediment ceased around 5500 BP and the site became a freshwater swamp. From 5500 to 3000 BP the pollen record reflects several aspects of this coastal landscape; coastal forest, the swamp surface and the adjacent mangrove zone. At 3000 BP charcoal levels increase significantly in conjunction with abrupt changes in the pollen record. Mangrove pollen declines and pollen indicative of coastal forest is replaced by pollen indicative of coastal savanna. These changes coincide with the commencement of the archaeological record in New Caledonia and mirror similar changes in other late-Holocene records elsewhere on the island, and are interpreted as representing human impact. Yam terraces surrounding Lac Saint Louis may have been built around 2000 BP based on mineral magnetic measurements and charcoal accumulation.

An LGM age for the Kow Swamp people is supported by palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. The shoreline silt, in which most of them were interred, was deposited by high lake levels between 26 and 19 ka. Few robust people were left after 19 ka when a sand lunette formed.

The unusual development of the vault structures in this individual has few, if any, equals among other hominids or more recent populations from around the world. The vault morphology is, therefore, described in terms of a pathologically related condition associated with the modern haemolytic blood dyscrasias, typical of sickle cell anamia and thalassemia. A possible palaeoepidemiology for these genetic adaptations among early Australasian populations is proposed together with a discussion of similar changes observed in the vault of the Singa calvarium from the Sudan. It is tentatively suggested that the cranial thickening of the Australian hominid has its origins in some form of genetic blood disease and that if this diagnosis is correct, this individual provides a rare glimpse of human biological adaptation in the late Upper Pleistocene.

Most details about Pleistocene history come from studies of ocean-floor sediments, although a few insular pollen records extend back into the last glacial stage. There is limited evidence for Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) aridity and a rise in LGM-early Holocene precipitation associated with strengthening of the Southern Oscillation. The middle Holocene warming is best represented by sea-level records, which, from all parts of the Pacific, now show a contemporary maximum ca. 5000-3000 yr BP. Late Holocene cooling and precipitation increase were probably more widespread than available data suggest. The advent of humans into Pacific island environments, mostly during the late Holocene, is critically reviewed. Vegetation change may have, at least in part, been the result of climate change. Many Pacific island grasslands may be climatogenic rather than anthropogenic. Fires may have occurred naturally long before people arrived on Pacific islands.

This claim was later refuted by others, who suggested that artificial cranial deformation may have been responsible for at least some of the distinctive and “primitive” traits seen in the Kow Swamp individuals. Previous research by this worker and others has indicated that taxonomic traits at both specific and subspecific levels are present in hominine femora. Therefore, it may be possible to evaluate the “primitiveness” of the Kow Swamp sample on the basis of their femoral anatomy. Morphometric analyses were undertaken, using as controls femora of Romano British, Tasmanian, and other Murray Valley populations. On the basis of bivariate and multivariate analyses it was found that, at least in this single element of the postcranium, no primitive features were present. The Kow Swamp sample, in fact, shows a very close morphometric relationship with all included Homo sapiens controls and is significantly distinct from Homo erectus.
