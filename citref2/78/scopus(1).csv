Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

To clarify how and when these differences arise in ontogeny, we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Honto sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96 traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor the differences among the African apes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The accuracy of linear measurements of enamel thickness and cortical bone thickness taken from CT scans is evaluated by making comparison with measurements taken directly from physical sections. The measurements of cortical bone are taken on extant and fossil specimens with and without attached matrix, and the dental specimens studied include a sample of 12 extant human molars. Local CT numbers (representing X‐ray, attenuation) are used to determine the exact position of the boundaries of a structure. Using this technique most studied dimensions, including four of human molar enamel thickness, could be obtained from CT scans with a maximum error range of ±0.1 mm.

The tests require novel statistical and geometrical analyses of the Procrustes shape manifold.

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A historically influential interpretation of this morphology hypothesizes that loads applied to the premolars during feeding had a profound influence on the evolution of australopith craniofacial form. Here, we test this hypothesis using finite element analysis in conjunction with comparative, imaging, and experimental methods. We find that the facial skeleton of the Australopithecus type species, A. africanus, is well suited to withstand premolar loads. However, we suggest that the mastication of either small objects or large volumes of food is unlikely to fully explain the evolution of facial form in this species. Rather, key aspects of australopith craniofacial morphology are more likely to be related to the ingestion and initial preparation of large, mechanically protected food objects like large nuts and seeds. These foods may have broadened the diet of these hominins, possibly by being critical resources that australopiths relied on during periods when their preferred dietary items were in short supply.

It has, therefore, been suggested that modern humans and Neanderthals reached large brain sizes along different evolutionary pathways [2]. Here, we assess when during development these adult differences emerge. This is critical for understanding whether differences in the pattern of brain development might underlie potential cognitive differences between these two closely related groups. Previous comparisons of Neanderthal and modern human cranial development have shown that many morphological characteristics separating these two groups are already established at the time of birth [3-5], and that the subsequent developmental patterns of the face are similar, though not identical [6].

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549154351

Numerous advances in microsurgical technique, plating technology and instrumentation, and an understanding of donor site angiosomes have made consistent and reliable mandibular reconstruction possible. Refinements in technique continue to improve the functional and aesthetic outcomes of oromandibular reconstruction. This review discusses the current state-of-the-art techniques for mandibular reconstruction and highlights the latest innovations in technique. Recent findings: The most common indication for oromandibular reconstruction remains ablative surgery for advanced neoplastic processes of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Reconstruction of these complex three-dimensional composite bony and soft-tissue defects is paramount for rehabilitation of form and function. Vascularized osseous free tissue transfer is the state-of-the-art for mandibular reconstruction. The long-term excellent functional and aesthetic outcomes of this technique have recently been reported. The most commonly used free flaps for mandibular reconstruction are the fibula, iliac crest, and scapula. Each of these typically accepts endosseous implants improving functional outcomes. The use of mandibular reconstruction plates and coverage with a soft-tissue flap remains a reconstructive option for selected patients. The latest refinements in technique include temporary intraoperative external fixation, the use of periosteal free flaps, distraction osteogenesis, and development of biodegradable biopolymer scaffolds for mandibular defects. Summary: Oromandibular reconstruction, although a challenge for the head and neck reconstructive surgeon, is now reliable and highly successful with excellent long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes.","Free tissue transfer; Mandibular reconstruction; Reconstruction plates; Vascularized bone graft","steel; titanium; bone graft; bone plate; bone screw; cancer surgery; distraction osteogenesis; fibula; follow up; free tissue graft; head and neck surgery; human; iliac crest; implant; joint prosthesis; mandible reconstruction; mouth cancer; oropharynx cancer; periosteum; priority journal; radius; review; scapula; soft tissue; surgical technique; temporomandibular joint; tooth implantation; treatment outcome; Bone Transplantation; Humans; Mandible; Osteogenesis, Distraction; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Surgical Flaps; Tissue Survival; Treatment Outcome",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3242809745

Because of the precarious state of preservation of the original material, we applied entirely noninvasive methods of fossil reconstruction and morphometry, using a combination of computed tomography, computer graphics, and stereolithography. After electronic restoration, the isolated original pieces were recomposed on the computer screen using external and internal anatomical clues to position the bone fragments and mirror images to complete missing parts. The inferred effects of general compressive deformation that occurred during fossilization were corrected by virtual decompression of the skull. The resulting new reconstruction of the Le Moustier 1 skull shows morphologic features close to the typical Neanderthal adult state. Residual asymmetry of skeletal parts can be traced to in vivo skeletal modification: the left mandibular joint shows signs of a healed condylar fracture, and the anatomy of the occipital region suggests mild plagiocephaly. Using micro-CT analysis, the left incus could be recovered from the matrix filling of the middle ear cavity. Its morphometric dimensions are similar to those of the La Ferrassie III incus. The morphometric characteristics of the inner ear deviate substantially from the condition reported as typical for Neanderthals and fall within the range of modern human variability.","Computed tomography; Incus; Inner ear; Le Moustler; Morphometry; Neanderthal; Stereolithography; Virtual fossil reconstruction","anthropology; article; computer analysis; computer assisted tomography; computer graphics; fossil; human; human tissue; image reconstruction; incus; inner ear; microanalysis; morphometrics; priority journal; skull; virtual reality",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033120604

Deviations from developmental stability, arising from disruptive effects of environmental and genetic stresses, can be measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry, a particularly sensitive indicator of the ability to cope with these stresses during ontogeny. In an inbred Adriatic island population, we expected dental arch fluctuating asymmetry 1) to be higher than in an outbred sample from the same island, and 2) within this population, to increase with the level of inbreeding. Due to environmental stress, we also expected to find higher fluctuating asymmetry in the outbred island population than in an urban reference group from the same country. The material consisted of 506 dental casts of 253 children from 1) the island of Hvar, and 2) Zagreb, Croatia. Three-dimensional coordinates of 26 landmarks spanning the arches were digitized. The analysis partitioned the asymmetry of arch forms into components for directional and fluctuating bilateral asymmetry, using the appropriate Procrustes method (geometric morphometrics). The results corroborated the hypotheses. Fluctuating asymmetry was found to be higher on the island than in Zagreb in all groups and in both jaws, and increased significantly with endogamy level in the lower jaw. There was no significant directional asymmetry in the Zagreb sample and likewise none in the upper jaws of the outbred island group, but significant directional asymmetry in both jaws of the inbred population and also in the lower jaws of the outbred island group. These results suggest an environmental as well as a genetic influence on dental arch asymmetry. Although the lower jaws expressed these two stresses almost additively, the upper jaws appeared to be better buffered. The role of directional asymmetry as a potential indicator of craniofacial developmental instability clearly merits further attention. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Directional asymmetry; Endogamy; Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Human isolates","adolescent; anatomical variation; article; coping behavior; craniofacial development; Croatia; dental arch asymmetry; environmental factor; female; fluctuating asymmetry; genotype; geometry; heredity; human; inbreeding; jaw; male; morphometrics; ontogeny; school child; stress; tooth arch; Adolescent; Child; Consanguinity; Dental Arch; Europe, Eastern; Female; Geography; Humans; Male; Mandible",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-29244475055

Methods All cases involving free flap reconstruction for ORN of the mandible between 1998 and 2008 were reviewed. A defect classification scheme was developed. Flap selection and outcomes were analyzed and evaluated by defect type. Results Seventy-five free flaps and 13 pedicle flaps were performed in 63 patients. Total flap loss was 5%. Overall surgical complication was 32%. Complication rates were higher with bone flaps than with soft tissue flaps (p =.018). A full oral diet was tolerated in 57% of patients, whereas 26% required partial tube feeding, and 16% were tube-feeding dependent. Conclusion Free flap reconstruction of advanced ORN defects can be safely performed in a variety of flap configurations with good outcomes. The classification scheme may assist in flap selection.

Based on biological profiles, both the males and one of the females were tentatively identified and assigned names. The other two females were too similar in age and height, making skeletal separation and identification difficult. As a result, the Michigan State University Forensic Anthropology Laboratory assisted in the identification efforts by performing video skull-photo superimposition on the two unknown females. The skulls were compared to a photograph reported to be one of the missing females. By evaluating facial proportionality and by comparing a number of morphological features of the face and skulls, one skull was excluded as a possible match and one skull was not excluded as a match to the antemortem photo.

Yet the most effective multivariate statistics available pertain to labeled points (landmarks) only. In the finite-dimensional feature space that landmarks support, each case of a data set is equivalent to a deformation map deriving it from the average form. This paper introduces a new extension of the finite-dimensional spline-based approach for incorporating edge information. In this implementation edgels are restricted to landmark loci: they are interpreted as pairs of landmarks at infinitesimal separation in a specific direction. The effect of changing edge direction is a singular perturbation of the thin-plate spline for the landmarks alone. An appropriate normalization yields a basis for image deformations corresponding to changes of edge direction without landmark movement; this basis complements the basis of landmark deformations ignoring edge information. We derive explicit formulas for these edge warps, evaluate the quadratic form expressing bending energies of their formal combinations, and show the resulting spectrum of edge features in typical scenes. These expressions will aid all investigations into medical images that entail comparisons of anatomical scene analyses to a normative or typical form. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","deformable templates; edges; image averaging; morphometrics; thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000273848

Design/methodology/approach - Laser scanning data were used to create the 3D model of the damaged skull. Starting from this digital model, a virtual reconstruction of the missing part of the skull, based on the ideal symmetry with respect to the mid-sagittal plane, was achieved in a CAD environment. Finally, the custom-designed model was directly fabricated by means of the RP process. Findings - The result shows that the designed missing part of the skull fits very well with the existing skeletal remains. The final physical assembly of the prototyped element on the damaged skull was tested, restoring it to its whole original shape. Research limitations/implications - The entire process was time-consuming and may be applied just to the most representative skeletal remains. Practical implications - The method allows accurate fabrication of the missing part of the skull to be joined with the original skeletal remains.

In the latter, the integrity of the skull or a cranium is an important factor in successful identification. Here, we recommend the usage of computerized virtual reconstruction and geometric morphometrics for the purposes of individual reconstruction and identification in forensics. We apply these methods to reconstruct a complete cranium from facial remains that allegedly belong to the famous Italian humanist of the fifteenth century, Angelo Poliziano (1454-1494). Raw data was obtained by computed tomography scans of the Poliziano face and a complete reference skull of a 37-year-old Italian male. Given that the amount of distortion of the facial remains is unknown, two reconstructions are proposed: The first calculates the average shape between the original and its reflection, and the second discards the less preserved left side of the cranium under the assumption that there is no deformation on the right. Both reconstructions perform well in the superimposition with the original preserved facial surface in a virtual environment. The reconstruction by means of averaging between the original and reflection yielded better results during the superimposition with portraits of Poliziano. We argue that the combination of computerized virtual reconstruction and geometric morphometric methods offers a number of advantages over traditional plastic reconstruction, among which are speed, reproducibility, easiness of manipulation when superimposing with pictures in virtual environment, and assumptions control. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Cranium reconstruction; Geometric morphometrics; Superimposition techniques; Virtual anthropology","article; computer analysis; computer assisted tomography; computer model; forensic identification; fragmented cranium; human; image reconstruction; morphometrics; painting; physical anthropology; priority journal; skull; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Computer Simulation; Face; Famous Persons; Forensic Anthropology; History, 15th Century; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Italy; Male; Skull; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349190328

A physical reconstruction of the cranium was carried out by Tobias in 1967, who did not discuss problems related to deformation, although he noted a slight functional asymmetry. Nevertheless, the reconstructed cranium shows some anomalies, mainly due to the right skewed position of the upper calvariofacial fragment and uncertainty of the relative position of the neurocranium to the face, which hamper further quantitative analysis of OH5's cranial geometry. Here, we present a complete virtual reconstruction of OH5, using three-dimensional (3D) digital data, geometric morphometric (GM) methods and computer-aided design (CAD) techniques. Starting from a CT scan of Tobias's reconstruction, a semi-automatic segmentation method was used to remove Tobias's plaster. The upper calvariofacial fragment was separated from the lower facial fragment and re-aligned using superposition of their independent midsagittal planes in a range of feasible positions. The missing parts of the right hemiface were reconstructed using non-uniform rational basis-spline (NURBS) surface and subsequently mirrored using the midsagittal plane to arrive at a symmetrical facial reconstruction. A symmetric neurocranium was obtained as the average of the original shape and its mirrored version. The alignment between the two symmetric shapes (face and neurocranium) used their independent midsagittal plane and a reference shape (KNM-ER 406) to highly reduce their degrees of freedom. From the series of alternative reconstructions, we selected the middle of this rather small feasible range. When reconstructed as a range in this way, the whole cranial form of this unique specimen can be further quantified by comparative coordinate-based methods such as GM or can be used for finite element modeling (FEM) explorations of hypotheses about the mechanics of early hominin feeding and diets. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-aided design; Fossil reconstruction; Geometric morphometrics; Paranthropus boisei; Virtual anthropology","anthropology; cranium; fossil assemblage; hominid; morphometry; quantitative analysis; segmentation; Paranthropus boisei",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956153840

Since Dante's sepulchre will be opened in 2021, the reconstructive process is based on morphological and metric data collected on the poet's cranium during the formal identification of his remains in 1921 by the anthropologist Fabio Frassetto, as well as on the resulting plaster model. Starting from this plaster model and a morphologically compatible reference mandible, since the original mandible was never found, a 3D digital model of the complete skull was obtained by reverse engineering and virtual modelling techniques. The most important aspect in this work was the method of virtual modelling proposed for the ex novo generation of the mandible. The physical model of the skull (cranium + mandible) was then produced by means of a rapid prototyping system. This model was finally used to recreate Dante's face via traditional facial reconstruction techniques currently used in forensic anthropology. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The more knowledge available on this subject, the better a patient can be prepared and counseled. Patients and Methods: Patients undergoing mandibular resection with immediate insertion of a reconstruction plate and subsequent staged reconstruction for the management of locally aggressive lesions of the mandible at the University of California at San Francisco were studied over a 6-year period from 1999 to 2005. The staged reconstruction involved bone grafting, removal of the reconstruction plate, vestibuloplasty, implant insertion, and construction of an implant-supported prosthesis. Each patient completed a modified University of Washington Quality of Life version 4 questionnaire after reaching his or her highest level of reconstruction. Results: A total of 26 patients were identified as fulfilling the criteria for this study. Eight patients did not progress beyond resection, bone grafting, and subsequent removal of the bone plate. Seven patients progressed all the way through the 7 stages to an implant-supported prosthesis. The most important determinants of the patient's subsequent QOL were time interval from initial resection and stage of reconstruction; the greater the time interval from initial resection and the further the stage of reconstruction reached, the better the QOL. Resections involving the mandibular angle had a negative effect on appearance, and resections involving the parasymphysis and symphysis region carried a worse overall QOL, possibly due to difficulty with chewing and lip support. Males reached a higher overall QOL than females. Although most patients seemed satisfied with their overall QOL, 73% had some concerns regarding appearance, 42% had concerns with chewing, 42% had concerns regarding their mood, 35% felt more anxious since the surgery, 23% had some residual pain and discomfort, 19% had concerns with swallowing, and 15% had concerns with taste.

The partial cranium (about 2.5 million years old) is filled with stone matrix. The frontal part of the endocranium and most of the face are missing. Based on medical imaging techniques (computed tomography), we aimed to create virtual 3-dimensional reconstructions separately for the ectocranium and endocranium, reconstruct missing parts based on intraspecific comparison, estimate the endocranial capacity and describe endocranial morphological details that were physically inaccessible before. Methods: We mapped fossilized bone as distinct from stone matrix for every slice of the computed tomographic image, creating virtual endocasts. The missing endocranial parts were reconstructed, using thin-plate spline warping, from a reference specimen (STS 5, a complete A. africanus cranium). In contrast with previous studies, a large number of landmarks (8 anatomical and 455 semi-landmarks) were used for this reproducible reconstruction. Results: The endocranial capacity of the original partial cranium is 382 cm3, and the estimated volume for the reconstructed braincase is 440 cm3. On the left side of the endocast, signs of the meningeal vessel system could be detected. Transverse and sigmoid venous sinuses are present in MLD 37/38, whereas an occipital-marginal sinus system could not be found. Conclusions: The reconstructed endocranial capacity of MLD 37/38 lies within the range of other A. africanus specimens (428-515 cm3). In its dimensions, the endocast is similar to that of STS 5. The patterning of detected meningeal arterial branches resembles that of modern humans. The absence of an enlarged occipital-marginal sinus system is typical of A. africanus.",,"animal tissue; conference paper; diagnostic imaging; digital computer; hominid; image analysis; image reconstruction; measurement; nonhuman; paleoanthropology; paleopathology; skeleton; technique; three dimensional imaging; tissue slice; Animals; Cephalometry; Fossils; Haplorhini; History, Ancient; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Paleontology; Skull; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-5444242216

The skull from Hofmeyr, South Africa, which has been dated to c. 36. ka, is one of the only specimens known from this critical part of the late Pleistocene. The Hofmeyr skull was largely intact at the time of its discovery but has suffered post-recovery mishandling, with the resultant loss of most of the lower facial skeleton, the mandibular angle, the right mastoid process, and much of the occipital. Given the potential significance of this specimen, we have undertaken its restoration and reconstruction so as to provide a more complete picture of the cranial morphology of the late Pleistocene population from which it derived. On the basis of photographs, measurements, and morphological description recorded prior to its having been damaged, we reconstructed some of the missing bone in modeling clay on a high resolution plastic cast of the cranium. The original specimen was CT scanned, as was the cast with the reconstructed maxilla and mastoid; these scans were employed in the final computer reconstruction of the skull. Virtual reconstruction of the remainder of the cranium was accomplished using mirror-imaging and reference-based methods, employing 3D geometric morphometrics from a sample of recent human crania to compute coordinate-based estimates of the missing parts.

FA is often used as a marker of prenatal stress. The aim of this work is to estimate the symmetry of skulls from selected historic human populations and to analyse changes in their morphology which have taken place over centuries. The studied material consisted of two skull samples - a modern sample containing 82 skulls and a mediaeval sample of 77 skulls from Gródek on the Bug River. Radiographs were taken in postero-anterior (P-A) and base projections. Images were scanned and calibrated by means of MicroStation 95 Academic Edition software. Measurements of the skull images were used to estimate FA. All data were analysed statistically. The skulls in both samples showed asymmetry. The levels of FA varied in different skull regions. A high level of FA in the calvaria and a low asymmetry for the facial part of skull is characteristic of modern skulls. In mediaeval skulls these relations are inverted. The higher value of FA in modern skulls is an evidence of a higher level of developmental stress in the modern population as well as of its lesser abilities to resist stress. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

Similar technical challenges are present in paleoanthropology when considering fragmented and deformed mandibular and maxillary fossils. Sts 52, an Australopithecus africanus specimen from Sterkfontein Member 4, represents a typical case where the original shape of the dental arches is no longer preserved. It includes a partial lower face (Sts 52a) and a fragmented mandible (Sts 52b), both incomplete and damaged to such an extent to thwart attempts at matching upper and lower dentitions. We show how the preserved macrowear pattern of the tooth crowns can be used to functionally reconstruct Sts 52's dental arches. High-resolutiondental stone casts of Sts 52 maxillary and mandibular dentition were mounted and repositioned in a dental articulator. The occlusal relationship between antagonists was restored based on the analysis of the occlusal wear pattern of each preserved tooth, considering all dental contact movements represented in the occlusal compass. The reconstructed dental arches were three-dimensional surface scanned and their occlusal kinematics tested in a simulation. The outcome of this contribution is the first functional restoration of A. africanus dental arches providing new morphometric data for specimen Sts 52. It is noteworthy that the method described in this case study might be applied to several other fossilspecimens.

Materials and Methods: A total of 15 skulls were scanned using computed tomography, and a virtual osteotomy of the left zygomatic bone was performed. Next, virtual reconstructions of the missing part using mirror imaging (with and without best fit registration) and thin plate spline interpolation functions were compared with the original left zygomatic bone. Results: In general, reconstructions using thin plate spline warping showed better results than the mirroring approaches. Nevertheless, when dealing with skulls characterized by a low degree of asymmetry, mirror imaging and subsequent registration can be considered a valid and easy solution for zygomatic bone reconstruction. Conclusions: The mirroring tool is one of the possible alternatives in reconstruction, but it might not always be the optimal solution (ie, when the hemifaces are asymmetrical). In the present pilot study, we have verified that best fit registration of the mirrored unaffected hemiface and thin plate spline warping achieved better results in terms of fitting accuracy, overcoming the evident limits of the mirroring approach. © 2011 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",,"adult; article; bone remodeling; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; computer simulation; controlled study; face asymmetry; female; human; image reconstruction; intermethod comparison; male; osteotomy; pilot study; registration; skull; three dimensional imaging; virtual reconstruction; zygoma; Adolescent; Adult; Cephalometry; Computer Simulation; Facial Asymmetry; Facial Bones; Female; Frontal Bone; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Maxilla; Middle Aged; Models, Anatomic; Orbit; Osteotomy; Pilot Projects; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Skull; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Temporal Bone; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult; Zygoma",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953200444

Particularly, within the disciplines of orthodontics and surgery, the main goal of reconstruction is to restore or create ex novo the proper form and function. The reconstruction of the mandibular condyle requires restoration of articulation, occlusion, and mastication from the functional side as well as the correct shape of the mandible from the esthetic point of view. Meeting all these demands is still problematic for surgeons. It is unfortunate that the collaboration between anthropologists and medical professionals is still limited. Nowadays, geometric morphometric methods (GMM) are routinely applied in shape analysis and increasingly in the reconstruction of missing data in skeletal material in paleoanthropology. Together with methods for three-dimensional (3D) digital model construction and reverse engineering, these methods could prove to be useful in surgical fields for virtual planning of operations and the production of customized biocompatible scaffolds. In this contribution, we have reconstructed the missing left condylar process of the mandible belonging to a famous Italian humanist of the 15th century, Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494) by means of 3D digital models and GMM, having first compared two methods (a simple reflection of the opposite side and the mathematical-statistical GMM approach) in a complete human mandible on which loss of the left condyle was virtually simulated. Finally, stereolithographic models of Pico's skull were prototyped providing the physical assembly of the bony skull structures with a high fitting accuracy. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Condylar process; Geometric morphometrics; Stereolithography; Virtual anthropology","tissue scaffold; accuracy; anthropology; article; biocompatibility; bone remodeling; esthetics; functional anatomy; human; image reconstruction; mandible condyle; mastication; morphometrics; paleoanthropology; priority journal; surgical technique; temporomandibular joint; three dimensional imaging; tissue engineering; tooth occlusion; treatment planning; Cephalometry; Computer Simulation; Famous Persons; History, 15th Century; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Italy; Mandibular Condyle; Visible Human Projects; Della",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349136317

This is particularly important within the disciplines such as orthodontics and surgery, when dealing with mandibular defects due to tumors, developmental abnormalities, or trauma. In such cases, proper restorations of both form (for esthetic purposes) and function (restoration of articulation, occlusion, and mastication) are required. Several digital approaches based on three-dimensional (3D) digital modeling, computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing techniques, and more recently geometric morphometric methods have been used to solve this problem. Nevertheless, comparisons among their outcomes are rarely provided. In this contribution, three methods for hemimandibular body reconstruction have been tested. Two bone defects were virtually simulated in a 3D digital model of a human hemimandible. Accordingly, 3D digital scaffolds were obtained using the mirror copy of the unaffected hemimandible (Method 1), the thin plate spline (TPS) interpolation (Method 2), and the combination between TPS and CAD techniques (Method 3). The mirror copy of the unaffected hemimandible does not provide a suitable solution for bone restoration. The combination between TPS interpolation and CAD techniques (Method 3) produces an almost perfect-fitting 3D digital model that can be used for biocompatible custom-made scaffolds generated by rapid prototyping technologies. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","CAD; Customized scaffold; Geometric morphometrics; Mandibular reconstruction; Virtual anthropology","adult; article; bone defect; case report; computer aided design; human; image reconstruction; intermethod comparison; mandible; priority journal; simulation; three dimensional imaging; virtual reality; Adult; Bone Transplantation; Computer-Aided Design; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Mandible; Models, Anatomic; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959192950
