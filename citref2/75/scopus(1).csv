As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

From anterior to posterior, the dentition is divided into regions of incisor, canine, premolar and molar tooth types. Particularly teeth in the molar region are very diverse in shape. The development of individual teeth involves epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that are mediated by signals shared with other organs. Parts of the molecular details of signaling networks have been established, particularly in the signal families BMP, FGF, Hh and Wnt, mostly by the analysis of gene expression and signaling responses in knockout mice with arrested tooth development. Recent evidence suggests that largely the same signaling cascade is used reiteratively throughout tooth development. The successional determination of tooth region, tooth type, tooth crown base and individual cusps involves signals that regulate tissue growth and differentiation. Tooth type appears to be determined by epithelial signals and to involve differential activation of homeobox genes in the mesenchyme. This differential signaling could have allowed the evolutionary divergence of tooth shapes among the four tooth types. The advancing tooth morphogenesis is punctuated by transient signaling centers in the epithelium corresponding to the initiation of tooth buds, tooth crowns and individual cusps. The latter two signaling centers, the primary enamel knot and the secondary enamel knot, have been well characterized and are thought to direct the differential growth and subsequent folding of the dental epithelium. Several members of the FGF signal family have been implicated in the control of cell proliferation around the non-dividing enamel knots. Spatiotemporal induction of the secondary enamel knots determines the cusp patterns of individual teeth and is likely to involve repeated activation and inhibition of signaling as suggested for patterning of other epithelial organs.

The resultant phylogeny is exceptionally robust and illuminates events in primate evolution from ancient to recent, clarifying numerous taxonomic controversies and providing new data on human evolution. Ongoing speciation, reticulate evolution, ancient relic lineages, unequal rates of evolution, and disparate distributions of insertions/deletions among the reconstructed primate lineages are uncovered.

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

Significant correlations were found between pairs of allometrically standardized dimensions which measure the same molar function (shearing, crushing, or grinding). Correlations between pairs of dimensions which do not measure the same function are not significant. Second molar adaptations for shearing, crushing, and grinding, as well as the length of the second lower molar, and the total surface of the post‐canine dentition are negatively allometric with respect to metabolic rate. Species which take different proportions of fruit, leaves, and insects in their diets have different molar structure. Frugivores have small teeth for their adult body size with poorly developed shearing, crushing, and grinding features on their molars. By contrast, leaf‐eating species tend to have large teeth for their adult body size with well developed shearing, crushing, and grinding. The second molars of insectivorous species were found to parallel closely those of leaf‐eating species. The two groups are clearly distinguishable from the former on the basis of body size alone: the smallest living primate leaf‐eater is on order of magnitude larger than the largest living primate insectivore.

On entry, patients were allocated at random to receive once daily topical applications of one or other drug over a period of 2 to 4 weeks, treatment being stopped when patients had recovered or substantially improved. Clinical and mycological assessments were made before (baseline), at weekly intervals during treatment and, if possible, 2 to 3 weeks after the end of treatment (drug-free period). Treatment was continued for 19.25 days with fenticonazole and 19.62 days with naftifine. All patients had positive mycological findings on entry. The most frequently isolated pathogens were dermatophytes, mainly Trichophyton rubrum; however, Candida albicans was present in 33.3% of patients in the fenticonazole group and in 20.8% of those treated with naftifine. At the end of treatment, only 3 (6.3%) and 5 (10.4%) patients, respectively, of the 48 patients assessed in each group still had positive mycological findings. Assessments of symptoms indicated comparable, significant improvement in both groups, and at the end of treatment the overall opinion of doctors and patients was that about 90% of patients were cured or greatly improved. The end of the drug-free period evaluation showed that, of the patients assessed as cured or greatly improved at the end of treatment, only 1 (3.2%) patient who had received fenticonazole and 2 (6.3%) who had received naftifine were confirmed mycologically as having relapsed. Local burning after topical application of the spray was the only side-effect reported by 4 (8.2%) of 49 patients on naftifine and 3 (6%) of 50 patients on fenticonazole, 1 of whom voluntarily interrupted treatment.

Most of this change has been due to the development and adoption of methods to analyze the Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks. These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

Tooth cusp formation commences at cap-stage with the appearance of the enamel knot, which is a cluster of non-dividing epithelial cells. In this study, enamel knot was first seen in embryonic mice molar teeth at the onset of cap-stage. Later in tooth development, secondary enamel knot structures were observed at the cusp tips and their appearance corresponded to the formation of individual cusp morphology. Comparisons of the pattern of cell proliferation in embryonic mouse molars and the expression of fibroblast growth factor-4 (Fgf-4) gene revealed that expression of Fgf-4 mRNA is strictly localized to the non-dividing cells of the enamel knot. However, when FGF-4 protein was introduced onto isolated dental tissues in vitro, it stimulated the proliferation of both dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Based on these results, we suggest that the enamel knot may control tooth morphogenesis by concurrently stimulating cusp growth (via FGF-4 synthesis) and by directing folding of cusp slopes (by not proliferating itself).","Cell proliferation; Enamel knot; Fgf-4; Tooth development","fibroblast growth factor; animal tissue; article; cell proliferation; embryo; enamel; histology; morphogenesis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; tooth crown; tooth development; Animal; Cell Division; Dental Enamel; Dental Papilla; Epithelium; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Mesoderm; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred CBA; Molar; Morphogenesis; Odontogenesis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; RNA, Messenger; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027998109

The purpose of morphometric studies is considered, together with issues relating to the nature, significance and identification of landmarks before turning to a review of available technologies for the analysis of morphological variation. These are considered in terms of underlying models and assumptions in order to clarify when each is appropriate. To illustrate the application of these methods, 3 example studies are presented. The first examines differences amongst ancient and modern adult human crania using 2-dimensional data. The second illustrates the extension of these methods into 3 dimensions in a study of facial growth in monkeys. The third presents an application to the analysis of the form of the hominoid talus.

Dental characters are particularly central for inferring phylogenetic relationships of fossil taxa, of which teeth are often the only recovered part. The use of different aspects of dental morphology as phylogenetic signals implies the independence of dental characters from each other. Here we report, however, that, at least developmentally, most dental characters may be nonindependent. We investigated how three different levels of the cell signalling protein ectodysplasin (Eda) changed dental characters in mouse. We found that with increasing expression levels of this one gene, the number of cusps increases, cusp shapes and positions change, longitudinal crests form, and number of teeth increases. The consistent modification of characters related to lateral placement of cusps can be traced to a small difference in the formation of an early signalling centre at the onset of tooth crown formation.

T6G 2G1, Canada","Nontraditional or geometric morphometric methods have found wide application in the biological sciences, especially in anthropology, a field with a strong history of measurement of biological form. Controversy has arisen over which method is the ""best"" for quantifying the morphological difference between forms and for making proper statistical statements about the detected differences. This paper explains that many of these arguments are superfluous to the real issues that need to be understood by those wishing to apply morphometric methods to biological data. Validity, the ability of a method to find the correct answer, is rarely discussed and often ignored. We explain why demonstration of validity is a necessary step in the evaluation of methods used in morphometrics. Focusing specifically on landmark data, we discuss the concepts of size and shape, and reiterate that since no unique definition of size exists, shape can only be recognized with reference to a chosen surrogate for size. We explain why only a limited class of information related to the morphology of an object can be known when landmark data are used. This observation has genuine consequences, as certain morphometric methods are based on models that require specific assumptions, some of which exceed what can be known from landmark data. We show that orientation of an object with reference to other objects in a sample can never be known, because this information is not included in landmark data. Consequently, a descriptor of form difference that contains information on orientation is flawed because that information does not arise from evidence within the data, but instead is a product of a chosen orientation scheme. To illustrate these points, we apply superimposition, deformation, and linear distance-based morphometric methods to the analysis of a simulated data set for which the true differences are known. This analysis demonstrates the relative efficacy of various methods to reveal the true difference between forms. Our discussion is intended to be fair, but it will be obvious to the reader that we favor a particular approach. Our bias comes from the realization that morphometric methods should operate with a definition of form and form difference consistent with the limited class of information that can be known from landmark data. Answers based on information that can be known from the data are of more use to biological inquiry than those based on unjustifiable assumptions.

Whereas studies of development and mathematical models of development may offer new insights into the genotypeĝ€""phenotype map, the challenge is to make them useful at the level of microevolution. Here we report a computational model of mammalian tooth development that combines parameters of genetic and cellular interactions to produce a three-dimensional tooth from a simple tooth primordia. We systematically tinkered with each of the model parameters to generate phenotypic variation and used geometric morphometric analyses to identify, or developmentally ordinate, parameters best explaining population-level variation of real teeth. To model the full range of developmentally possible morphologies, we used a population sample of ringed seals (Phoca hispida ladogensis). Seal dentitions show a high degree of variation, typically linked to the lack of exact occlusion. Our model suggests that despite the complexity of development and teeth, there may be a simple basis for dental variation. Changes in single parameters regulating signalling during cusp development may explain shape variation among individuals, whereas a parameter regulating epithelial growth may explain serial, tooth-to-tooth variation along the jaw. Our study provides a step towards integrating the genotype, development and the phenotype. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In contrast to recent mtDNA phylogenies, Y chromosome loci support four monophyletic species groups, including a sinica group containing M. arctoides - a classification largely congruent with those of Fooden and Delson. Comparison of mtDNA and Y chromosome phylogenies highlight (1) a potential hybrid origin of Macaca arctoides from M. fascicularis and proto-M, assamensis/thibetana and (2) cases of mitochondrial paraphyly in macaque species whose Y chromosome lineages are monophyletic - a probable evolutionary consequence of philopatric females vs dispersing males.

The primates are among the most broadly studied mammalian orders, with the published literature containing extensive analyses of their behavior, physiology, genetics and ecology. The importance of this group in medical and biological research is well appreciated, and explains the numerous molecular phylogenies that have been proposed for most primate families and genera. Composite estimates for the entire order have been infrequently attempted, with the last phylogenetic reconstruction spanning the full range of primate evolutionary relationships having been conducted over a decade ago. Results. To estimate the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history, we employed Bayesian phylogenetic methods to analyze data supermatrices comprising 7 mitochondrial genes (6,138 nucleotides) from 219 species across 67 genera and 3 nuclear genes (2,157 nucleotides) from 26 genera. Many taxa were only partially represented, with an average of 3.95 and 5.43 mitochondrial genes per species and per genus, respectively, and 2.23 nuclear genes per genus. Our analyses of mitochondrial DNA place Tarsiiformes as the sister group of Strepsirrhini. Within Haplorrhini, we find support for the primary divergence of Pitheciidae in Platyrrhini, and our results suggest a sister grouping of African and non-African colobines within Colobinae and of Cercopithecini and Papionini within Cercopthecinae. Date estimates for nodes within each family and genus are presented, with estimates for key splits including: Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini 64 million years ago (MYA), Lemuriformes-Lorisiformes 52 MYA, Platyrrhini-Catarrhini 43 MYA and Cercopithecoidea-Hominoidea 29 MYA. Conclusion. We present an up-to-date, comprehensive estimate of the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history. Although considerable gaps remain in our knowledge of the primate phylogeny, increased data sampling, particularly from nuclear loci, will be able to provide further resolution.",,"mitochondrial DNA; article; Bayes theorem; Catarrhini; cell nucleus; Cercopithecini; Cercopithecoidea; Cercopithecus; Cercopthecinae; Colobinae; familia; genetic variability; genus; Haplorhini; Haplorrhini; Hominoidea; Lemuriformes; Lorisiformes; mammal; mitochondrial gene; molecular evolution; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Papionini; Pitheciidae; Platyrrhini; primate; prosimian; sequence analysis; sister group; Strepsirrhini; supermatrix approach; tarsier; animal; Bayes theorem; classification; DNA sequence; genetics; human; mitochondrion; phylogeny; primate; time; Catarrhini; Cercopithecini; Cercopithecoidea; Colobinae; Hominoidea; Lemuriformes; Lorisiformes; Mammalia; Papionini; Pitheciidae; Platyrrhini; Primates; Strepsirhini; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Cell Nucleus; Humans; Mitochondria; Phylogeny; Primates; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-72149127147

It aims to establish the extent to which the distinctive features of adult representatives of these populations are present in the early post natal period and to what extent population differences in ontogenetic scaling and allometric trajectories contribute to distinct facial forms. The analyses utilize configurations of facial landmarks and are carried out using geometric morphometric methods. The results of this study show that modern human populations can be distinguished based on facial shape alone, irrespective of age or sex, indicating the early presence of differences. Additionally, some populations have statistically distinct facial ontogenetic trajectories that lead to the development of further differences later in ontogeny. We conclude that population-specific facial morphologies develop principally through distinctions in facial shape probably already present at birth and further accentuated and modified to variable degrees during growth. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the plasticity of facial growth patterns in modern humans. Further, they have important implications in relation to the study of growth in the face of fossil hominins and in relation to the possibility of developing effective discriminant functions for the identification of population affinities of immature facial skeletal material. Such tools would be of value in archaeological, forensic and anthropological applications. The findings of this study underline the need to examine more deeply, and in more detail, the ontogenetic basis of other causes of craniometric variation, such as sexual dimorphism and hominin species differentiation.","Allometric vectors; Craniofacial variation; Facial ontogeny","adolescent; adult; allometry; anthropology; archeology; article; controlled study; craniofacial development; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; face; face growth; facial bone; female; forensic medicine; fossil; geometry; human; human experiment; male; normal human; perinatal period; plasticity; population differentiation; population research; priority journal; sex difference; species differentiation; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Continental Population Groups; Facial Bones; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maxillofacial Development; Morphogenesis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036737886

Development may constrain as well as facilitate evolution of new tooth shapes, affecting how reliable dental characters are in phylogenetic studies. Much of the genetic machinery of development uses the same genes among different organs, including teeth, limbs, and feathers. Furthermore, within a tooth, the development of individual cusps repeatedly uses the same set of developmental genes, forming a ""developmental module."" The repeated activation of the developmental module can explain the cumulative variation in later-developing cusps. Therefore short, later-developing cusps may be evolvable but also more homoplastic. This patterning cascade mode of cusp development can be used to explain the variational properties of dental characters and character states related to cusp initiation. The developmental basis and variational properties of crown termination, cusp shape, and cusp configuration characters are currently less well understood. It is unlikely that there is a simple ""gene to phenotype"" map for dental characters. Rather, the whole cusp pattern is a product of a dynamic developmental program manifested in the activation of the developmental modules. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Dental traits; Dentition; Evolvability; Morphogenesis; Teeth",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000093272

Recent studies suggest that their overall dental pattern (i.e., in morphologic trait frequencies) is also unique. However, what this means in a phylogenetic sense is not known. Although exploring the polarity of dental morphologic characters is essential to understanding the phylogenetic implications of unique patterns of variation, few have undertaken this task. This study moves beyond standard scoring methods, which are based on modern humans, to include several postcanine traits that have not been considered previously. In addition, Homo erectus is used as an outgroup to Neanderthals and modern humans to explore the polarity of these traits. The findings of this study suggest that Neanderthals are not only unique in their pattern of dental trait frequencies (as found in previous studies) but that they present several dental autapomorphies, as well. These include a high frequency of the mid-trigonid crest in lower molars and unique morphology of the lower premolars. Interestingly, these characters are not observed in the Mauer mandible, which some have claimed to be a member of a chronospecies that is a unique ancestor to Neanderthals. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Comparative anatomy; Dental morphology; Hominoid postcanine teeth; Homo erectus; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Human evolution; Neanderthals","article; comparative anatomy; dentition; evolution; hominid; homo erectus; Homo heidelbergensis; homo sapiens; human; incisor; mandible; molar tooth; morphology; Neanderthal; premolar tooth; priority journal; scoring system; tooth development; animal; anthropometry; biological model; classification; comparative study; evolution; fossil; histology; history; hominid; methodology; physical anthropology; review; Animal; Anthropometry; Comparative Study; Dentition, Permanent; Evolution; Fossils; History of Medicine, Ancient; Hominidae; Human; Mandible; Models, Biological; Paleodontology; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Animals; Anthropometry; Evolution; History, Ancient; Humans; Models, Biological; Hominoidea; Homo; Homo erectus; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037096089

The supermatrix was analysed using a gene-partitioned maximum likelihood approach to obtain an exhaustive molecular phylogenetic framework. All clades recovered from recent molecular works were upheld in our analyses demonstrating that the presence of missing data did not bias our supermatrix inference. The resulting phylogenetic tree was subsequently dated with a molecular dating method to provide a timescale for speciation events. Results obtained from our relaxed molecular clock analyses concurred with previous works based on the same fossil constraints. The resulting dated tree allowed to infer of macroevolutionary processes among the primates. Shifts in diversification rate and speciation rates were determined using the SymmeTREE method and a birthdeath process. No significant asymmetry was detected for the primate clade, but significant shifts in diversification rate were identified for seven clades: Anthropoidea, Lemuriformes, Lemuridae, Galagidae, Callithrix genus, the Cercopithecinae and Asian Macaca. Comparisons with previous primate supertree results reveal that (i) there was a diversification event at the root of the Lemuriformes, (ii) a higher diversification rate is detected for Cercopithecidae and Anthropoidea and (iii) a shift in diversification is always recovered for Macaca genus. Macroevolutionary inferences and primate divergence dates show that major primate diversification events occurred after the Paleogene, suggesting the extinction of ancient primate lineages. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Among the principal difficulties in these evaluations is the absence of discrete, discernible, and comparable anatomical structures for rigorous quantitative assessment. Previous research has addressed either internal crown surface features (such as cusps and fossae) or the morphology of the crown outline. In the present paper, we integrate both types of information in the examination of morphological variation of lower P4s (n = 96) among various fossil hominin species with an emphasis on genus Homo. We use a set of 34 2D landmarks combining coordinate data from four classical dental landmarks on the occlusal surface and 30 sliding semilandmarks of the crown outline. Our results indicate that external shape variation is closely related to the configuration of the occlusal morphological features and influenced by dental size. The external and internal shapes of P4 are polymorphic but still useful in depicting a primitive-derived gradient. The primitive pattern seems to have been an asymmetrical contour with a mesially displaced metaconid, development of a bulging talonid, and a broad occlusal polygon. The trend toward dental reduction during the Pleistocene produced different morphological variants with a reduced occlusal polygon and decreased lingual occlusal surface in later Homo species.

Molars of Callithrix and Alouatta are adapted to loading foods under relatively high occlusal pressure; those of Pithecia and Cebus, under relatively low occlusal pressure. General functional considerations suggest that these taxa are adapted to insectivorous, folivorous, frugivorous and omnivorous diets, respectively. The physical properties of foods, principally mechanical strength and deformability, determine the selective pressures involved in the evolutionary adaptation of molar form. A dietary classification based upon percentages of foods eaten does not always reflect morphological adaptations.

Usually these analyses have been performed by means of classic morphometric methods, including the measurement of relative cusp areas or the angles defined between cusps. Although these studies have provided valuable information for the morphological characterization of some hominin species, we believe that the analysis of this particular tooth could be more conclusive for taxonomic assignment. In this study, we have applied geometric morphometric methods to explore the morphological variability of the upper first molar (M1) across the human fossil record. Our emphasis focuses on the study of the phenetic relationships among the European middle Pleistocene populations (designated as H. heidelbergensis) with H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, but the inclusion of Australopithecus and early Homo specimens has helped us to assess the polarity of the observed traits. H. neanderthalensis presents a unique morphology characterized by a relatively distal displacement of the lingual cusps and protrusion in the external outline of a large and bulging hypocone. This morphology can be found in a less pronounced degree in the European early and middle Pleistocene populations, and reaches its maximum expression with the H. neanderthalensis lineage. In contrast, modern humans retain the primitive morphology with a square occlusal polygon associated with a round external outline. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers have specifically referred to the tufted capuchin as a seed predator. Craniofacial features exhibited by the tufted capuchin, such as thick cortical bone in the mandibular corpus and symphysis, and a broad face associated with large masticatory muscles, permit the production and dissipation of relatively high masticatory forces. These morphologies, however, cannot distinguish between the tufted capuchin's propensity to exert higher forces when opening food with its anterior dentition or with its cheek teeth. It is also unclear whether these are adaptations for biting or chewing foods. This study uses a constrained lever model to compare the masticatory adaptations of C. apella to other cebids and atelids. Results show that the temporalis and masseter muscles in C. apella and C. olivaceus are more anteriorly positioned relative to nine other platyrrhine taxa. This condition, which appears to be ancestral among the Cebinae, increases force production at the incisors and canines while compromising third molar function. Cebus apella, has exaggerated this pattern. Field data on dietary toughness show that both capuchins typically select foods of low toughness, but on occasion, C. apella ingests food items of exceptional toughness. Thus, C. apella appears to maintain these biomechanical relationships by producing particularly high but relatively infrequent bite forces, particularly at the incisors and canines. However, adaptations for anterior dental use do not tightly constrain the diet of Cebus apella. This approach can be used to clarify the dietary adaptations of fossil taxa. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

When this model is applied to functional or evolutionary questions, it is commonly assumed that the muscles of mastication vary little in activity during biting at points along the tooth row. A pattern of smoothly increasing maximum bite force magnitudes is therefore predicted as the bite point is moved posteriorly along the dental arcade. Diverse adaptive explanations are mapped onto this pattern. In this study, the activity of the superficial masseter and anterior temporalis muscles in humans was quantified during high magnitude bite force production at points along the tooth row. These data indicate that there are substantial changes in muscle activity with bite point, and that the standard lever model is therefore an incomplete description of masticatory force production. Maximum muscle force magnitudes were found to be greatest during first molar biting and to decrease as the bite point moved anteriorly and posteriorly. Additionally, relative balancing and working side muscle activity changed by bite point. This latter pattern is consistent with the predictions of Greaves' constrained lever model, which assumes that masticatory muscle activity is restricted by the need to maintain compressive forces at both temporomandibular joints. However, these results also imply that additional factors influence muscle activity - such as dental morphology, mandibular kinematics, and the need to safeguard against joint distraction during diverse loading conditions - and that the constrained lever model of Greaves is therefore also incomplete. These considerations suggest that masticatory system morphology in primates will respond differently to dietary selection pressures than is commonly hypothesized. Intepretations of cranial morphology in fossil taxa may therefore also differ. © 1998 Academic Press Limited.","Constraint; Dietary adaptation; Electromyography; Humans; Jaw biomechanics; Masticatory muscles; Temporomandibular joint; Tooth support","biomechanics; masticatory system; primate; adult; article; biological model; biomechanics; electromyography; electrophysiology; female; human; male; mastication; masticatory muscle; mouth and teeth; physiology; skeletal muscle; Adult; Biomechanics; Bite Force; Electromyography; Electrophysiology; Female; Humans; Male; Masticatory Muscles; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Stomatognathic System; Hominidae; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031810582

Z‐scores calculated from geometric predictions for several features of the feeding apparatus thought to have some functional significance (e. g., tooth dimensions, jaw robusticity, leverage of primary jaw elevators) are compared to a profile of the naturalistic dietary behavior of these species (i. e., proportions of fruit mesocarp, seeds, leaves, and fauna eaten). Several features are found exclusively in those platyrrhines whose dietary preferences are the most limited. Such specializations appear to be associated with a particular protein source exploited by a species to supplement a largely frugivorous diet. Ateles paniscus, which feeds primarily on the mesocarp of ripe fruit, has an adaptive morphology that emphasizes broad incisors. Chiropotes satanas (and to a slightly lesser extent, Pithecia pithecia) is a frugivore/seed predator with large upper and lower canines and a robust mandible. The frugivore/folivore Alouatta seniculus has a relatively large total molar area and effective mandibular condyle height. In all four of these strictly vegetarian species, the leverage of the masseter muscle is greater than that of temporalis. Of the omnivorous species, Cebus apella and C. nigrivittatus exploit both fauna and seeds for protein and exhibit an array of many of the above features, such as large teeth and thick mandibles. Saimiri sciureus, not particularly known for seed predation, departs from Cebus in having less robust canines and a more gracile mandible. All three cebid omnivores have a temporalis with greater leverage than the masseter, indicating a requirement for resisting anteriorly directed forces, for example, using the jaws for vigorous foraging. The lack of any enlarged features, other than incisors, in the omnivorous Saguinus midas may be attributable to the functional constraints of small body size. Because the small size of the gape limits the size of the food parcel ingested, a requirement to enlarge other dentomandibular structures for trituration is alleviated.

After the analysis of the lower second premolar and the upper first molar crown shapes, we apply the same technique to lower first premolar morphology. Our results show a clear distinction between the morphology seen in earlier hominin taxa such as Australopithecus and African early Homo, as well as Asian H. erectus, and more recent groups such as European H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens. The morphology of the earlier hominins includes an asymmetrical outline, a conspicuous talonid, and an occlusal polygon that tends to be large. The morphology of the recent hominins includes a symmetrical outline and a reduced or absent talonid. Within this later group, premolars belonging to H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis tend to possess a small and mesiolingually-displaced occlusal polygon, whereas H. sapiens specimens usually present expanded and centered occlusal polygons in an almost circular outline. The morphological differences among Paranthropus, Australopithecus, and African early Homo as studied here are small and evolutionarily less significant compared to the differences between the earlier and later homin taxa.

Molar occlusal shape correlates with diet in living mammals, so teeth are a potentially useful structure from which to reconstruct diet in extinct taxa. We assess the efficacy of Dirichlet normal energy (DNE) calculated for molar tooth surfaces for reflecting diet. We evaluate DNE, which uses changes in normal vectors to characterize curvature, by directly comparing this metric to metrics previously used in dietary inference. We also test whether combining methods improves diet reconstructions. The study sample consisted of 146 lower (mandibular) second molars belonging to 24 euarchontan taxa. Five shape quantification metrics were calculated on each molar: DNE, shearing quotient, shearing ratio, relief index, and orientation patch count rotated (OPCR). Statistical analyses were completed for each variable to assess effects of taxon and diet. Discriminant function analysis was used to assess ability of combinations of variables to predict diet. Values differ significantly by diets for all variables, although shearing ratios and OPCR do not distinguish statistically between insectivores and folivores or omnivores and frugivores. Combined analyses were much more effective at predicting diet than any metric alone. Alone, relief index and DNE were most effective at predicting diet. OPCR was the least effective alone but is still valuable as the only quantitative measure of surface complexity. Of all methods considered, DNE was the least methodologically sensitive, and its effectiveness suggests it will be a valuable tool for dietary reconstruction. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","dental topography; orientation patch count; primates; relief index; shearing quotient","article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; dirichlet normal energy; folivore; food preference; frugivore; insectivore; nonhuman; omnivore; relief index; taxon; tooth arch; tooth crown; tooth size; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Diet; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Molar; Strepsirhini; Tooth Crown; Tooth Wear; Tupaia; X-Ray Microtomography",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956218110

This study examined variation in trigonid crest patterns on the enamel and dentine surfaces to (1) evaluate the concordance between the morphology of trigonid crests at the inner dentine and the outer enamel surfaces; (2) examine their developmental origin(s); and (3) examine trait polarity through comparison with Australopithecus africanus and Pan. The sample included 73 H. neanderthalensis, 67 contemporary H. sapiens, 5 A. africanus, and 24 Pan lower molars. Results indicate general agreement in the morphology observed on the dentine and enamel surfaces. All but one H. neanderthalensis molar shows some trigonid crest development, whereas trigonid crests occur in low frequency in contemporary humans. Pan and A. africanus both also show high frequencies of a continuous trigonid crest. However, the origin of the trigonid crest differs among groups. H. neanderthalensis uniquely possesses a 'middle' trigonid crest that originates from the mesial accessory ridge of one or both cusps. Based on our results we suggest that presence of a continuous middle trigonid crest at the dentine surface is primitive and the lack of any trigonid crest is derived. Genetic drift may explain the high frequency of trigonid crests in H.neanderthalensis. However, H. neanderthalensis still appears to be derived relative to Pan and A. africanus in its high frequency of the mesial-mesial trigonid crest configuration.

However, the evolutionary relationships among these arboreal congeners remain poorly resolved. The present work marks the first attempt to reconstruct the history of this group through the phylogenetic analysis of long nuclear sequences. We surveyed 19 guenons and seven outgroup taxa for a ∼9.3 kb fragment of X-chromosomal DNA homologous to a portion of human Xq13.3. Parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of these sequences consistently recover two strongly-supported patterns within the arboreal Cercopithecus clade: (1) a clustering of members of the cephus and mitis species groups, and (2) a monophyletic aggregate including the mona, neglectus, and diana species groups. Although guenons occasionally hybridize in the wild, interbreeding forms of different species groups do not cluster together as sister-taxa in the X-chromosomal tree, suggesting that the two clades inferred here are not reticulate patterns due to recent gene flow. These clades are most likely the result of either ancestral hybridization or true phylogenetic history. We advocate the latter explanation because the same two aggregates (cephus/mitis and mona/neglectus/diana) are recovered, albeit with weak support, by a number of earlier analyses. Finally, X-chromosomal divergence dates are estimated for a number of nodes in the guenon radiation. The divergence of guenon and papionin lineages at 11.5 (±1.3) MYA appears to be a particularly robust estimate since it is inferred from both mitochondrial and X-chromosomal studies, each using different fossil calibration points. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

But when geometric morphometrics are combined with distance-based phylogenetics molar shape divergence appears to record population-level phylogeny, a fact that allows extant and fossil populations to be combined in a single phylogeographic study. The European Sorex araneus complex -a genetically complicated group composed of multiple karyotypic races and species - illustrates the principle. The phylogeographic patterns revealed by molar shape broadly agree with scenarios based on molecular data and circumstantial evidence. Importantly, the inclusion of fossil samples of known age allows minimum divergence times to be inferred. Some races of S. araneus may have diverged more than 120,000 years ago, but others may have diverged less than 14,000. Supporting evidence that molar shape can be used to reconstruct phylogeographic relationships comes from strong correlations between molar shape distances and both phylogenetic divergence time and cytochrome b sequence divergence in datasets where these variables are known independently (fossil carnivorans from a well-constrained stratigraphic setting and shrew species of the genus Sorex, respectively). However, molar shape may have a 'saturation point' beyond which it is not applicable.","Geometric morphometrics; Hybrid zones; Molar shape; Molecular clocks; Phylogeography; Post-glacial recolonization; Procrustes distance; Sorex; Viverravidae","Animals; Female; Fossils; Karyotyping; Male; Molar; Phylogeny; Shrews; Skull; Time; Araneus; Mammalia; Procrustes; Sorex; Sorex araneus; Viverravidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035708054

However, our understanding of variation in tooth-root form is limited. Studies within the clinical literature emphasize the influence of tooth-root surface area on stress resistance, but it is not known if root form has diversified during primate evolution in relation to dietary specialization. This hypothesis was tested by quantifying maxillary canine and postcanine tooth-root surface areas in four platyrrhine species that differ in the material properties of their diet: Cebus apella, Cebus albifrons, Chiropotes satanas, and Pithecia pithecia. Pairwise comparisons between closely related taxa support predictions based on dietary differences. Taxa that regularly consume resistant seeds (Cebus apella and Chiropotes satanas) exhibit significantly larger relative surface area values for those teeth used in seed processing than closely related taxa that consume resistant foods less often (Cebus albifrons and Pithecia pithecia). Additionally, relative molar-root surface area appears to be greater in Pithecia than in Chiropotes, as predicted from the more folivorous diet of Pithecia. Tooth-root surface area was also found to vary along the tooth row and should therefore have a significant influence on antero-posterior bite-force gradients. The results of this study suggest a close relationship between tooth-root form and patterns of occlusal loading. Further elucidation of this relationship could improve our inferences of diet in extinct taxa, and augment research into the mechanics and evolution of feeding. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cebus; Chiropotes; Dental anatomy; Dietary evolution; Jaw biomechanics; Mastication; Pithecia","animal tissue; article; canine tooth; Cebidae; cebus apella; chiropotes satanas; controlled study; diet; feeding; female; male; molar tooth; nonhuman; pithecia pithecia; plant seed; primate; tooth root; Animals; Biomechanics; Cebidae; Diet; Evolution; Seeds; Species Specificity; Tooth Root",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344464780

Thus, there is potential for fossil taxa, particularly fossil hominins, to be distinguished at similar taxonomic levels using molar crown morphology. Unfortunately, due to occlusal attrition, the original crown morphology is often absent in fossil teeth, and this has limited the amount of shape information used to discriminate hominin molars. The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) of molar teeth preserves considerable shape information, particularly in regard to the original shape of the crown, and remains present through the early stages of attrition. In this study, we investigate whether the shape of the EDJ of lower first and second molars can distinguish species and subspecies of extant Pan. Micro-computed tomography was employed to nondestructively image the EDJ, and geometric morphometric analytical methods were used to compare EDJ shape among samples of Pan paniscus (N = 17), Pan troglodytes troglodytes (N = 13), and Pan troglodytes verus (N = 18). Discriminant analysis indicates that EDJ morphology distinguishes among extant Pan species and subspecies with a high degree of reliability. The morphological differences in EDJ shape among the taxa are subtle and relate to the relative height and position of the dentine horns, the height of the dentine crown, and the shape of the crown base, but their existence supports the inclusion of EDJ shape (particularly those aspects of shape in the vertical dimension) in the systematic analysis of fossil hominin lower molars. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Micro-computed tomography; Sliding semilandmarks; Tooth morphology","article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; dentin; discriminant analysis; enamel; micro-computed tomography; molar tooth; morphometrics; nonhuman; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; subspecies; tooth crown; Animals; Classification; Dental Enamel; Dentin; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Molar; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Principal Component Analysis; Species Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Pan; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Pan troglodytes troglodytes; Pan troglodytes verus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349089351

We surveyed 20 guenons (tribe Cercopithecini) and 4 outgroup taxa for two Y-chromosomal genes, TSPY (∼2240 bp) and SRY (∼780 bp), and one X-chromosomal intergenic region (∼1600 bp) homologous to a fragment of human Xq13.3. Parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of the sex chromosomal datasets consistently cluster the three terrestrial taxa, Cercopithecus aethiops, Cercopithecus Ihoesti, and Erythrocebus patas, into a group that is reciprocally monophyletic with a clade of arboreal Cercopithecus spp. Given that the common ancestor of the two clades was most likely an arboreal taxon, this phylogenetic pattern suggests the transition to terrestriality occurred only once among the extant guenons. This pattern also indicates that the genus Cercopithecus is paraphyletic, as presently defined, and calls for taxonomic revision so that the nomen describes a strictly monophyletic group. We outline four acceptable taxonomic schemes and suggest that the most appropriate is to reassign C. aethiops, C. Ihoesti, and E. patas to the resurrected genus Chlorocebus.

Recently, Greenfield and Washburn (Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 84:17–34, 1991) proposed that there are two types of male canines which reflect different allometric scaling patterns of canine crown height against canine occlusal dimensions. They also suggest that proportional canine shape, measured as canine crown height (or projection) relative to the occlusal dimensions, provides an estimate of the canine's function as a weapon, though they provide no test of this hypothesis. This analysis critically examines the claim that there are two types of male canines among anthropoids. It then tests the hypothesis that relative male canine size (measured against body weight) and proportional canine shape are related to estimates of intermale competition, diet, and substrate (used as a surrogate measure of predation pressure). While there is strong taxonomic variation in canine size and shape among male anthropoids, no evidence is found for two discrete canine types. Rather, within families and subfamilies, canine dimensions scale isometrically against body weight and against each other, with a continuum of canine shapes among different taxa. While variation in male canine size is associated with intermale competition and substrate, even when taxonomic variation is controlled, variation in proportional canine shape is not.

The 15 million-year-old fossils are attributed to a single paleospecies Victoriapithecus macinnesi. Criteria previously used to separate the 59 Victoriapithecus teeth known from Maboko before 1973 into two species, one with colobine and the other with cercopithecine affinities, are shown to be invalid. V. macinnesi differs from extant cercopithecoids in having M1-M3 cristae obliquae and M1/M2 hypoconulids that are differentially expressed across the molar row, being more common on mesial than distal teeth. The species is similar to extant Macaca in having a high degree of M3 size variation that may be related to sexual dimorphism. In contrast, I1-M2 size variation is similar to that observed for most extant cercopithecoid species. Phylogenetic comparison of Victoriapithecus and Prohylobates indicates that although the two genera are distinct, they share a unique combination of primitive catarrhine and derived cercopithecoid dental traits. Colobinae and Cercopithecinae share at least three and probably five traits that are derived relative to the Miocene cercopithecoids. It is concluded that the Miocene and more recent Old World monkeys represent mutual sister-groups with Prohylobates and Victoriapithecus belonging to the family Victoriapithecidae and Colobinae and Cercopithecinae to the family Cercopithecidae. © 1993 Academic Press.

Once distributed throughout North Africa, M. sylvanus is now restricted to isolated forest fragments in Algeria and Morocco. The species is threatened; the maximum total wild population size is estimated at 10,000 individuals. Relationships among surviving wild subpopulations in Algeria (96 samples) and Morocco (116 samples) were examined by using 468-bp sequences from hypervariable region I of the mitochondrial DNA control region. Twenty-four different haplotypes were identified, differing by 1-26 mutational steps (0.2-5.6%) and 1 insertion. With one exception (attributable to secondary introduction in coastal Morocco), Algerian and Moroccan haplotypes are clearly distinct. However, whereas Moroccan subpopulations show little divergence in hypervariable region I sequences and little correspondence with geographical distribution, there is a deep division between two main subpopulations in Algeria and one marked secondary division, with haplotypes generally matching geographical distribution. Accepting an origin of the genus Macaca of 5.5 million years ago, the Moroccan population and the two main Algerian subpopulations diverged ≈1.6 million years ago. Distinction between Moroccan and Algerian haplotypes permitted analysis of the origin of the Gibraltar colony of Barbary macaques (68 samples; 30% of the population). It is generally held that the present Gibraltar population descended from a dozen individuals imported during World War II. However, the Gibraltar sample was found to include Algerian and Moroccan haplotypes separated by at least 16 mutational steps, revealing a dual origin of the founding females. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Conservation; Fragmentation; Haplotype network; Molecular clock; mtDNA","mitochondrial DNA; article; gene sequence; geographic distribution; Gibraltar; haplotype; Macaca; mutation; nonhuman; phylogeny; phylogeography; population genetics; priority journal; Algeria; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Base Sequence; Bayes Theorem; Demography; DNA Primers; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution, Molecular; Genetics, Population; Geography; Gibraltar; Haplotypes; Likelihood Functions; Macaca; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Morocco; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Macaca sylvanus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-18844362880

The reliability of classification of individual specimens into known groups based on their molars varied from 75 to 100%, depending on group and method used. Including 13 sliding semilandmarks to the analysis improved the detection of different kinds of size and shape variation as well as visualization of shape differences between studied groups. Correlation between phylogenetic and morphometric distances suggested about 80% contribution of phylogenetic inertia to the molar shape variation; moreover, the importance of localized versus global shape changes was similar in the detection of phylogenetic signals. Finally, shape changes along individual evolutionary lineages were revealed, suggesting a few cases of reversals, convergence and/or retention of ancestral shape. The evolution of mouse molars has thus been driven by random effects of drift together with stabilizing selection and convergence. © 2006 The Zoological Society of London.","Geometric morphometrics; Mus; Phenotypic evolution; Phylogeny; Thin-plate spline","classification; convergent evolution; morphometry; phenotype; phylogenetics; phylogeny; rodent; shape; tooth; Muridae; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750973039

This is the case despite the fact that dental morphology, which is commonly used to differentiate fossil species, is rarely used to differentiate extant species. Aspects of external morphology, ecology, behavior, breeding patterns, and molecular structure that are used to delineate living species are generally not available for fossils. In this paper, the utility of dental evidence for sorting fossil samples into species is evaluated by testing whether molar occlusal morphology is capable of sorting populations of Pan into the species and subspecies already well-established by nondental evidence. The dentitions of 341 chimpanzee individuals, sampled from regions throughout equatorial Africa, were sorted into 16 populations using rivers to demarcate the boundaries between populations. Digital-imaging software was used to measure 15 traits on the occlusal surface of each upper molar and 19 on each lower molar. After applying size adjustments, size-transformed and untransformed variables were subjected to discriminant analysis, with separate analyses carried out for each molar type. Results indicate that populations of Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus are well differentiated at all molar positions. Populations of P. t. verus are distinct from other populations of P. troglodytes. Populations of P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii show close dental similarity. A distinct population is recognized at the Nigeria-Cameroon border, indicating the presence of P. t. vellerosus. The concordance between the patterns of diversity recognized by this study and other molecular and nonmolecular studies indicates that paleontological species that are similar to species of Pan in terms of size and patterns of diversification may be differentiated using molar morphology. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to the primary cusps, crown surface complexity derives from the presence of crests, cuspules, and crenulations. Developmentally, this complexity results from the deposition of an enamel cap over a basement membrane (the morphology of which is preserved as the enamel-dentine junction, or EDJ, in fully formed teeth). However, the relative contribution of the enamel cap and the EDJ to molar crown complexity is poorly characterized. In this study we examine the complexity of the EDJ and enamel surface of a broad sample of primate (including fossil hominin) lower molars through the application of microcomputed tomography and dental topographic analysis. Surface complexity of the EDJ and outer enamel surface (OES) is quantified by first mapping, and then summing, the total number of discrete surface orientation patches. We investigate the relative contribution of the EDJ and enamel cap to crown complexity by assessing the correlation in patch counts between the EDJ and OES within taxa and within individual teeth. We identify three patterns of EDJ/OES complexity which demonstrate that both crown patterning early in development and the subsequent deposition of the enamel cap contribute to overall crown complexity in primates.

Although analyses to date have been limited mainly to the M2s of a few primate taxa, these suggest that dental topographic analysis holds considerable promise. Still, larger samples including a greater range of species and different tooth types are needed to determine the potential of this approach. Here we examine dental topography of molar teeth of Cercocebus torquatus (n=48), Cercopithecus campbelli (n=50), Colobus polykomos (n=50), and Procolobus badius (n=50). This is the first such study of large samples of Old World monkeys, and the first to include analyses of both M 1s and M 2s. Average slope, relief, and surface angularity were computed and compared among tooth types, wear stages, and species. Results suggest that (1) data for M 1s and M 2s cannot be compared directly; (2) slope and relief decline with wear on M 2s of all taxa, and M 1s of the colobines, whereas angularity does not generally change except in the most worn specimens; and (3) folivorous colobines tend to have more sloping surfaces and more relief than do frugivorous cercopithecines, though angularity does not clearly separate taxa by diet.

An alternative approach involves measurements at the level of the cervical line. We compare the information content of the two options in a three-dimensional (3D) digital sample of lower and upper first molars (M 1 and M1) of modern human and Neanderthal teeth. The cervical outline for each tooth was created by digitizing the cervical line and then sectioning the tooth with a best fit plane. The crown outline was projected onto this same plane. The curves were analyzed by direct extraction of diameters, diagonals, and area and also by principal component analysis either of the residuals obtained by regressing out these measurements from the radii (shape information) or directly by the radii (size and shape information). For M1, the crown and cervical outline radii allow us to discriminate between Neanderthals and modern humans with 90% and 95% accuracy, respectively. Fairly good discrimination between the groups (80-82.5%) was also obtained using cervical measurements. With respect to M1, general overlap of the two groups was obtained by both crown and cervical measurements; however, the two taxa were differentiable by crown outline residuals (90-97%).

Here, I quantitatively estimated the existing variability in size and shape of the Didelphidae scapula (1076 specimens from 56 species) using geometric morphometrics, and compared size and shape differences to evolutionary and ecologic distances. I found considerable variation in the scapula morphology, most of it related to size differences between species. This results in morphologic divergence between different locomotor habits in larger species (resulting from increased mechanical loads), but most smaller species present similarly shaped scapulae. The only exceptions are the water opossum and the short-tailed opossums, and the functional explanations for these differences remain unclear. Scapula size and shape were mapped onto a molecular phylogeny for 32 selected taxa and ancestral size and shapes were reconstructed using squared-changed parsimony. Results indicate that the Didelphidae evolved from a medium- to small-sized ancestor with a generalized scapula, slightly more similar to arboreal ones, but strikingly different from big-bodied present arboreal species, suggesting that the ancestral Didelphidae was a small scansorial animal with no particular adaptations for arboreal or terrestrial habits, and these specializations evolved only in larger-bodied clades. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Locomotion; Marsupials; Morphological evolution; Shoulder girdle","anatomy; body size; bone; locomotion; marsupial; morphology; morphometry; phylogenetics; specialization; animal; article; classification; ecology; evolution; female; genetic variability; genetics; histology; locomotion; male; multivariate analysis; opossum; phylogeny; scapula; Animals; Ecology; Evolution; Female; Genetic Variation; Locomotion; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Opossums; Phylogeny; Scapula; Animalia; Chironectes minimus; Didelphidae; Didelphimorphia; Metatheria; Monodelphis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249189547

They demonstrate the power of combining functional morphology, behavior, and phylogenetic thinking as an approach toward reconstructing the evolutionary history of platyrrhine primates. While contributing new findings pertaining to all the major clades and ecological guilds, these articles reinforce the view that platyrrhines are a coherent ecophylogenetic array that differentiated along niche dimensions definable principally by body size, positional behavior, and feeding strategies. In underlining the value of character analysis and derived morphological and behavioral patterns as tools for deciphering phylogenetic and adaptational history, doubts are raised about a competing small-bore morphological method, parsimony-based cladistic studies.

Extant models are the principal basis for understanding dental variation in the fossil record. As the sister taxon to the hominin clade, Pan is one such model and the only widely accepted extant hominid model for both interspecific and intraspecific variation. To explore the contributions of allometric scaling and meristic variation to molar variation in Pan, we applied geometric shape analysis to 3D landmarks collected from virtual replicas of chimpanzee and bonobo mandibular molars. Multivariate statistical analysis and 3D visualization of metameric and allometric shape vectors were used to characterize shape differences and test the hypothesis that species of Pan share patterns of metameric variation and molar shape allometry. Procrustes-based shape variables were found to effectively characterize crown shape, sorting molars into species and tooth-row positions with ≥95% accuracy. Chimpanzees and bonobos share a common pattern of M 1-M 2 metameric variation, which is defined by differences in the relative position of the metaconid, size of the hypoconulid, curvature of the buccal wall, and proportions of the basins and foveae. Allometric scaling of molar shape is homogeneous for M 1 and M 2 within species, but bonobo and chimpanzee allometric vectors are significantly different. Nevertheless, the common allometric shape trend explains most molar-shape differences between P. paniscus and P. troglodytes. When allometric effects are factored out, chimpanzee and bonobo molars are not morphometrically distinguishable.

However, this observation obfuscates interesting differences among genera of Southeast Asian colobines in morphology and behavior that may be reflected in the degree to which they rely on mastication or gut volume and gut retention time when ingesting and digesting leaves. We detail the use of a laboratory-based method to measure the mechanical properties of foods selected and processed by 4 captive species of Southeast Asian Colobinae -Pygathrix nemaeus, Pygathrix cinerea, Trachypithecus delacouri, and Trachypithecus laotum hatinhensis- at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center (EPRC), Vietnam. We also detail a field method that quantifies chewing rates and chewing behavior via a consumer-grade video camera and laptop computer. Observations in the captive setting permit a degree of experimental control that is not possible in the wild, and the location of the EPRC in the primates' habitat country permitted us to provide leaves that they encounter and eat in the wild. We collected toughness data with a portable tester designed by Lucas et al. The average toughness of selected leaves does not differ among the taxa, nor does the length of time spent chewing foods. However, there are differences in feeding rate, with Trachypithecus spp. chewing foods twice as fast as Pygathrix spp. Our findings suggest that Trachypithecus spp. emphasize comminution of food by mastication, while Pygathrix spp. emphasize the comminution of leaf matter in the stomach. The hypothesis is supported by data on molar size, gut mass, and gut morphology. We provide new insights into dietary variation among primate species and detail methods that are typically conducted only in a laboratory setting.

Nevertheless, and despite continuous improvements to this methodology, the inclusion of novel features in these studies presents some difficulties. In the present study, different methods to explicitly include novel traits in geometric morphometric analyses are compared, including homology-free approaches, landmark-based approaches, and combinations of both techniques. The two-dimensional occlusal morphology of the lower second molar in multiple hominin species was chosen to evaluate these methods, as an example of an anatomical structure including one novelty: a distal fifth cusp is present in earlier hominins, and notably absent in many later Homo species. Results reveal that different approaches provide different results, highlighting that the design of the conformations of landmarks has a high impact on the inferred conclusions. Among diverse methods, a combined approach including landmarks, sliding semilandmarks, and only one landmark related to the studied novelty (an indicator of its absence or presence and of its size, when present), was able to directly discern structures with and without the novel feature, circumventing some of the methodological difficulties associated with these traits. This study demonstrates the ability of geometric morphometric techniques to investigate evolutionary novelties and explores the implications of different methods, providing a reference context for future studies. © 2011 The Author(s).

We examine how well the morphology and behavior of Alouatta and Brachyteles conform to leaf-eating adaptational models derived from other studies. Both genera match these expectations unevenly, which suggests a broader conception of primate folivory is in order. Hence the notion of ""semifolivory."" While their dentitions prove highly sensitive to selection for leaf-eating, core features relating to body size, brain size, ranging behavior and presumed energy budgets are less predictable corollaries. Leaf-eating in atelines and colobines may have evolved from a preadaptive reliance on seed-eating, which would have necessitated comparable gastric adaptations. Fossils suggest semifolivory in the low-energy Howler lineage may have begun with an increase in body size, a relatively small brain and, possibly, a concomitantly enlarged gut, followed by dental adaptations. It may have advanced via body-size reduction, part of a pioneering adaptation in marginal ecologies on the periphery of rich Amazonian habitats or as a strategy to minimize competition among an abundance of frugivores within the lowland forest-perhaps not as a fallback scheme. In the high-energy Muriqui, semifolivory may have evolved in more intensely seasonal, low-yield forests where frugivores were constrained and rare, a model more consistent with the fallback paradigm. The seed-to-leaves evolutionary pathway hypothesized for anthropoid leaf-eaters may be a widespread phenomenon in primates. We propose it is ultimately rooted in a pre-euprimate reliance on the seeds and seed coats of primitive angiosperms before the latter evolved attractive sugary fruits to coax primates into becoming dispersers of seeds, instead consumers. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Alouatta; Brachyteles; Dietary adaptation; Folivory; Howler monkeys; Muriqui; Platyrrhines; Primate origins","Alouatta; Alouatta beizebul; Alouatta caraya; Alouatta fusca; Alouatta pallieta; Alouatta pigra; Alouatta seniculus; article; Ateles beizebuth; Ateles geoffroyi; Ateles paniscus; behavior; body size; Brachyteles; Brachyteles arachnoides; brain size; dentition; energy balance; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; feeding behavior; folivory; food preference; frugivore; habitat; herbivore; Lagothrix lagotricha; morphology; nonhuman; plant leaf; Platyrrhini; priority journal; seasonal variation; Animals; Biological Evolution; Cebidae; Eating; Herbivory; Plant Leaves; Alouatta; Brachyteles; Brachyteles arachnoides; Magnoliophyta; Platyrrhini; Primates; Simiiformes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-81255207549

However, recent ecological studies have revealed that extensive seed eating is found in some colobine species. The ripeness of foraged seeds is also reported to differ between seed eaters. As seeds are generally stress-limited and may pose greater mechanical demands, seed-eating species are predicted to exhibit morphological features adaptive for seed predation. In addition, species that feeds on seeds from unripe fruits with hard pericarp is predicted to exhibit increased leverage for anterior dentition. To test these hypotheses, we compared the craniodental morphology of seed-eating Asian colobines (Presbytis rubicunda and Trachypithecus phayrei) with those of species that rarely exploit seeds (Presbytis comata, Trachypithecus obscurus, and Semnopithecus vetulus). The results show that the seed-eating colobines possess a masticatory system with enhanced leverage at postcanine bite points. The sclerocarpic forager P. rubicunda also exhibits markedly greater masticatory leverage at anterior dental bite points, while the mature-seed-eating T. phayrei shows no such advantage for canine and incisor use. These observations suggest that P. rubicunda is well adapted to husking the resistant pericarps of unripe fruits, using the anterior dentition and to gain access to the immature seeds, whereas such sclerocarpic feeding behavior may be less important for T. phayrei. Our findings indicate that the distinctive craniodental variations of colobines may be linked to mature and/or immature seed eating and suggest the significance of seed predation for the evolution of colobine monkeys.

Here, molar shape and function are investigated through traditional multivariate statistics and Thin-Plate Splines deformations to compare the relative location of lower first molar occlusal structures (protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, entoconid, cristid obliqua, and protolophid) in modern lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, and a non-primate outgroup taxon (Tupaia). Results suggest that shape is based both on tooth size and dietary patterns. Small teeth tend to be short (anteroposteriorally) with wide talonids, whereas larger teeth are generally characterized as being long and narrow. In considering non-size related shape trends, frugivorous and graminivorous taxa generally exhibit a relatively buccal intersection of the cristid obliqua with the base of the protolophid, and a relatively ""perpendicular"" position of the protolophid in relation to the anteroposterior axis of the tooth (defined as the axis connecting the protolophid and hypoconid). Morphological trends of folivores include a central (midline) position of the cristid obliqua-protolophid base intersection and an oblique angle of the protolophid. Insectivorous taxa (primate and non-primate) generally exhibit a central placement of the cristid obliqua-protolophid base intersection (as in folivores), along with a relatively perpendicular angle of the protolophid (as in frugivores). Omnivorous taxa exhibit shape patterns that are intermediate between these three former groups.

With regard to adaptation, many have argued that adaptive characters are poorly suited to phylogenetic analysis because of a propensity for homoplasy, while others have argued that complex adaptive characters should be given high weight because homoplasy in complex characters is unlikely. Similarly, with regard to correlated sets of characters, one point of view is that such sets should be collapsed into a single character-a single piece of phylogenetic evidence. Another point of view is that a suite of correlated characters should be emphasized in phylogenetics, again because recurrence of detailed similarity in the same suite of features is unlikely. In this paper, I discuss the theoretical background of adaptation and functional integration with respect to phylogenetic systematics of primates. Several character examples are reviewed with regard to their functional morphology and phylogenetic signal: postorbital structures, tympanic morphology, fusion of the mandibular symphysis, the tooth comb, strepsirrhine talar morphology, and the prehensile tail. It is clear when considering characters such as these that some characters are synapomorphic of major clades and at the same time functionally important. This appears particularly to be the case when characters are integrated into a complex and maintained as stable configurations. Rather than being simply a problem in character analysis, processes of integration may help to explain the utility of phylogenetically informative characters. On the other hand, the character examples also highlight the difficulty in forming a priori predictions about a character's phylogenetic signal. Explanations of patterns of character evolution are often clade-specific, which does not allow for a simple framework of character selection and/or weighting. © 2007.","Character weighting; Functional complex; Homology; Homoplasy","adaptation; functional morphology; homology; phylogenetics; primate; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247618666

Their morphology is intermediate between that of hominoids and cercopithecids. Unlike colobine and cercopithecine milk teeth, Victoriapithecus dp3s, dp4s, and at least 7 (14%) dp4s lack transverse distal loph(id)s and are not bilophodont. Victoriapithecus also differs from cercopithecids in having less elongated deciduous premolars, a dp3 metacone set mesial to a very small hypocone, a dp4 crista obliqua, and a dp4 hypoconulid. The deciduous canines and incisors of Victoriapithecus are like those of other cercopithecids in having an uneven distribution of enamel around a compressed (rather than cylindrical) root, but differ from cercopithecids and resemble hominoids in being more elongated. Since Colobinae and Cercopithecinae share features of the deciduous dentition that are derived relative to Victoriapithecus and hominoids, extant Old World monkeys are interpreted as representing the sister‐taxon of the middle Miocene cercopithecoids. Due to a dramatic increase in the number of deciduous teeth found at Maboko Island, juvenile individuals represent a much larger proportion of recently excavated Victoriapithecus collections than is true of pre‐1987 assemblages which mainly derive from sediment first excavated during the 1930s and 1940s. Age distribution differences between pre‐ and post‐1987 samples indicate that paleontological collection procedures were more important than taphonomic biases in determining the paleodemographic profile of the Maboko fossils. Since the Victoriapithecus assemblage from Maboko is strikingly similar to that of fossil Theropithecus oswaldi from Olorgesailie in terms of the large number of specimens and high representation of juvenile and infant individuals, the latter can no longer be viewed as unique among cercopithecoid fossil assemblages. Rather than being related to a specific cause of death, such as selective hunting of T. oswaldi by Homo (Shipman et al. [1981] Curr. Anthropol. 22:257–268), the large number of cercopithecoids at both sites is attributed to the fact that both assemblages represent excavated samples and that the preferred habitats of the extinct monkeys were probably at or near the site of deposition. The greater number of young adult male than female canines in the apparently attritional Maboko Bed 5 assemblage, indicate that the social organization of V. macinnesi may have been similar to that of modrn macaques, with males migrating out of their natal group and suffering higher death rates than females at puberty. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

In this study, molar morphometrics were used to evaluate patterns of geographic variation in gorillas. Dental specimens of 323 adult individuals, drawn from the current distribution of gorillas in equatorial Africa were divided into 14 populations. Discriminant analyses and Mahalanobis distances were used to study population structure.Results reveal that: 1) the West and East African gorillas form distinct clusters, 2) the Cross River gorillas are well separated from the rest of the western populations, 3) gorillas from the Virunga mountains and the Bwindi Forest can be differentiated from the lowland gorillas of Utu and Mwenga-Fizi, 4) the Tshiaberimu gorillas are distinct from other eastern gorillas, and the Kahuzi-Biega gorillas are affiliated with them. These findings provide support for a species distinction between Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei, with subspecies G. g. diehli, G. g. gorilla, G. b. graueri, G. b. beringei, and possibly, G. b. rex-pygmaeorum. Clear correspondence between dental and other patterns of taxonomic diversity demonstrates that dental data reveal underlying genetic patterns of differentiation.Dental distances increased predictably with altitude but not with geographic distances, indicating that altitudinal segregation explains gorilla patterns of population divergence better than isolation-by-distance. The phylogeographic pattern of gorilla dental metric variation supports the idea that Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and local mountain building activity in Africa affected gorilla phylogeography. I propose that West Africa comprised the historic center of gorilla distribution and experienced drift-gene flow equilibrium, whereas Nigeria and East Africa were at the periphery, where climatic instability and altitudinal variation promoted drift and genetic differentiation. This understanding of gorilla population structure has implications for gorilla conservation, and for understanding the distribution of sympatric chimpanzees and Plio-Pleistocene hominins. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Altitudinal variation; Chimpanzees; Drift; Gene flow; Gorilla; Hominins; Molar morphometrics; Phylogeography","altitudinal zonation; dentition; discriminant analysis; gene flow; genetic differentiation; genetic drift; geographical distribution; morphometry; paleobiogeography; paleoclimate; phylogeography; Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary; population structure; primate; spatial variation; species diversity; taxonomy; Bwindi Impenetrable National Park; Cross River [(RVR) West Africa]; East Africa; Southern Province [Uganda]; Uganda; Virunga Mountains; West Africa; Gorilla beringei; Gorilla gorilla; Gorilla gorilla gorilla; Pan",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954217964

In this study, dental crown shape of the three early Pleistocene hominin teeth (P3, M1, and M1) found in Jianshi, Hubei Province of China was analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. The comparative samples of fossil hominins from Africa, Asia, and Europe as well as those of modern humans (N = 257) were used. The results indicate that the contour, asymmetry, and cusp patterns of these three types of teeth differ obviously between the fossil hominins and modern humans. The crown shape of P3 in most fossil hominins including Australopithecus, African early Homo, and Asian Pleistocene hominins are asymmetric with their crown occlusal contours long and curving elliptic-shaped. The occlusal contour of the fossil hominin M1 is symmetric and rectangle-shaped with no marked cusp protrusion. The crown shape of fossil M1 is characterized by asymmetric contour with slightly projected metaconid and hypoconid. On the contrary, in modern Chinese and some European late Pleistocene hominins, the crowns of P3s show symmetric contours with buccal side wider than lingual side; the crown shape of M1 is asymmetric with lingual cusp distalplaced, especially for hypoconid; the M1 has symmetric and round crown contour. Our study reveals that Australopithecus has wide variations in its crown shape, whereas these dental morphospaces of Asian hominins are closely placed. The crown contour, symmetry, and cusp patterns of these three teeth of Jianshi hominin resemble those of Asian early and middle Pleistocene hominins. No marked difference in dental crown shape is shown between the Jianshi hominin and other Chinese Homo erectus, and there is also no evidence in support of the Jianshi hominin's closeness to Australopithecus and African early Homo members. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","China; geometric morphometric; Hubei; human evolution; Jianshi; shape; tooth","Crown shape; Dental crowns; East Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Hominins; Homo erectus; Hubei Province; Human evolution; Late Pleistocene; Morphometric analysis; Pleistocene; Geometry; Dentistry; asymmetry; fossil record; geometry; hominid; human evolution; morphology; morphometry; Pleistocene; shape; symmetry; taxonomy; tooth; China; Hubei; Jianshi; Australopithecus; Homo erectus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955306088

The relationship between incisor allometry and diet is well documented for both platyrrhines and catarrhines; however, similar relationships between incisor shape and crown curvature have to date only been reported for living and fossil members of the superfamily Hominoidea. Given the limited taxonomic diversity among the extant members of that group, it is difficult to firmly establish the relative influence of phylogeny and dietary function in the governance of incisor crown curvature. Unlike hominoids, which are represented by only five living genera, extant platyrrhines are a more varied group that includes 16 ecologically diverse genera. In an effort to clarify the functional relationship between maxillary and mandibular incisor crown curvature and diet, this study uses high resolution polynomial curve fitting to quantify mesiodistal and cervicoincisal curvature for a taxonomically diverse platyrrhine sample (n = 133 individuals representing 18 taxa) with well documented dietary behavior. Results were consistent with prior analyses of hominoid incisor curvature and identify a significant and positive correlation between incisor crown curvature and diet such that increasing curvature is associated with a proportionate increase in frugivory. These results are independent confirmation of the results reported from a previous analysis of hominoid incisor curvature and provide new evidence to suggest that diet is the primary governing factor influencing anthropoid incisor curvature.
