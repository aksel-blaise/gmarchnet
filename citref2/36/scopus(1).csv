Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

For this reason, studies focusing on purported early hominid hunting and butchery sites are important if rigorous criteria for recognizing such sites are used. Different criteria currently used as evidence of hominid involvement with ancient bones are reviewed and it is concluded that the presence of cutmarks, verified by scanning electron microscope (SEM) inspection, is the most reliable. Successful application of this criterion depends upon a thorough knowledge of the normal variations in microscopic morphology of different types of marks that are found on bones. Therefore, variations in microscopic and gross morphology within and among a large sample of known stone tool cutmarks, carnivore tooth scratches, and rodent gnawing marks are documented. The effects of sedimentary abrasion, as caused by fluvial transport of bones, are also presented. Guidelines are presented for using microscopic criteria to identify unknown marks on fossils and possible applications of this approach are discussed. Further, it is suggested that evidence of hominid carcass-processing activities can be placed into one of three ranked categories of certainty according to the type of data used. Explicitly stating the category and type of evidence used to deduce hominid activities, and by extension to define site types (i.e., butchery, kill, base camp), may improve the clarity of hypotheses about and interpretations of early hominid behaviors. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002170703

The experimental background applied to differentiate both types of marks has been rather limited and authors have sometimes reached conflicting conclusions. This is partly due to methodological reasons: some authors have used very high magnification to examine microscopic features, whereas others have relied on more reduced magnification. Likewise, some experiments have exposed bones to trampling for reduced periods (minutes) whereas others have used longer time periods (hours). The present study stresses that the use of a scanning electronic microscope is not practical for identifying the impact of butchery and trampling marks in complete bone assemblages. It also emphasizes that previous studies have not addressed all the possible variables that could potentially be used to discriminate these marks, nor have they quantified the morphological patterns of each type of mark. Here we present a multivariate analysis of more than a dozen variables and show that butchery and trampling marks have very distinctive microscopic morphology. We advocate the use of a low magnification approach (≤40×), which can enable the analysis of complete assemblages using either hand lenses or binocular lenses. We also show the morphological criteria that differentiate butchery cut marks made with simple and retouched tools. We show that whereas complete discrimination of marks is impossible due to some degree of overlap, the list of criteria derived through multivariate analyses can be confidently used to correctly differentiate butchery and trampling marks in more than 90% of cases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

These remains were recovered from the Aurora Stratum of Unit TD6. This stratum has a thickness of approximately 30 cm. The area of the exploratory excavation is about 7 m2. According to palaeomagnetic analyses, Unit TD6 shows reversed polarity, which is considered to belong to the Matuyama chron. This unit is immediately below TD7, where the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary has been detected, indicating an age of around 780,000 years BP. There is no specific distribution, treatment, or arrangement of the human remains, which were found randomly mixed with abundant faunal remains and stone tools. Most of the faunal and human fossil bones from the Aurora Stratum have human induced damage. Stone tool cutmarks are frequent, and peeling (a type of fracture similar to bending a fresh twig between the hands) provides a specific breakage pattern together with percussion marks and chopmarks. Both non-human and human remains show similar intensive exploitation. Slight differences, however, have been observed between fauna and humans (e.g., peeling frequent in humans, rare in fauna), that appear related to different musculature, weight, and bone structure. The characteristics of this fossil assemblage suggest that it is solely the result of consumptive activities as there is no evidence of ritual or other intention. The possibility of distinguishing between dietary vs. survival cannibalism is discussed here.

As such, they hold some of the oldest available information on cognitive ability and behaviour in human evolution. Here we present a new method that allows a three-dimensional reconstruction of cutmark morphology and the quantification of profile parameters. We have tested this new technique on cutmarks that were experimentally inflicted on a pig rib using a steel knife and an un-retouched flint flake at different angles. The method allows for the cross-sectional shape, the sharpness and depths of the resulting cutmarks to be quantified. The data show that knife mark sections are characterised by a V-shape or √-shape depending on the inclination of the knife. Cutmarks produced with the flint flake were less clearly defined and generally less sharp than those produced by the knife. We discuss the method's potential to provide new information on butchery technique and cognitive abilities developed by the human lineage, from the earliest tool-using hominins through to modern Homo sapiens. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Morphological attributes of the cut marks were measured using an Alicona imaging microscope, a novel optical technique that generates three-dimensional virtual reconstructions of surface features. The study shows that high-resolution measurements of cut marks can shed light on aspects of butchery techniques, tool use and the behavioural repertoire of Lower Palaeolithic hominins. Differences between the experimental cut marks and those on the Boxgrove large mammal bones suggest variation in the angle of the cuts and greater forces used in the butchery of the larger (rhinoceros-sized) carcasses at Boxgrove. Tool-edge characteristics may account for some of these differences, but the greater robusticity of the Boxgrove hominins (attributed to Homo heidelbergensis) may be a factor in the greater forces indicated by some of the cut marks on the Boxgrove specimens. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The author conducted experiments to establish the relationship between the edge characteristics of metal and stone tools that create slicing cut-marks and the marks they produce when applied to bone. The type of tool used to produce such cut-marks on bone can be identified by taking silicone moulds of slicing cut-marks and analysing them in a scanning electron microscope. Quantifying the distribution of metal versus stone tool types over time and space provides insight into the processes underlying the introduction and diffusion of a functional metallurgical technology for subsistence activities. Prehistoric data from the central Balkans of southeast Europe are presented to illustrate the utility of the procedure. These data are used to calculate the frequency of use and relative importance of stone and metal implements over time in the central Balkans, from the introduction of metallurgy during the Late Neolithic (c. 3900-3300 BC) through the end of the Bronze Age (c. 1000 BC).","Cut-marks; Experimental archaeology; Metallurgy; Scanning electron microscopy; Zooarchaeology","archaeological evidence; bone; metallurgy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033405768

These artefacts, usually between 5 and 10 cm in maximum dimension and weighing between 250 and 1000 g, are characterized by their roughly globular shape and the numerous flake scars on their exterior surface. Previous interpretations of these forms have suggested that they are intentionally shaped tools representative of an evolved ""Pebble Tool"" stage.

This enables the direct observation of their shape from several points of view and the relatively rapid procurement of a variety of measurements (e.g. depth, breadth, angles). This technology has been applied to several butchery experiments, in which both stone and metal tools have been used to produce cut marks on skeletal elements. The morphometrical parameters presented in this paper enabled the correct identification of the different origins of experimental striations and were further tested on two archaeological sets of cut marks inflicted by both metal blades and flint flakes or tools. Therefore, the obtained experimental records constitute a useful database for archaeological remains.

Taphonomic and experimental approaches have been systematically applied in an effort to understand the technical and artistic procedures followed. In this study, we applied a new combination of 3-dimensional microscopy (focus variation optical microscope) and micro-CT scanning to the analysis of two Magdalenian engraved specimens: a reindeer antler from the site of Neschers (France), engraved with the partial image of a horse in left profile, and a horse metatarsal from Courbet Cave, Penne (France), engraved with a horse head also in left profile. Results of the analysis suggest that both the Neschers and Courbet Cave engravings had been prepared before being carved. The overall contours of the horse body/head were incised first, while anatomical features were added afterwards. In the Neschers case, the incision resulted from the repeated scratching of a previously made incision in order to enlarge the engraving, possibly reflecting the engraver's aesthetic sense. The combination of the techniques used in this study is applicable to fragile or unique archaeological specimens. Micro-CT scanning, in particular, provides non-invasive means for identifying engravings that are obscured by encrusted sediment. The application of these techniques can potentially open new avenues for the authentication, technical and gestural recognition and interpretation of incised forms and artistic creativity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Courbet Cave; Engraving; Focus variation microscopy; Magdalenian portable art; Micro-CT; Neschers","archaeological evidence; art; bone; Paleolithic; taphonomy; France; Animalia; Equidae; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874404546

This work focuses on a sample of cut-marked bones from the Bell's Korongo (BK) site (Upper Bed II, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania), which is an emblematic early Pleistocene site where a large faunal assemblage, including a diverse megafauna, occurs in association with quartzite and basalt industries. We present a detailed study of a sample of 58 cut marks identified on a set of recently excavated BK fossils, using a micro-photogrammetric and geometric morphometric approach, with the aim of identifying the raw materials used in the butchery of carcasses. In order to carry out this study, we previously carried out an experimental analysis to characterize cut marks and their morphology according to the types of raw material found at BK, namely quartzite and basalt. The results from the experimental study show that there is a good fit between raw material type and cut mark morphology, enabling us to confidently apply this method to the analysis of the cut marks of the BK fossil assemblage. The present study shows that most of the BK cut marks were created by the use of quartzite tools. The efficiency of this type of raw material is emphasized, which explains its curation over the landscape by hominins. © 2017 Collegium Boreas.

In the present work, the technological study of the new lithic sample is described. The results show the co-occurrence in the same site of different technological behaviors. At FLK N, hominins were involved in both percussion/battering activities and, through freehand and bipolar knapping, in core reduction. However, the reconstruction of the operational sequences shows that core reduction was probably a marginal behavior, while percussion/battering activities occurred more regularly throughout the sequence. If hominins were not involved in regular carcass processing, as recent taphonomic studies suggest, then hominins' sporadic and low-impact visits to the site over a long period of time must have been driven by other activities probably linked to the exploitation of alternative resources. Plant processing could have been a plausible explanation for hominin presence at FLK N. © 2010 University of Washington.","Battering activities; Hominin impact; Knapping activities; Landscape strategies; Operational sequences; Plant resources; Technology; Typology","Battering activities; Hominin impact; Knapping activities; Landscape strategies; Operational sequence; Plant resources; Typology; Stratigraphy; Plants (botany); archaeological evidence; artifact; biostratigraphy; exploitation; fossil assemblage; hominid; lithic fragment; paleontology; reconstruction; resource availability; stratigraphic correlation; taphonomy; tool use; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649326660

Leakey in 1963. Extensive lithic and faunal assemblages were retrieved from several levels of the archaeological site. TK is located at the exposed top of Olduvai's Bed II, recently dated to 1.353 ± 0.035 Ma. From a geo-archaeological perspective, the stratigraphic studies have provided a redefinition of the processes involved in the site's formation.This paper offers a geological interpretation that revises and amends previous ones. The new interpretation focuses particularly on the technological and paleoeconomic study of a new lithic assemblage recovered from the lower occupation level (TKLF). This assemblage comprises 5805 objects in total, including 3812 items of shatter. We analyse here the chaînes opératoires represented in this level, as well as the processes implied by the raw materials, management, maintenance and abandonment of the lithic assemblage.The character of the site, as well as the activities carried out in it, have been greatly influenced by the proximity of the sources of the raw material primarily used, which could have been extracted from an inselberg of a particular type of quartzite located within a few hundred meters of the site. Two different chaînes opératoires can be identified in TKLF: one based on obtaining flakes from varied blanks, particularly volcanic rocks and the distinctive quartzite, and the second on the manufacture of large and highly standardized bifaces that were produced, used and abandoned in the site. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893865608

Indeed, a total of 1828 graffiti have been found. The reading and the recording of the inscriptions are generally dependent on the state of conservation of the graffito and its support. In numerous cases, only a pale shadow of the inscription is visible, which makes traditional observations, such as visual observations with the naked eye, unsuitable for its decipherment. Consequently, advanced techniques have been applied for enhancing the readability of such inscriptions. In our paper we show the efficiency of 3D laser profilometry as well as high resolution photography as powerful means to decipher illegible engraved inscriptions.

These studies have allowed us to obtain important information about human prehistory spanning from the origin of meat consumption for chronologies around 2.5 Ma, the detection of human hunting behavior during the lower Pleistocene, or even to determine the uses of diverse raw materials on carcases. Amongst the different analyses applied to the study of cut marks, there has been an increasing interest in using morphometry in order to differentiate and characterize the raw materials with which the effectors were made. These techniques have proven to be extremely useful. Nevertheless, this 3D methodology demands the use of expensive equipment and does not allow using an extensive sample, making it a complex and problematic technique. Maté-González et al. (2015) considered an alternative technique, by combining different disciplines involving geometric morphometrics, photogrammetry and multivariate statistics (multidisciplinary methodology).
