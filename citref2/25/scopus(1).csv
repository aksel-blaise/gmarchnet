As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

The accuracy of linear measurements of enamel thickness and cortical bone thickness taken from CT scans is evaluated by making comparison with measurements taken directly from physical sections. The measurements of cortical bone are taken on extant and fossil specimens with and without attached matrix, and the dental specimens studied include a sample of 12 extant human molars. Local CT numbers (representing X‐ray, attenuation) are used to determine the exact position of the boundaries of a structure. Using this technique most studied dimensions, including four of human molar enamel thickness, could be obtained from CT scans with a maximum error range of ±0.1 mm. The limitations of the method are discussed with special reference to problems associated with highly mineralized fossils. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Although common-place in engineering and orthopedic science for more than 30 years, only recently has it begun to be adopted in the zoological and paleontological sciences to address questions of organismal morphology, function, and evolution. Current research tends to focus on either deductive studies that assume a close relationship between form and function or inductive studies that aim to test this relationship, although explicit hypothesis-testing bridges these two standpoints. Validation studies have shown congruence between in vivo or in vitro strain and FE-inferred strain. Future validation work on a broad range of taxa will assist in phylogenetically bracketing our extinct animal FE-models to increase confidence in our input parameters, although currently, FEA has much potential in addressing questions of form-function relationships, providing appropriate questions are asked of the existing data.

Four finite-element analyses were performed in which the model was assigned different sets of elastic properties. In analysis 1, elastic properties were modeled isotropically using published data obtained from human limb bones. Analyses 2-4 used data obtained from skulls of a closely allied species, M. mulatta, but varied as to how those data were incorporated into the model. In analysis 2, the model was assigned a single set of isotropic elastic properties. In analysis 3, each region within the model was assigned its own set of isotropic elastic properties. Finally, in analysis 4, each region received its own set of orthotropic elastic properties. Although a qualitative assessment indicates that the locations of strain concentrations across the model are broadly similar in all analyses, a quantitative assessment of strain indicates some differences between the analyses. When strain data from the finite-element analyses were compared to strain data derived from in vivo experiments, it was found that the model deformed most realistically using the orthotropic elastic properties employed in analysis 4. Results suggest that finite-element analyses can be adversely affected when elastic properties are modeled imprecisely, and that modelers should attempt to obtain elastic properties data about the species and skeletal elements that are the subjects of their analyses. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Elastic properties; Finite-element analysis; Mastication","accuracy; conference paper; elasticity; finite element analysis; human; in vivo study; limb; Macaca; mastication; mathematical model; nonhuman; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; skull; species difference; Anatomy; Animals; Body Patterning; Elasticity; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Macaca fascicularis; Macaca mulatta; Male; Masseter Muscle; Mastication; Models, Biological; Pterygoid Muscles; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Weight-Bearing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-16444362747

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

FEA is rarely applied to problems of biomechanical design in animals, despite its potential to inform structure-function analysis. Non-invasive techniques such as computed tomography scans can be used to generate accurate three-dimensional images of structures, such as skulls, which can form the basis of an accurate finite element model. Here we have applied this technique to the long skull of the large carnivorous theropod dinosaur Allosaurus fragilis5.

Smith, A.L., Department of Anthropology, University at Albany, 1400 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12222, United States","The African Plio-Pleistocene hominins known as australopiths evolved a distinctive craniofacial morphology that traditionally has been viewed as a dietary adaptation for feeding on either small, hard objects or on large volumes of food. A historically influential interpretation of this morphology hypothesizes that loads applied to the premolars during feeding had a profound influence on the evolution of australopith craniofacial form. Here, we test this hypothesis using finite element analysis in conjunction with comparative, imaging, and experimental methods. We find that the facial skeleton of the Australopithecus type species, A. africanus, is well suited to withstand premolar loads. However, we suggest that the mastication of either small objects or large volumes of food is unlikely to fully explain the evolution of facial form in this species. Rather, key aspects of australopith craniofacial morphology are more likely to be related to the ingestion and initial preparation of large, mechanically protected food objects like large nuts and seeds. These foods may have broadened the diet of these hominins, possibly by being critical resources that australopiths relied on during periods when their preferred dietary items were in short supply. Our analysis reconciles apparent discrepancies between dietary reconstructions based on biomechanics, tooth morphology, and dental microwear. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Diet; Evolution; Face; Finite element analysis; Hominin","article; Australopithecus africanus; biomechanics; craniofacial morphology; finite element analysis; hominid; human; mastication; Pleistocene; priority journal; skeleton; Animals; Biomechanics; Diet; Ecology; Evolution; Feeding Behavior; Finite Element Analysis; Fossils; Hominidae; Macaca; Models, Theoretical; Muscles; Paleontology; Software; Australopithecus; Australopithecus africanus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-60549109629

This was done by measuring and analyzing patterns of in vivo bone strain recorded from three‐element rosette strain gages bonded to the supraorbital region and to other portions of the bony face of Macaca fascicularis and Papio anubis during mastication and incision. The magnitude and direction of the principal strains recorded support Endo's hypothesis that the supraorbital region during mastication and incision is bent in the frontal plane (Endo, 1966). Our data do not, however, support his hypothesis that the supraorbital region is bent more during incision than during mastication. The data also demonstrate that overall levels of supraorbital strain are not larger in more prognathic subjects. Most importantly, the data indicate that the supraorbital region of nonhuman catarrhines is strained very little during mastication and incision. This indicates that there is much more supraorbital bone than is necessary both to counter masticatory loads and to provide an adequate safety factor to failure for these loads. This in turn suggests that the macaque and baboon browridges can be considerably reduced in size and still maintain these required structural characteristics. Thus, our experiments provide no support whatsoever for those hypotheses that directly link browridge morphology to masticatory stress (cf. Endo, 1966; Russell, 1983, 1985). A recent review of Endo's original work indicates that this latter statement is also true for humans (Picq and Hylander, 1989). We conclude, therefore, that there is no good reason to believe that enlarged browridges in living and/or fossil primates are structural adaptations to counter intense masticatory forces. The evolution of browridge morphology in primates is best explained on the basis of factors related to the position of the brain relative to the orbits (Moss and Young, 1960). When these structures are widely separated, as in gorillas, the large intervening space must be bridged with bone. In addition, enough bone must be present within the supraorbital and bridged regions to prevent structural failure due to non‐masticatory external forces associated with highly active primates (e.g., accidental traumatic forces applied to the orbits and neurocranium). This requirement results in both pronounced browridges and in much more supraorbital bone than is necessary to counter routine cyclical stress during mastication and incision. This in turn explains why bone strains recorded from the supraorbital region are extremely small relative to other portions of the primate face during mastication and incision.

Estimates of bite force based on these measurements were calculated for the hominid fossils and for extant hominoid species. Relative to known or estimated body weight, only the robust australopithecines proved capable of generating bite forces that are exceptionally high compared to those characterizing living species. Forces developed by gracile australopithecines and early Homo resemble those of chimpanzees. When bite force is plotted against the occlusal area of the molar teeth, neither robust nor gracile forms deviate substantially from the regression line based on living hominoid species. We suggest that the high bite force of the robust australopithecines was a necessary consequence of the enlargement of molar crown surface. Bite force reduction is a late trend in hominid evolution that parallels a reduction in tooth size. Some of the characteristics of early hominid skull shape can be interpreted as adaptations to augment bite force with increasing tooth size. © 1988.","Bite force; cranium; fossil hominids; functional morphology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249027294

The triangular shape that the ""sagittally"" oriented infraorbital plate assumes is considered the result of its greater efficiency in opposing the rotation of the anterior part of the face.

We have therefore developed finite element models of two crania of Macaca fascicularis and investigated their sensitivity to variations in bone material properties, the zygomatico-temporal suture and the loading regimen applied to the zygomatic arch. Maximum principal strains were validated against data derived from ex vivo strain gauge experiments using non-physiological loads applied to the macaque zygomatic arch. Elastic properties of the zygomatic arch bone and the zygomatico-temporal suture obtained by nanoindentation resulted in a high degree of congruence between experimental and simulated strains. The findings also indicated that the presence of a zygomatico-temporal suture in the model produced strains more similar to experimental values than a completely separated or fused arch. Strains were distinctly higher when the load was applied through the modelled superficial masseter compared with loading an array of nodes on the arch. This study demonstrates the importance of the accurate selection of the material properties involved in predicting strains in a finite element model. Furthermore, our findings strongly highlight the influence of the presence of craniofacial sutures on strains experienced in the face. This has implications when investigating craniofacial growth and masticatory function but should generally be taken into account in functional analyses of the craniofacial system of both extant and extinct species. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Cranial sutures; Elastic properties; Experimentals train analysis; Finite element analysis; Primates; Sensitivity; Skull; Validation","animal tissue; article; controlled study; cranial suture; craniofacial development; elasticity; finite element analysis; functional assessment; Macaca; male; mastication; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; simulation; skeleton; species difference; strain gauge transducer; temporal bone; validation study; weight bearing; zygoma; Animals; Biomechanics; Computer Simulation; Elasticity; Finite Element Analysis; Macaca; Male; Models, Biological; Reproducibility of Results; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Zygoma; Crania; Macaca; Macaca fascicularis; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845965343

This septum, formed by the frontal, alisphenoid, and zygomatic bones, separates the orbital contents from the temporal muscles. Three hypotheses suggest that the postorbital septum evolved to resist stresses acting on the skull during mastication or incision. The facial- torsion hypothesis posits that the septum resists twisting of the face about a rostrocaudal axis during unilateral mastication; the transverse-bending hypothesis argues that the septum resists caudally directed forces acting at the lateral orbital margin during mastication or incision; and the tension hypothesis suggests that the septum resists ventrally directed components of masseter muscle force during mastication and incision. This study evaluates these hypotheses using in vitro and in vivo bone strain data recorded from the circumorbital region of owl monkeys. Incisor loading of an owl monkey skull in vitro bends the face upward in the sagittal plane, compressing the interorbital region rostrocaudally and 'buckling' the lateral orbital walls. Unilateral loading of the toothrow in vitro also bends the face in the sagittal plane, compressing the interorbital region rostrocaudally and buckling the working side lateral orbital wall. When the lateral orbital wall is partially cut, so as to reduce the width of its attachment to the braincase, the following changes in circumorbital bone strain patterns occur. During loading of the incisors, lower bone strain magnitudes are recorded in the interorbital region and lateral orbital walls. In contrast, during unilateral loading of the P3, higher bone strain magnitudes are observed in the interorbital region, and generally lower bone strain magnitudes are observed in the lateral orbital walls. During unilateral loading of the M2, higher bone strain magnitudes are observed in both the interorbital region and in the lateral orbital wall ipsilateral to the loaded molar. Comparisons of the in vitro results with data gathered in vivo suggest that, during incision and unilateral mastication, the face is subjected to upward bending in the sagittal plane resulting in rostrocaudal compression of the interorbital region. Modeling the lateral orbital walls as curved plates suggests that during mastication the working side wall is buckled due to the dorsally directed component of the maxillary bite force which causes upward bending of the face in the sagittal plane. The balancing side lateral orbital wall may also be buckled due to upward bending of the face in the sagittal plane as well as being twisted by the caudoventrally directed components of the superficial masseter muscle force. The in vivo data do not exclude the possibility that the postorbital septum functions to improve the structural integrity of the postorbital bar during mastication. However, there is no reason to believe that a more robust postorbital bar could not also perform this function. Hypotheses stating that the postorbital septum originally evolved to reinforce the skull against routine masticatory loads must explain why, rather than evolving a postorbital septum, the stem anthropoids did not simply enlarge their postorbital bars.","Anthropoid origins; Evolutionary morphology; Lateral orbital wall; Mastication","anthropoidea; anthropology; article; masseter muscle; mastication; orbit; Animals; Aotidae; Female; Male; Mastication; Models, Anatomic; Orbit; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029764403

This conclusion has various implications with regard to the evolution of human feeding behaviour. However, human dental anatomy suggests a capacity to withstand high loads and two-dimensional lever models greatly simplify muscle architecture, yielding less accurate results than three- dimensional modelling using multiple lines of action. Here, to our knowledge, in the most comprehensive three-dimensional finite element analysis performed to date for any taxon, we ask whether the traditional view that the bite of H. sapiens is weak and the skull too gracile to sustain high bite forces is supported. We further introduce a new method for reconstructing incomplete fossil material. Our findings show that the human masticatory apparatus is highly efficient, capable of producing a relatively powerful bite using low muscle forces.

Two hypotheses have been put forward to explain postorbital bar development and variation in circumorbital form: the facial torsion model and visual predation hypothesis. To test the facial torsion model, we employ strain data on circumorbital and mandibular loading patterns in representative primates with a postorbital bar and masticatory apparatus similar to basal primates. To examine the visual predation hypothesis, we employ metric data on orbit orientation in Paleocene and Eocene primates, as well as several clades of visual predators and foragers that vary interspecifically in postorbital bar formation. A comparison of galago circumorbital and mandibular peak strains during powerful mastication demonstrates that circumorbital strains are quite low. This indicates that, as in anthropoids, the strepsirhine circumorbital region is excessively overbuilt for countering routine masticatory loads. The fact that circumorbital peak-strain levels are uniformly low in both primate suborders undermines any model which posits that masticatory stresses are determinants of circumorbital form, function and evolution. This is interpreted to mean that sufficient cortical bone must exist to prevent structural failure due to non-masticatory traumatic forces. Preliminary data also indicate that the difference between circumorbital and mandibular strains is greater in larger taxa. Comparative analyses of several extant analogs suggest that the postorbital bar apparently provides rigidity to the lateral orbital margins to ensure a high level of visual acuity during chewing and biting. The origin of the primate postorbital bar is linked to changes in orbital convergence and frontation at smaller sizes due to nocturnal visual predation and increased encephalization. By incorporating in vivo and fossil data, we reformulate the visual predation hypothesis of primate origins and thus offer new insights into major adaptive transformations in the primate skull.

In particular, the masseter muscle is highly specialised, having extended anteriorly to originate from the rostrum. All living rodents have achieved this masseteric expansion in one of three ways, known as the sciuromorph, hystricomorph and myomorph conditions. Here, we used finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate the biomechanical implications of these three morphologies, in a squirrel, guinea pig and rat. In particular, we wished to determine whether each of the three morphologies is better adapted for either gnawing or chewing. Results show that squirrels are more efficient at muscle-bite force transmission during incisor gnawing than guinea pigs, and that guinea pigs are more efficient at molar chewing than squirrels. This matches the known diet of nuts and seeds that squirrels gnaw, and of grasses that guinea pigs grind down with their molars. Surprisingly, results also indicate that rats are more efficient as well as more versatile feeders than both the squirrel and guinea pig. There seems to be no compromise in biting efficiency to accommodate the wider range of foodstuffs and the more general feeding behaviour adopted by rats. Our results show that the morphology of the skull and masticatory muscles have allowed squirrels to specialise as gnawers and guinea pigs as chewers, but that rats are high-performance generalists, which helps explain their overwhelming success as a group. © 2012 Cox et al.",,"adaptation; article; biomechanics; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; evolution; feeding behavior; finite element analysis; gnawing; grass; guinea pig; incisor; mastication; masticatory muscle; mechanical stress; molar tooth; motor performance; muscle force; nonhuman; nut; plant seed; rat; Sciuridae; animal; eating; mechanics; muscle; physiology; rodent; skull; Cavia; Hystricognathi; Poaceae; Rattus; Rodentia; Sciuridae; Sciurognathi; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biomechanics; Bite Force; Eating; Mechanical Processes; Muscles; Rats; Rodentia; Skull; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860464120

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

One hypothesis states that masticatory characters are highly prone to homoplasy. A second hypothesis states that such characters are likely to be morphologically integrated and thus violate the assumption of character independence implicit in all phylogenetic analyses. Evaluation of these hypotheses requires that masticatory features be accurately identified, but, to date, there have been relatively few attempts to test precisely which early hominid features are functionally related to chewing. This paper uses finite-element analysis to evaluate the functional relationships of a character-palatal thickness-that is one of several Paranthropus synapomorphies putatively related to mastication. A finite-element model of 145,680 elements was created from sixty-one 2-mm-thick CT scans of a Macaca fascicularis skull. The model was assigned the elastic properties of facial bone and loaded with muscle forces corresponding to the moment of centric occlusion during mastication. The model was constrained so as to produce a reaction force (corresponding to the bite force) at M1. With a few exceptions, the strain patterns in the finite-element model compare well with those gathered from published and unpublished bone-strain experiments. The model was then modified to have a thick palate. The model was reloaded using an identical loading regime, and the strain patterns of the original and thick-palate models were compared. Although a thickened palate acts to reduce palatal strain, strains are elevated in other facial regions. This suggests that a thick palate would not have evolved in isolation as an adaptation to withstand masticatory stress. Rather, a thick palate may have evolved in concert with a suite of other facial features that share a stress-resistance function. This appears to be consistent with hypotheses positing that at least some facial features related to chewing evolved in an integrated fashion. More functional studies of other facial features are needed, as are formal studies of morphological integration. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Such information is important for understanding the functional significance of the mammalian circumorbital region. In this study, bone strain was recorded along the dorsal interorbit, postorbital bar, and mandibular corpus in Otolemur garnettii and O. crassicaudatus (greater galagos) during molar chewing and biting. We determined principal-strain magnitudes and directions, compared peak shear-strain magnitudes between various regions of the face, and compared galago strain patterns with similar experimental data for anthropoids. This suite of analyses were used to test the facial torsion model (Greaves [1985] J Zool (Lond) 207:125-136; [1991] Zool J Linn Soc 101:121-129; [1995] Functional morphology in vertebrate paleontology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p 99-115). A comparison of galago circumorbital and mandibular peak strains during powerful mastication indicates that circumorbital strains are very low in magnitude. This demonstrates that, as in anthropoids, the strepsirhine circumorbital region is highly overbuilt for countering routine masticatory loads. The fact that circumorbital peak-strain magnitudes are uniformly low in both primate suborders undermines any model that emphasizes the importance of masticatory stresses as a determinant of circumorbital form, function, and evolution. Preliminary data also suggest that the difference between mandibular and circumorbital strains is greater in larger-bodied primates. This pattern is interpreted to mean that sufficient cortical bone must exist in the circumorbital region to prevent structural failure due to nonmasticatory traumatic forces. During unilateral mastication, the direction of ε1 at the galago dorsal interorbit indicates the presence of facial torsion combined with bending in the frontal plane. Postorbital bar principal-strain directions during mastication are oriented, on average, very close to 45°relative to the skull's long axis, much as predicted by the facial torsion model. When chewing shifts from one side of the face to the other, there is a characteristic reversal or flip-flop in principal-strain directions for both the interorbit and postorbital bar. Although anthropoids also exhibit an interorbital reversal pattern, peak-strain directions for this clade are opposite those for galagos. The presence of such variation may be due to suborder differences in relative balancing-side jaw-muscle force recruitment. Most importantly, although the strain-direction data for the galago circumorbital region offer support for the occurrence of facial torsion, the low magnitude of these strains suggests that this loading pattern may not be an important determinant of circumorbital morphology.

Stress patterns are generally similar in all taxa with the ventral region of the skull tensed whilst the dorsal aspect is compressed, although the skull is not purely behaving as a cantilever beam as there is no discernible neutral region of bending. Despite similarities, stress patterns are not wholly comparable: there are key differences in how certain regions of the skull contain stress, and it is possible to link such differences to cranial morphology. In particular, nasal morphology can be explained by the stress patterns revealed here. Tyrannosaurus models shear and compress mainly in the nasal region, in keeping with the indistinguishably fused and expanded morphology of the nasal bones. Conversely Allosaurus and Coelophysis models experience peak shear and compression in the fronto-parietal region (which is tightly interdigitated and thickened in the case of Allosaurus) yet in contrast the nasal region is lightly stressed, corresponding to relatively gracile nasals and a frequently patent internasal suture evident in Allosaurus.

Key developments reviewed here include geometric morphometric methods for the analysis and visualization of variations in form (size and shape), finite element methods for the prediction of mechanical performance of skeletal structures under load and multibody dynamics methods for the simulation and prediction of musculoskeletal function. These techniques are all used in studies of form and function in biology, but only recently have they been combined in novel ways to facilitate biomechanical modelling that takes account of variations in form, can statistically compare performance, and relate performance to form and its covariates. Here we provide several examples that illustrate how these approaches can be combined and we highlight areas that require further investigation and development before we can claim a mature theory and toolkit for a statistical biomechanical framework that unites these methods. © 2010 The Authors.

In recent years, biomechanical explanations have received the most attention. Some proponents of the ""anterior dental loading hypothesis"" (ADLH) maintain that Neandertal facial anatomy was an adaptive response to high-magnitude forces resulting from both masticatory and paramasticatory activity. However, while many have argued that Neandertal facial structure was well-adapted to dissipate heavy occlusal loads, few have considered, much less demonstrated, the ability of the Neandertal masticatory system to generate these presumably heavy loads. In fact, the Neandertal masticatory configuration has often been simultaneously interpreted as being disadvantageous for producing large bite forces. With rare exception, analyses that attempted to resolve this conflict were qualitative rather than quantitative. Using a three-dimensional digitizer, we recorded a sequence of points on the cranium and associated mandible of the Amud 1, La Chapelle-aux-Saints, and La Ferrassie 1 Neandertals, and a sample of early and recent modern humans (n = 29), including a subsample with heavy dental wear and documented paramasticatory behavior. From these points, we calculated measures of force-production capability (i.e., magnitudes of muscle force, bite force, and condylar reaction force), measures of force production efficiency (i.e., ratios of force magnitudes and muscle mechanical advantages), and a measure of overall size (i.e., the geometric mean of all linear craniofacial measurements taken). In contrast to the expectations set forth by the ADLH, the primary dichotomy in force-production capability was not between Neandertal and modern specimens, but rather between large (robust) and small (gracile) specimens overall. Our results further suggest that the masticatory system in the genus Homo scales such that a certain level of force-production efficiency is maintained across a considerable range of size and robusticity. Natural selection was probably not acting on Neandertal facial architecture in terms of peak bite force dissipation, but rather on large tooth size to better resist wear and abrasion from submaximal (but more frequent) biting and grinding forces. We conclude that masticatory biomechanical adaptation does not underlie variation in the facial skeleton of later Pleistocene Homo in general, and that continued exploration of alternative explanations for Neandertal facial architecture (e.g., climatic, respiratory, developmental, and/or stochastic mechanisms) seems warranted. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Anterior dental loading; Facial form; Hominid paleontology; Masticatory biomechanics","adaptation; article; craniofacial morphology; facies; female; grinding; hominid; human; male; mandible; mastication; mathematical computing; muscle force; paleontology; Pleistocene; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; skull; tooth; Animals; Anthropometry; Biomechanics; Bite Force; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Biological; Regression Analysis; Skull; Stomatognathic System",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18644377611

However, the accuracy of these assessments has never been evaluated. Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes).

However, in vivo studies are unable to identify or track changes in stress and strain throughout the whole structure. Finite element (FE) analysis, a powerful engineering tool long used to predict the performance of man-made devices, has the capacity to track stress/strain in three dimensions (3-D) and, despite the time-consuming nature of model generation, FE has become an increas-ingly popular analytical device among biomechanists. Here, we apply the finite element method using sophisticated computer models to examine whether 3-D stress and strain distributions are nonuniform throughout the primate skull, as has been strongly suggested by 2-D in vivo strain analyses. Our simulations document steep internal stress/strain gradients, using models comprising up to three million tetrahedral finite elements and 3-D reconstructions of jaw adducting musculature with both cranium and mandible in correct anatomical position. Results are in broad concurrence with the suggestion that few regions of the hominid cranium are clearly optimized for routine feeding and also show that external stress/strain does not necessarily reflect internal distributions. Findings further suggest that the complex heterogeneity of bone in the skull may act to dissipate stress, but that consequently higher strain must be offset by additional strain energy. We hypothesize that, despite energetic costs, this system may lend adaptive advantage through enhancing the organism's ability to modify its behavior before reaching catastrophic failure in bony or dental structures. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Computer-modeling; Cranial morphology; Finite element analysis; Hominidae","article; biomechanics; bone structure; computer simulation; controlled study; finite element analysis; hominid; jaw; mandible; nonhuman; Pan troglodytes; priority journal; skull; stress; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Biomechanics; Computer Simulation; Models, Biological; Muscle, Skeletal; Pan troglodytes; Skull; Hominidae; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-35348897168

One of the most challenging of these applications is Finite Element Analysis (FEA), a potentially powerful non-destructive tool in the prediction of mechanical behaviour. Geometric morphometrics is another typically computer-based approach commonly applied in morphological studies that allows for shape differences between specimens to be quantified and analysed. There has been some integration of these two fields in recent years. Although a number of shape warping approaches have been developed previously, none are easily accessible. Here we present an easily accessed method for warping meshes based on freely available software and test the effectiveness of the approach in FEA using the varanoid lizard mandible as a model. We further present new statistical approaches, strain frequency plots and landmark point strains, to analyse FEA results quantitatively and further integrate FEA with geometric morphometrics. Using strain frequency plots, strain field, bending displacements and landmark point strain data we demonstrate that the mechanical behaviour of warped specimens reproduces that of targets without significant error. The influence of including internal cavity morphology in FEA models was also examined and shown to increase bending displacements and strain magnitudes in FE models. The warping approaches presented here will be useful in a range of applications including the generation and analysis of virtual reconstructions, generic models that approximate species means, hypothetical morphologies and evolutionary intermediaries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Finite Element Analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Landmark point; Varanid; Warping","biomechanics; finite element method; geometry; lizard; morphology; morphometry; quantitative analysis; statistical analysis; three-dimensional modeling; accuracy; anatomic landmark; article; computational biomechanics; computer analysis; computer program; controlled study; finite element analysis; geometric morphometrics; image reconstruction; lizard; mandible; mouth cavity; nonhuman; principal component analysis; priority journal; process optimization; quantitative analysis; species comparison; three dimensional virtual reconstruction; Varanus acanthurus; Varanus exanthematicus; Varanus gouldii; Varanus komodoensis; Varanus salvadorii; Animals; Biomechanics; Biometry; Computational Biology; Finite Element Analysis; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lizards; Mandible; Models, Anatomic; Phylogeny; Stress, Mechanical; Squamata; Varanidae; Varanoidea",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857305496

This loading regime tends to twist the braincase relative to the rostral, tooth bearing part of the skull at the zone of potential weakness between the orbits. This torsional effect is exaggerated, and a postorbital bar is present, in those animals with very large masseter and pterygoid muscles. The lines of action of these muscles are oriented at large angles to the long axis of the skull in lateral view, providing large components of force that twist the skull segments relative to one another. When the temporalis is the dominant muscle, the torsional effect is usually less important, and the bar is absent, because this muscle acts at a smaller angle to the skull axis. The postorbital bar exhibits the predicted three dimensional spatial orientation required to resist torsional forces: it is a segment of an imaginary 45° helix that is wound around the skull, if the skull is idealized as a cylinder. This orientation is significant because, in general, maximum compressive and tensile shear stresses lie along 45° helices on a cylinder loaded in torsion; to resist torsion, material should be placed far from the axis of torsion and along a helix oriented at 45° to the deforming forces. Each half of a supraorbital ridge is also a segment of a 45° helix that is perpendicular to the helix passing through the postorbital bar. This model suggests that the postorbital bar is loaded in compression on the chewing side and in tension on the non‐chewing side; the supraorbital ridge is loaded in tension on the chewing side and in compression on the non‐chewing side. 1985 The Zoological Society of London",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84985336405

Studies using finite element analysis (FEA) have helped to better understand this role and show that the stresses and strains in the alveolar bone are influenced by whether and how PDL is included in FE models. However, when the overall distribution of stresses and strains in crania and mandibles are of interest, PDL is often not included in FE models, although little is known about how this affects the results. Here we study the effect of representing PDL as a layer of solid material with isotropic homogeneous properties in an FE model of a human mandible using a novel application of geometric morphometrics. The results show that the modelling of the PDL affects the deformation and thus strain magnitudes not only of the alveolar bone around the biting tooth, but that the whole mandible deforms differently under load. As a result, the strain in the mandibular corpus is significantly increased when PDL is included, while the strain in the bone beneath the biting tooth is reduced. These results indicate the importance of the PDL in FE studies. Thus we recommend that the PDL should be included in FE models of the masticatory apparatus, with tests to assess the sensitivity of the results to changes in the Young's modulus of the PDL material. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Finite element analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Mandible; Periodontal ligament; Sensitivity analysis","Alveolar bones; FE model; Finite element analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Human mandible; Mandible; Novel applications; Occlusal forces; Periodontal ligament; Solid material; Strain magnitude; Young's Modulus; Bone; Elasticity; Geometry; Ligaments; Sensitivity analysis; Strain; Structural design; Finite element method; alveolar bone; article; biological model; finite element analysis; geometry; jaw malformation; mandibular stiffness; mastication; morphometrics; musculoskeletal system parameters; periodontal ligament; priority journal; stress strain relationship; tooth; weight bearing; Automation; Bone and Bones; Computer Simulation; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Mandible; Mastication; Models, Theoretical; Multivariate Analysis; Muscles; Periodontal Ligament; Pressure; Principal Component Analysis; Stress, Mechanical; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954575370

The complexity of craniofacial skeletal morphology makes it difficult to evaluate these hypotheses with in vivo bone strain data. In this paper, new in vivo bone strain data from the intraorbital surfaces of the supraorbital torus, postorbital bar and postorbital septum, the anterior surface of the postorbital bar, and the anterior root of the zygoma are combined with published data from the supraorbital region and zygomatic arch to evaluate the validity of a finite-element model (FEM) of a macaque cranium during mastication. The behavior of this model is then used to test hypotheses regarding the overall deformation regime in the craniofacial haft of macaques. This FEM constitutes a hypothesis regarding deformation of the facial skeleton during mastication. A simplified verbal description of the deformation regime in the macaque FEM is as follows. Inferior bending and twisting of the zygomatic arches about a rostrocaudal axis exerts inferolaterally directed tensile forces on the lateral orbital wall, bending the wall and the supraorbital torus in frontal planes and bending and shearing the infraorbital region and anterior zygoma root in frontal planes. Similar deformation regimes also characterize the crania of Homo and Gorilla under in vitro loading conditions and may be shared among extant catarrhines. Relatively high strain magnitudes in the anterior root of the zygoma suggest that the morphology of this region may be important for resisting forces generated during feeding. © 2010 The Authors.

Phylogenetic placement remains uncertain, but broad consensus has been achieved regarding diet, with all recent authors agreeing that T. carnifex was a carnivore.

Here I apply a rapidly emerging new approach in comparative biology, finite-element analysis, to the examination of cranial mechanics in T. carnifex. Comparisons are made with an extant lion Panthera leo (Linnaeus, 1758) under simulations designed to model stress distributions imposed by biting (intrinsic loads) and interaction with struggling prey (extrinsic loads). Modelling that approximates the 3-D architecture of jaw adductors suggests that both the placental and marsupial lions could generate considerably greater bite forces than has been predicted using 2-D approaches, but with relatively greater forces in the marsupial. The distribution of cranial stress is in many respects similar in both species, but results from simulations of extrinsic forces suggest that the marsupial was particularly well adapted to resist the high stresses that would be expected in dealings with relatively large prey. On the other hand, relatively high stress recorded in the rostrum of T. carnifex under intrinsic loadings suggests that it may have deployed a very different modus operandi, wherein the carnassial teeth played an active role in effecting a kill. © 2007 The Authors.","Feeding behaviour; Finite-element analysis; Panthera; Thylacoleo","cladistics; comparative study; cranium; extinction; feeding behavior; finite element method; marsupial; morphology; phylogeny; Australasia; Australia; Mammalia; Metatheria; Panthera; Panthera leo; Thylacoleo; Thylacoleo carnifex",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41749125907

Engineering techniques such as finite element analysis are now commonly used to calculate stress and strain fields, but if we are to fully accept these methods we must be confident that the applied loading regimens are reasonable. Multibody dynamics analysis (MDA) is a relatively new three dimensional computer modeling technique that can be used to apply varying muscle forces to predict joint and bite forces during static and dynamic motions. The method ensures that equilibrium of the structure is maintained at all times, even for complex statically indeterminate problems, eliminating nonphysiological constraint conditions often seen with other approaches. This study describes the novel use of MDA to investigate the influence of different muscle representations on a macaque skull model (Macaca fascicularis), where muscle groups were represented by either a single, multiple, or wrapped muscle fibers. The impact of varying muscle representation on stress fields was assessed through additional finite element simulations. The MDA models highlighted that muscle forces varied with gape and that forces within individual muscle groups also varied; for example, the anterior strands of the superficial masseter were loaded to a greater extent than the posterior strands. The direction of the muscle force was altered when temporalis muscle wrapping was modeled, and was coupled with compressive contact forces applied to the frontal, parietal and temporal bones of the cranium during biting. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Bite force; Finite element analysis; Macaque; Multibody dynamics analysis; Muscle force","article; compressive strength; computer model; finite element analysis; frontal bone; jaw muscle; Macaca; male; masseter muscle; mastication; masticatory muscle; muscle cell; muscle force; musculoskeletal function; nonhuman; priority journal; skull; temporal bone; temporalis muscle; Animals; Biomechanics; Bite Force; Finite Element Analysis; Macaca fascicularis; Masticatory Muscles; Skull; Temporomandibular Joint; Macaca fascicularis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-43149107457

Finite element analyses simulating molar and premolar biting were used to test the hypothesis that the cranium of A. africanus is structurally more rigid than that of Macaca fascicularis, an Old World monkey that lacks derived australopith facial features. Previously generated finite element models of crania of these species were subjected to isometrically scaled loads, permitting a direct comparison of strain magnitudes. Moreover, strain energy (SE) in the models was compared after results were scaled to account for differences in bone volume and muscle forces. Results indicate that strains in certain skeletal regions below the orbits are higher in M. fascicularis than in A. africanus. Moreover, although premolar bites produce von Mises strains in the rostrum that are elevated relative to those produced by molar biting in both species, rostral strains are much higher in the macaque than in the australopith. These data suggest that at least the midface of A. africanus is more rigid than that of M. fascicularis. Comparisons of SE reveal that the A. africanus cranium is, overall, more rigid than that of M. fascicularis during premolar biting. This is consistent with the hypothesis that this hominin may have periodically consumed large, hard food items. However, the SE data suggest that the A. africanus cranium is marginally less rigid than that of the macaque during molar biting. It is hypothesized that the SE results are being influenced by the allometric scaling of cranial cortical bone thickness. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Bone; Diet; Finite element analysis; Hominin; Human evolution; Skull; Strain","adaptation; allometry; article; Australopithecus africanus; biomechanics; bone; craniofacial morphology; diet; feeding; finite element analysis; Macaca; monkey; muscle; nonhuman; premolar tooth; priority journal; skeleton; skull; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biomechanics; Diet; Evolution; Finite Element Analysis; Hominidae; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Skull; Australopithecus africanus; Cercopithecidae; Crania; Macaca fascicularis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950872977

Biomechanical models of the mammalian masticatory system were traditionally based on a simple classification of feeding types and prediction of function from form. The functional significance of spatial relationships between teeth, muscles and jaw joint, the shape of the mandible and sizes of the jaw muscles were explained in terms of optimal transmission of muscle forces to a specific bite point. Direct, experimental study of jaw movements and muscle activities has revealed new data, highly relevant to the construction of realistic mechanical models and the explanation of aspects of the morphology of the chewing apparatus. The jaw muscles do not reach comparable percentages of their maximum force simultaneously. The relative involvement of each muscle depends on the bite point. During mastication they fire in complicated patterns of successive, partially overlapping contractions. The linear relationship between electromyogram and muscular tension may be employed to estimate muscular tension in vivo. Computed resultant forces gradually change in magnitude and direction during chewing cycles; there is a close correlation with the jaw movements. The necessity to perform the movements may be an extra constraint on jaw muscle morphology. If muscle force estimates are used in a threedimensional static analysis, bite forces and joint reaction forces are found, different from those resulting from one- (simple lever) or two-dimensional static analysis. The explanation of tooth and joint morphology is influenced by these modifications. ©1980 by the American Society of Zoologists.",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000372846

However, this hypothesis appears inconsistent with recent reconstructions of early hominin diet based on dental microwear and stable isotopes. Thus, it is likely that either the diets of some australopiths included a high proportion of foods these taxa were poorly adapted to consume (i.e., foods that they would not have processed efficiently), or that aspects of what we thought we knew about the functional morphology of teeth must be wrong. Evaluation of these possibilities requires a recognition that analyses based on microwear, isotopes, finite element modeling, and enamel chips and cracks each test different types of hypotheses and allow different types of inferences. Microwear and isotopic analyses are best suited to reconstructing broad dietary patterns, but are limited in their ability to falsify specific hypotheses about morphological adaptation. Conversely, finite element analysis is a tool for evaluating the mechanical basis of form-function relationships, but says little about the frequency with which specific behaviors were performed or the particular types of food that were consumed. Enamel chip and crack analyses are means of both reconstructing diet and examining biomechanics. We suggest that current evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that certain derived australopith traits are adaptations for consuming hard foods, but that australopiths had generalized diets that could include high proportions of foods that were both compliant and tough. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Australopithecus; biomechanics; carbon isotope; microwear; Paranthropus","biomechanics; diet; enamel; evolutionary adaptation; feeding behavior; finite element analysis; fossil hominin; morphology; review; tooth; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Anthropology; Biological Evolution; Carbon Isotopes; Dental Enamel; Diet; Eating; Finite Element Analysis; Hominidae",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879394783

FEA is also a powerful tool for studying patterns of stress and strain in fossil animals and artificial constructs hypothesized to represent ancestral conditions. FEA has been used deductively, to study patterns of growth and development, and to investigate whether skull shapes can be created from amorphous blocks using an iterative approach of loading and removing elements. Several of the papers address methodological issues, such as the relative importance of loading conditions and material properties for generating an accurate model and the validation of models using in vivo strain data.

Forceful masticatory muscle activity may also induce deformations of the dento-alveolar tissues and the supporting skeleton, yielding various tooth loads despite an apparently even distribution of tooth contacts. To investigate this variability, we measured bite forces simultaneously at multiple dental sites during maximum-effort clenching tasks. In each of four healthy adults with complete natural dentitions, four strain-gauge transducers in the right side of an acrylic maxillary appliance occluded with the lower canine, second premolar, and first and second molars. These, and matching contralateral contacts, were balanced by means of articulating paper and a force monitor (type F appliance). Bite forces were recorded when the subjects, without visual feedback, clenched maximally on the appliance. Similar recordings were made when contralateral molar and all contralateral contacts were removed (type R and type U appliances, respectively). Although the relation between individual forces often changed during the initial increase in force, it was generally constant around the maximum. The maximum forces at the four dental locations varied in distribution between subjects, but were characterized by posteriorly increasing forces. Forces in the anterior region (especially at the canine) significantly increased (up to 10 times) when clenching took place on unilateral contacts only (type U) as compared with fully balanced ones (type F). Bite force distribution thus changed with biting strength and the location of occlusal contacts. Increased force in the canine region during unilateral clenching seems related to the pattern of jaw muscle co-activation and the physical properties of the craniomandibular and dental supporting tissues which induce complex deformations of the lower jaw.","Bite force distribution; Human jaw biomechanics; Jaw muscle activity; Mandibular elasticity; Occlusion","adult; analysis of variance; article; comparative study; dental care; human; male; mastication; muscle contraction; nonparametric test; tooth radiography; transducer; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Bite Force; Dental Stress Analysis; Humans; Jaw Relation Record; Male; Muscle Contraction; Statistics, Nonparametric; Transducers",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031158389

Strait, D.S., Department of Anthropology, University at Albany, Albany, NY, United States","The African Plio-Pleistocene hominins known as australopiths evolved derived craniodental features frequently interpreted as adaptations for feeding on either hard, or compliant/tough foods. Among australopiths, Paranthropus boisei is the most robust form, exhibiting traits traditionally hypothesized to produce high bite forces efficiently and strengthen the face against feeding stresses. However, recent mechanical analyses imply that P. boisei may not have been an efficient producer of bite force and that robust morphology in primates is not necessarily strong. Here we use an engineering method, finite element analysis, to show that the facial skeleton of P. boisei is structurally strong, exhibits a strain pattern different from that in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Australopithecus africanus, and efficiently produces high bite force. It has been suggested that P. boisei consumed a diet of compliant/tough foods like grass blades and sedge pith. However, the blunt occlusal topography of this and other species suggests that australopiths are adapted to consume hard foods, perhaps including grass and sedge seeds. A consideration of evolutionary trends in morphology relating to feeding mechanics suggests that food processing behaviors in gracile australopiths evidently were disrupted by environmental change, perhaps contributing to the eventual evolution of Homo and Paranthropus.

Finite element analysis (FEA) is an ideal technique to investigate the biomechanical implications of these specializations, but it is essential to understand fully the degree of influence of the different input parameters of the FE model to have confidence in the model's predictions. This study evaluates the sensitivity of FE models of rodent crania to elastic properties of the materials, loading direction, and the location and orientation of the models' constraints. Three FE models were constructed of squirrel, guinea pig and rat skulls. Each was loaded to simulate biting on the incisors, and the first and the third molars, with the angle of the incisal bite varied over a range of 45°. The Young's moduli of the bone and teeth components were varied between limits defined by findings from our own and previously published tests of material properties. Geometric morphometrics (GMM) was used to analyse the resulting skull deformations. Bone stiffness was found to have the strongest influence on the results in all three rodents, followed by bite position, and then bite angle and muscle orientation. Tooth material properties were shown to have little effect on the deformation of the skull. The effect of bite position varied between species, with the mesiodistal position of the biting tooth being most important in squirrels and guinea pigs, whereas bilateral vs. unilateral biting had the greatest influence in rats. A GMM analysis of isolated incisor deformations showed that, for all rodents, bite angle is the most important parameter, followed by elastic properties of the tooth. The results here elucidate which input parameters are most important when defining the FE models, but also provide interesting glimpses of the biomechanical differences between the three skulls, which will be fully explored in future publications. © 2011 The Authors.

For examining the effect of tooth sockets, the unloaded sockets were modeled as devoid of teeth and PDL, filled with teeth and PDLs, or simply filled with cortical bone. The third premolar on the left side of the cranium was loaded and the PDL was treated as an isotropic, linear elastic material using published values for Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. The remaining models, along with one of the socket models, were used to determine the effect of the PDL's material behavior on stress and strain distributions under static premolar biting and dynamic tooth loading conditions. Two models (one static and the other dynamic) treated the PDL as cortical bone. The other two models treated it as a ligament with isotropic, linear elastic material properties. Two models treated the PDL as a ligament with hyperelastic properties, and the other two as a ligament with viscoelastic properties. Both behaviors were defined using published stress-strain data obtained from in vitro experiments on porcine ligament specimens. Von Mises stress and strain contour plots indicate that the effects of the sockets and PDL material behavior are local. Results from this study suggest that modeling the sockets and the PDL in finite element analyses of skulls is project dependent and can be ignored if values of stress and strain within the alveolar region are not required. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Dynamic tooth loading; Finite element analysis; Hyperelastic; Linear elastic; Periodontal ligament; Premolar biting; Tooth sockets; Viscoelastic","Hyper elastic; Linear elastic; Periodontal ligament; Premolar biting; Tooth sockets; Viscoelastic; Biomechanics; Bone; Elasticity; Materials; Poisson ratio; Strain; Stress analysis; Finite element method; animal tissue; article; biomechanics; Cebus; controlled study; cortical bone; craniofacial morphology; feeding; finite element analysis; in vitro study; male; mastication; nonhuman; periodontal ligament; premolar tooth; priority journal; stress strain relationship; tooth socket; viscoelasticity; Young modulus; Alveolar Process; Animals; Biomechanics; Cebus; Elasticity; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Models, Biological; Periodontal Ligament; Poisson Distribution; Stress, Mechanical; Tooth Socket",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959529612

However, the expense and time required to create models from specimens has prevented comparative studies from involving large numbers of species. A new method is presented for transforming existing FE models using geometric morphometric methods. Homologous landmark coordinates are digitized on the FE model and on a target specimen into which the FE model is being transformed. These coordinates are used to create a thin-plate spline function and coefficients, which are then applied to every node in the FE model. This function smoothly interpolates the location of points between landmarks, transforming the geometry of the original model to match the target. This new FE model is then used as input in FE analyses. This procedure is demonstrated with turtle shells: a Glyptemys muhlenbergii model is transformed into Clemmys guttata and Actinemys marmorata models. Models are loaded and the resulting stresses are compared. The validity of the models is tested by crushing actual turtle shells in a materials testing machine and comparing those results to predictions from FE models. General guidelines, cautions, and possibilities for this procedure are also presented. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Biomechanics; Finite element analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Thin-plate spine; Turtle shell","anatomy; biomechanics; comparative study; finite element method; model validation; morphometry; shell; turtle; animal; article; audiovisual equipment; compressive strength; computer graphics; finite element analysis; histology; mechanical stress; methodology; reproducibility; three dimensional imaging; turtle; Animals; Compressive Strength; Computer Graphics; Finite Element Analysis; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Models, Anatomic; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Mechanical; Turtles; Actinemys marmorata; Clemmys guttata; Glyptemys muhlenbergii; Testudines",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-64749116215

However, the nature of the stresses and the mechanical adaptations to counter them are estimated differently. The peripheral position of the walls of the maxillary sinuses imparts torsional resistance in all directions to the projecting part of the face. The inflated maxilla and convex midfacial profile reduce bending in the sagittal plane, as does the straight infrazygomatic contour in the frontal plane. The elimination of angles between the infraorbital plate, the maxillary side walls and the zygomatic body reduces local stress concentrations. © 1987.","craniofacial form; functional morphology; neandertal",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000631223

Multivariate statistics applied to both traditional and geometric morphometric analyses failed to reveal any important changes in shape through time. However, the coefficients of variation presented a significant increase through time in three measurements related to projectile point neck and stem. The absence of change in shape might be related to small group size and low level of cultural innovation. Such cultural stability might be related to novelty-avoiding mechanisms or the operation of a meta-tradition that would be selected in very stable environments.

Here we perform functional analyses of the skull of the medium-sized (,40 kg) patagornithine phorusrhacid Andalgalornis steulleti (upper Miocene-lower Pliocene, Andalgalá Formation, Catamarca, Argentina) to assess its mechanical performance in a comparative context. Based on computed tomographic (CT) scanning and morphological analysis, the skull of Andalgalornis steulleti is interpreted as showing features reflecting loss of intracranial immobility. Discrete anatomical attributes permitting such cranial kinesis are widespread phorusrhacids outgroups, but this is the first clear evidence of loss of cranial kinesis in a gruiform bird and may be among the best documented cases among all birds. This apomorphic loss is interpreted as an adaptation for enhanced craniofacial rigidity, particularly with regard to sagittal loading. We apply a Finite Element approach to a three-dimensional (3D) model of the skull. Based on regression analysis we estimate the bite force of Andalgalornis at the bill tip to be 133 N. Relative to results obtained from Finite Element Analysis of one of its closest living relatives (seriema) and a large predatory bird (eagle), the phorusrhacid's skull shows relatively high stress under lateral loadings, but low stress where force is applied dorsoventrally (sagittally) and in ''pullback'' simulations. Given the relative weakness of the skull mediolaterally, it seems unlikely that Andalgalornis engaged in potentially risky behaviors that involved subduing large, struggling prey with its beak. We suggest that it either consumed smaller prey that could be killed and consumed more safely (e.g., swallowed whole) or that it used multiple well-targeted sagittal strikes with the beak in a repetitive attack-and-retreat strategy.© 2010 Degrange et al.",,"Andalgalornis steulleti; animal behavior; animal tissue; article; bird; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; evolutionary adaptation; feeding behavior; functional morphology; mastication; nonhuman; predator stress; animal; biomechanics; bird; finite element analysis; orientation; skull; species extinction; Aves; Gruiformes; Pisonia aculeata; Animals; Biomechanics; Birds; Bite Force; Extinction, Biological; Feeding Behavior; Finite Element Analysis; Kinesis; Skull",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957860814

Modern computer simulation packages make producing such models straightforward and it is tempting to take the results produced at face value. However the predictions of a simulation are only valid when both the model and the input parameters are accurate and little work has been done to verify this. In this paper a model of the human jaw is produced and a sensitivity analysis is performed to validate the results. The model is built using the ADAMS multibody dynamic simulation package incorporating the major occlusive muscles of mastication (temporalis, masseter, medial and lateral pterygoids) as well as a highly mobile temporomandibular joint. This model is used to predict the peak three-dimensional bite forces at each teeth location, joint reaction forces, and the contributions made by each individual muscle. The results for occlusive bite-force (1080N at M1) match those previously published suggesting the model is valid. The sensitivity analysis was performed by sampling the input parameters from likely ranges and running the simulation many times rather than using single, best estimate values. This analysis shows that the magnitudes of the peak retractive forces on the lower teeth were highly sensitive to the chosen origin (and hence fibre direction) of the temporalis and masseter muscles as well as the laxity of the TMJ. Peak protrusive force was also sensitive to the masseter origin. These result shows that the model is insufficiently complex to estimate these values reliably although the much lower sensitivity values obtained for the bite forces in the other directions and also for the joint reaction forces suggest that these predictions are sound. Without the sensitivity analysis it would not have been possible to identify these weaknesses which strongly supports the use of sensitivity analysis as a validation technique for biomechanical modelling.",,"accuracy; article; biomechanics; computer model; computer program; computer simulation; controlled study; functional anatomy; masseter muscle; mastication; masticatory muscle; muscle contraction; muscle force; prediction; reliability; sensitivity analysis; temporalis muscle; temporomandibular joint; validation process",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242330289

One long-held explanation for the variation in early Paleoindian point form is that prey size influenced the size and shape of projectile points. The study reported here evaluated this hypothesis with standard and geometric morphometric data recorded on Clovis and Folsom points from the Southern Plains and Southwest that are associated with mammoth or bison remains. Points used to hunt mammoth were found to be larger and of a different shape than points used to hunt bison, which supports the hypothesis. However, when both point type and prey size were taken into account, the results ran counter to predictions.

In such validation experiments, the strains in the loaded bones are usually measured with strain gauges glued to the bone surface, but the use of strain gauges on bone can be difficult and provides only very limited data regarding surface strain distributions. This study applies the full-field strain measurement technique of digital speckle pattern interferometry to measure strains in a loaded human mandible and compares the results with the predictions of voxel-based finite element models of the same specimen. It is found that this novel strain measurement technique yields consistent, reliable measurements. Further, strains predicted by the finite element analysis correspond well with the experimental data. These results not only confirm the usefulness of this technique for future validation studies in the field of bone mechanics, but also show that the modelling approach used in this study is able to predict the experimental results very accurately. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the change could be related to a change in the bite direction. We have measured the MBF on incisors and its direction in three dimensions for different jaw openings in ten subjects. Surface electromyography (EMG) of anterior temporalis and masseter muscles on both sides was recorded simultaneously. The results showed that: (1) the average %MBF increased as the jaw was opened, reached a plateau between 14 and 28 mm of incisal separation, and then decreased at wider jaw openings; (2) the initial forward bite direction with respect to the mandibular occlusal plane shifted backwards during jaw opening; and (3) the activity of the masseter muscles declined and that of the temporalis muscles was largely unchanged, resulting in an increase of the ratio between the activity in temporalis and masseter muscles (T/M). There was a significant correlation between bite direction and jaw opening (r = 0.51, p < 0.001) and between T/M ratio and jaw opening (r = 0.56, p < 0.001). Based on comparative data, we have calculated sarcomere lengths while the jaw is opened and hypothesize that the average %MBF reaches its maximum when the sarcomeres in the masseter muscle achieve their optimum length. A plateau continues during further jaw opening, until those of temporalis reach their optimum length while those of masseter lengthen beyond their optimum length. The change in bite direction was attributed to either a change in the relation between upper and lower bite points as the jaw was opened or the gradual decline of masseter activity at larger openings.","Bite force direction; Jaw opening; Maximum bite force; Transducer","adult; article; biomechanics; dental care; electromyography; female; human; jaw; joint characteristics and functions; male; masseter muscle; mastication; nonparametric test; physiology; sarcomere; signal processing; statistical model; temporalis muscle; temporomandibular joint; tooth occlusion; transducer; Adult; Biomechanics; Bite Force; Dental Stress Analysis; Electromyography; Female; Humans; Jaw; Linear Models; Male; Masseter Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Sarcomeres; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Statistics, Nonparametric; Temporal Muscle; Temporomandibular Joint; Transducers; Vertical Dimension",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030639094

In this study, eight suture-bone functional units representing eight facial sutures were created in a finite element model of a monkey cranium. All the sutures were assumed to have identical isotropic linear elastic material behavior that varied in different modeling experiments, representing either fused or unfused sutures. The values of elastic moduli employed in these trials ranged over several orders of magnitude. Each model was evaluated under incisor, premolar, and molar biting conditions. Results demonstrate that skulls with unfused sutures permitted more deformations and experienced higher total strain energy. However, strain patterns remained relatively unaffected away from the suture sites, and bite reaction force was likewise barely affected. These findings suggest that suture elasticity does not substantially alter load paths through the macaque skull or its underlying rigid body kinematics. An implication is that, for the purposes of finite element analysis, omitting or fusing sutures is a reasonable modeling approximation for skulls with small suture volume fraction if the research objective is to observe general patterns of craniofacial biomechanics under static loading conditions. The manner in which suture morphology and ossification affect the mechanical integrity of skulls and their ontogeny and evolution awaits further investigation, and their viscoelastic properties call for dynamic simulations. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Bone biomechanics; Elastic properties; Static loading; Structural stiffness; Suture fusion","article; biomechanics; bone structure; craniofacial morphology; finite element analysis; incisor; kinematics; Macaca; molar tooth; nonhuman; ontogeny; ossification; premolar tooth; priority journal; skull; skull suture; temporomandibular joint; anatomy and histology; animal; audiovisual equipment; cranial suture; male; mastication; Young modulus; Primates; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bite Force; Cranial Sutures; Elastic Modulus; Finite Element Analysis; Macaca; Male; Models, Anatomic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956568830

With sensitivity analyses it is possible to assess how the choice of different input values and the degree of model simplification affect FEA results. However, published FEA studies are rarely accompanied by sensitivity analyses so that the robusticity of their results is impossible to assess. Here, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with an FE model of a human mandible to quantify the relative importance of several modeling decisions: (1) the material properties assigned to the cancellous bone tissue; (2) the inclusion or not of the periodontal ligament; (3) the constraints at the joints and bite point; and (4) the orientation of applied muscle forces. We study the effects of varying these properties by analysing the strain magnitudes and directions across the model surface. In addition, we perform a geometric morphometric analysis of the deformation resulting from the loading of each model. The results show that the effects of altering the different model properties can be significant and that most effects are potentially large enough to cause problems for the biological interpretation of FEA results.

Humans are generally believed to produce low bite forces and spend less time chewing compared with other apes because advances in mechanical and thermal food processing techniques alter food material properties in such a way as to reduce overall masticatory effort. However, when hominins began regularly consuming mechanically processed or cooked diets is not known. Here, we apply a model for estimating maximum bite forces and stresses at the second molar in modern human, nonhuman primate, and hominin skulls that incorporates skeletal data along with species-specific estimates of jaw muscle architecture. The model, which reliably estimates bite forces, shows a significant relationship between second molar bite force and second molar area across species but does not confirm our hypothesis of isometry. Specimens in the genus Homo fall below the regression line describing the relationship between bite force and molar area for nonhuman anthropoids and australopiths. These results suggest that Homo species generate maximum bite forces below those predicted based on scaling among australopiths and nonhuman primates. Because this decline occurred before evidence for cooking, we hypothesize that selection for lower bite force production was likely made possible by an increased reliance on nonthermal food processing. However, given substantial variability among in vivo bite force magnitudes measured in humans, environmental effects, especially variations in food mechanical properties, may also be a factor. The results also suggest that australopiths had ape-like bite force capabilities. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","diet; fossil hominins; masticatory biomechanics","article; craniofacial morphology; female; fossil hominin; jaw muscle; male; mastication; mathematical analysis; molar tooth; nonhuman; primate; skeleton; diet; fossil hominins; masticatory biomechanics; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bite Force; Diet; Female; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Molar; Muscle, Skeletal; Species Specificity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880550247

Some hypotheses propose that it is an adaptation to specific loads occurring during masticatory function. This study uses finite element analysis to examine these symphyseal loads in a model of a modern human mandible. By modifying the symphyseal cross-sectional form, the mechanical significance of the presence of the chin and symphyseal orientation is tested, and modern human and Neanderthal symphyseal cross-sections are compared with regard to their ability to withstand different loads. The results show that changes in symphyseal form have profound effects on the strains. The presence of a chin leads to lower symphyseal strains overall, whereas a vertical orientation of the symphysis results in higher strains under wishboning, but not under vertical bending in the coronal plane and dorsoventral shear. Compared to Neanderthals, the modern human symphysis shows higher strains during dorsoventral shear and wishboning, but is as effective as the Neanderthal symphysis in resisting vertical bending in the coronal plane and the loads resulting from simulated incision and unilateral molar biting. In general, the results of this study corroborate prior hypotheses about the mechanical effects of the human chin and vertical symphyseal orientation and support the idea that the relative importance of wishboning and vertical bending in the coronal plane might have played a role in the evolution of modern human symphyseal morphology. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Chin; Finite element analysis; Mandible; Neanderthals","article; chin; dentition; finite element analysis; mandible; mastication; Animals; Biomechanics; Chin; Finite Element Analysis; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Mastication; Models, Biological; Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952773335

Virtual anthropology (VA) contributes to comparative morphology by taking advantage of technological innovations, and it also offers new opportunities for functional analyses. It exploits digital technologies and pools experts from different domains such as anthropology, primatology, medicine, paleontology, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and engineering. VA as a technical term was coined in the late 1990s from the perspective of anthropologists with the intent of being mostly applied to biological questions concerning recent and fossil hominoids. More generally, however, there are advanced methods to study shape and size or to manipulate data digitally suitable for application to all kinds of primates, mammals, other vertebrates, and invertebrates or to issues regarding plants, tools, or other objects. In this sense, we could also call the field ""virtual morphology."" The approach yields permanently available virtual copies of specimens and data that comprehensively quantify geometry, including previously neglected anatomical regions. It applies advanced statistical methods, supports the reconstruction of specimens based on reproducible manipulations, and promotes the acquisition of larger samples by data sharing via electronic archives. Finally, it can help identify new, hidden traits, which is particularly important in paleoanthropology, where the scarcity of material demands extracting information from fragmentary remains. This contribution presents a current view of the six main work steps of VA: digitize, expose, compare, reconstruct, materialize, and share. The VA machinery has also been successfully used in biomechanical studies which simulate the stress and strains appearing in structures. Although methodological issues remain to be solved before results from the two domains can be fully integrated, the various overlaps and cross-fertilizations suggest the widespread appearance of a ""virtual functional morphology"" in the near future. © 2014 American Association of Physical Anthropologists.","Biomechanics; Comparative morphology; Functional morphology; Geometric morphometrics; Human evolution; Shape and form analysis; Virtual anthropology; Virtual morphology","animals; anthropology; anthropology, physical; archaeology; biomechanics; biometry; comparative anatomy; Computational Biology; computer assisted tomography; evolution; fossil; Fossils; functional morphology; history; Hominidae; human; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; methods; morphometrics; nonhuman; paleoanthropology; physical anthropology; Review; trends; virtual anthropology; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Archaeology; Biometry; Computational Biology; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; methods; methods; methods; methods; trends; trends",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964253659

However, in the absence of corresponding muscle activation patterns, incomplete muscle data recorded experimentally for different individuals during different feeding tasks are frequently substituted. This study uses finite element analysis (FEA) to examine the sensitivity of the mechanical response of a Macaca fascicularis cranium to varying muscle activation patterns predicted via multibody dynamic analysis. Relative to the effects of varying bite location, the consequences of simulated variations in muscle activation patterns and of the inclusion/exclusion of whole muscle groups were investigated. The resulting cranial deformations were compared using two approaches; strain maps and geometric morphometric analyses. The results indicate that, with bite force magnitude controlled, the variations among the mechanical responses of the cranium to bite location far outweigh those observed as a consequence of varying muscle activations. However, zygomatic deformation was an exception, with the activation levels of superficial masseter being most influential in this regard. The anterior portion of temporalis deforms the cranial vault, but the remaining muscles have less profound effects. This study for the first time systematically quantifies the sensitivity of an FEA model of a primate skull to widely varying masticatory muscle activations and finds that, with the exception of the zygomatic arch, reasonable variants of muscle loading for a second molar bite have considerably less effect on cranial deformation and the resulting strain map than does varying molar bite point. The implication is that FEA models of biting crania will generally produce acceptable estimates of deformation under load as long as muscle activations and forces are reasonably approximated. In any one FEA study, the biological significance of the error in applied muscle forces is best judged against the magnitude of the effect that is being investigated. © 2012 The Authors.

It has been suggested that the periodontal ligament (PDL) plays a key role. However, the mechanical function of the PDL in orthodontic tooth movement is not well understood as most mechanical models of the PDL to date have ignored the fibrous structure of the PDL. In this study we use finite element (FE) analysis to investigate the strains in the alveolar bone due to occlusal and orthodontic loads when PDL is modelled as a fibrous structure as compared to modelling PDL as a layer of solid material. The results show that the tension-only nature of the fibres essentially suspends the tooth in the tooth socket and their inclusion in FE models makes a significant difference to both the magnitude and distribution of strains produced in the surrounding bone. The results indicate that the PDL fibres have a very important role in load transfer between the teeth and alveolar bone and should be considered in FE studies investigating the biomechanics of orthodontic tooth movement. © 2014 McCormack et al.",,"alveolar bone; article; biomechanics; bone stress; bone structure; computer model; finite element analysis; musculoskeletal function; orthodontics; periodontal ligament; tooth socket; biomechanics; bone remodeling; cytology; finite element analysis; human; mechanical stress; mechanics; periodontal disease; periodontal ligament; physiology; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Remodeling; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Mechanical Processes; Periodontal Ligament; Stress, Mechanical; Tooth Movement",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904572642

The models were loaded using force estimates derived from muscle architecture in dissected specimens, constrained at the 18th and 19th teeth in the upper jaw and 19th tooth of the lower jaw, as well as at the quadrate-articular joint. Stiffness was varied systematically in each theoretical phenotype. The three theoretical phenotypes included: (i) linear elastic isotropic bone of varying stiffness and no sutures; (ii) linear elastic orthotropic bone of varying stiffness with no sutures; and (iii) linear elastic isotropic bone of a constant stiffness with varying suture stiffness. Variation in the isotropic material properties of bone primarily resulted in changes in the magnitude of principal strain. By comparison, variation in the orthotropic material properties of bone and isotropic material properties of sutures resulted in: a greater number of bricks becoming either more compressive or more tensile, changing between being either dominantly compressive or tensile, and having larger changes in the orientation of maximum principal strain. These data indicate that variation in these model properties resulted in changes to the strain regime of the model, highlighting the importance of using biologically verified material properties when modeling vertebrate bones. When bones were compared within each set, the response of each to changing material properties varied. In two of the 12 bones in the mandible, varied material properties within sutures resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of principal strain in bricks adjacent to the bone/suture interface and decreases in stored elastic energy. The varied response of the mandibular bones to changes in suture stiffness highlights the importance of defining the appropriate functional unit when addressing relationships of performance and morphology. © 2010 The Authors.

Here, we apply three-dimensional finite element analysis to models representing five extant and one fossil species of bear. The ability to generate high bite forces, and for the skull to sustain them, is present in both the giant panda and the gigantic extinct Agriotherium africanum. Bite forces for A.africanum are the highest predicted for any mammalian carnivore. Our findings do not resolve whether A.africanum was more likely a predator on, or scavenger of, large terrestrial vertebrates, but show that its skull was well-adapted to resist the forces generated in either activity. The possibility that A.africanum was adapted to process tough vegetation is discounted.

While this approach has obvious appeal for the study of fossil specimens, such material is often fragmentary with disrupted internal architecture and can contain matrix that leads to errors in accurate segmentation. Here we examine the effects of varying the detail of segmentation and material properties of teeth on the performance of a finite element model of a Macaca fascicularis cranium within a comparative functional framework. Cranial deformations were compared using strain maps to assess differences in strain contours and Procrustes size and shape analyses, from geometric morphometrics, were employed to compare large scale deformations. We show that a macaque model subjected to biting can be made solid, and teeth altered in material properties, with minimal impact on large scale modes of deformation. The models clustered tightly by bite point rather than by modeling simplification approach, and fell out as being distinct from another species. However localized fluctuations in predicted strain magnitudes were recorded with different modeling approaches, particularly over the alveolar region. This study indicates that, while any model simplification should be undertaken with care and attention to its effects, future applications of FEA to fossils with unknown internal architecture may produce reliable results with regard to general modes of deformation, even when detail of internal bone architecture cannot be reliably modeled.

Zooarchaeologists have attempted to study these changes osteologically in their search for the geographic and temporal origins of initial animal domestication during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Traditional biometric approaches have explored broad changes in body size over time, but this approach provides poor resolution. Here we investigate whether geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of cranial shape can be used to provide better resolution between wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), since shape is less affected by environmental factors than size. GMM combined with traditional multivariate statistics were applied to the crania of 42 modern domestic pigs (representing 6 breeds), 10 wild×domestic first generation hybrid pigs and 55 adult wild boar. Further analyses were carried out on morphologically discrete portions of the crania to simulate the fragmented nature of archaeological mammal remains. We found highly significant discrimination between wild and domestic pigs, both on the whole crania, and subsets including the parietal, the basicranium, the angle of the nasal and the zygomatic. We also demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate different domestic breeds on the basis of cranial morphology, and that 1st generation hybrid wild×domestic pig morphology more closely resembles wild pigs than domestic, suggesting that a wild phenotype (here represented by morphology) is dominant over a recessive domestic one. Our data demonstrate that GMM techniques can provide a quantifiable, clear classification between wild and domestic Sus (even using partial cranial remains) which has significant implications for zooarchaeological research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Crania; Domestication; Geometric morphometrics; Sus scrofa; Zooarchaeology","archaeology; biometry; body size; domestication; Holocene; morphometry; phenotype; pig; three-dimensional modeling; Animalia; Crania; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892961583

To these ends we apply these methods to a study of coronal plane forces applied to a model of an armadillo femur. We simulate the stance phase in the hind limb where the femur is subject to bending strains due to longitudinal compressive as well as abduction loads on the greater trochanter. We use this model to examine the hypothesis that muscles attaching to the third trochanter can reduce these bending strains in the loaded femur. The analysis uses standard finite element methods to produce strain maps and examine the strains at 200 point locations on the femur, but we also use the locations of the 200 points to run novel geometric morphometric analyses to assess the gross deformation of the model under different loadings. These provide insights into the application and usefulness of geometric morphometric methods in interpreting the results of finite element analyses. With further mathematical, engineering and statistical development the combination of FEA and GMM should open up new avenues of investigation of skeletal form and function in evolutionary biology.","Armadillo femur; Finite elements analysis; Geometric morphometrics","Armadillo",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876222020

Because the growth of the craniofacial skeleton is strongly influenced by mechanical functioning, these methods have potential in investigating the normal and abnormal development of the skull: loading history during development can be predicted and bony adaptations to these loads simulated. Thus these methods can be used to predict the impact of altered loading or modifications of skull form early in ontogeny on the subsequent development of structures. Combining functional models with geometric morphometric methods (GMM), which are principally concerned with the study of variations of form, offers the opportunity to examine variations in form during development and the covariations between form and factors such as functional performance. Such a combination of functional models and GMM can potentially be applied in many useful ways, for example: to build and modify functional models, to assess the outcomes of remodelling studies by comparing the results with morphological changes during ontogeny, and to compare the outcomes of finite element analyses within a multivariate framework. Studies using these tools can not only investigate the development of the skull but also the mechanical processes and thus to some degree, behaviours underlying the development of variation among extant and fossil skeletal elements. By bringing together these tools from quite different comparative traditions, a novel and potentially powerful framework for simulation and statistical biomechanical analyses of form and function emerges.

Some studies have modelled trabecular networks in isolation. One study has modelled the performance of whole human bones incorporating trabeculae, although this required considerable computer resources and purpose-written code. The difference between mechanical behaviour in models that incorporate trabecular geometry and non-porous models has not been explored. The ability to easily model trabecular networks may shed light on the mechanical consequences of bone loss in osteoporosis and remodelling after implant insertion. Here we present a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a human ankle bone that includes trabecular network geometry. We compare results from this model with results from non-porous models and introduce protocols achievable on desktop computers using widely available softwares. Our findings show that models including trabecular geometry are considerably stiffer than non-porous whole bone models wherein the non-cortical component has the same mass as the trabecular network, suggesting inclusion of trabecular geometry is desirable. We further present new methods for the construction and analysis of 3D models permitting: (1) construction of multi-property, non-porous models wherein cortical layer thickness can be manipulated; (2) maintenance of the same triangle network for the outer cortical bone surface in both 3D reconstruction and non-porous models allowing exact replication of load and restraint cases; and (3) creation of an internal landmark point grid allowing direct comparison between 3D FE Models (FEMs). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","3D reconstruction; Finite element analysis; Micro CT; Modelling; Talus; Trabecular network","3D models; 3D reconstruction; Bone loss; Computer resources; Cortical bone; Cortical layers; FE model; Finite Element; Human bones; Mechanical behaviour; Mechanical performance; Micro CT; Point grids; Talus; Trabecular networks; Bone; Finite element method; Geometry; Models; Personal computers; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional; anatomic landmark; ankle; article; biomechanics; bone stress; computer model; computer program; cortical bone; finite element analysis; geometry; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; priority journal; rigidity; talus; trabecular bone; Adult; Ankle Joint; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Microcomputers; Models, Biological; Porosity; Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871463168

However, mechanical analyses of primate crania using experimental or modeling methods typically encounter logistical constraints that force them to rely on data gathered from only one or a few individuals. This results in a lack of knowledge concerning the mechanical significance of intraspecific shape variation that limits our ability to infer the significance of interspecific differences. This study uses geometric morphometric methods (GM) and finite element analysis (FEA) to examine the biomechanical implications of shape variation in chimpanzee crania, thereby providing a comparative context in which to interpret shape-related mechanical variation between hominin species. Six finite element models (FEMs) of chimpanzee crania were constructed from CT scans following shape-space Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of a matrix of 709 Procrustes coordinates (digitized onto 21 specimens) to identify the individuals at the extremes of the first three principal components. The FEMs were assigned the material properties of bone and were loaded and constrained to simulate maximal bites on the P3 and M2. Resulting strains indicate that intraspecific cranial variation in morphology is associated with quantitatively high levels of variation in strain magnitudes, but qualitatively little variation in the distribution of strain concentrations. Thus, interspecific comparisons should include considerations of the spatial patterning of strains rather than focus only on their magnitudes.

In southern France this cereal is common in carbonized contexts such as cultural layers, ditches, pits, hearths, etc. The distinction between the two subspecies, two-rowed (. Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L.) and six-rowed barley (. H.vulgare subsp. vulgare L.) is usually based on morphological characters. The following criteria can be used to discriminate both subspecies from archaeological remains: the number of fertile spikelets per rachis segments, the linear or horseshoe shape depression of the lemma base, the maximum width of the caryopses and the proportion of twisted grains. The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for two-rowed barley is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of two-rowed barley in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1st to the 11th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Archaeobotany; Cereal grains; Experimental charring; Identification; Medieval period; Roman period","agricultural history; archaeological evidence; archaeology; barley; cultivation; experimental study; identification method; Medieval; morphometry; Roman era; agriculture; botany; cereal; France; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886302631

However, because of the added complexity they introduce, sutures are rarely included in finite element (FE) models, despite their potential to influence strain results. Because sutures present different morphologies and with differing degrees of internal fusion, many different methods of modeling may be necessary to accurately measure strain environments. Alternatively, these variables may exert very little influence on the scale of a whole-skull model. To validate suture modeling methods, four alternative ways of including a suture in 3D FE models of the pig zygomatic arch were considered and compared with ex vivo experimental data from digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI). The use of DSPI rather than traditional strain gauge techniques allows strain gradients around the suture as well as the motions of the two bones to be observed. Results show that the introduction of 3D elements assigned more compliant material properties than the surrounding bone, is the most effective way of modeling both morphologies of suture, both in tension and compression. However, models containing no suture are almost indistinguishable from these compliant suture models, beyond the high strain gradient immediately adjacent to the suture. Conversely, modeling the suture as an open break in the mesh, or with spring elements assigned suture properties, fails to reproduce the experiment. Thus, although a solid but flexible model of sutures is preferred, the similarity between these models and those without sutures tentatively suggests that such extra detail may be unnecessary in pigs if the behavior of the whole skull is of interest. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","DSPI; Finite element analysis; Strain; Sutures; Validation","animal; article; biological model; biomechanics; comparative study; cranial suture; finite element analysis; interferometry; mechanical stress; physiology; skull; swine; validation study; zygoma; Animals; Biomechanics; Cranial Sutures; Finite Element Analysis; Interferometry; Models, Biological; Skull; Stress, Mechanical; Swine; Zygoma; Mammalia; Suidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054030615

In the case of the cranium this approach has been applied to both living and fossil taxa to (for example) investigate how form relates to function or infer diet or behaviour. However, FE models of complex musculoskeletal structures always rely on simplified representations because it is impossible completely to image and represent every detail of skeletal morphology, variations in material properties and the complexities of loading at all spatial and temporal scales. The effects of necessary simplifications merit investigation. To this end, this study focuses on one aspect, model geometry, which is particularly pertinent to fossil material where taphonomic processes often destroy the finer details of anatomy or in models built from clinical CTs where the resolution is limited and anatomical details are lost. We manipulated the details of a finite element (FE) model of an adult human male cranium and examined the impact on model performance. First, using digital speckle interferometry, we directly measured strains from the infraorbital region and frontal process of the maxilla of the physical cranium under simplified loading conditions, simulating incisor biting. These measured strains were then compared with predicted values from FE models with simplified geometries that included modifications to model resolution, and how cancellous bone and the thin bones of the circum-nasal and maxillary regions were represented. Distributions of regions of relatively high and low principal strains and principal strain vector magnitudes and directions, predicted by the most detailed FE model, are generally similar to those achieved in vitro. Representing cancellous bone as solid cortical bone lowers strain magnitudes substantially but the mode of deformation of the FE model is relatively constant. In contrast, omitting thin plates of bone in the circum-nasal region affects both mode and magnitude of deformation. Our findings provide a useful frame of reference with regard to the effects of simplifications on the performance of FE models of the cranium and call for caution in the interpretation and comparison of FEA results. © 2016 Anatomical Society.","Digital speckle interferometry; Finite element analysis; Finite element model validation; Human cranium","aged; animal; biological model; biomechanics; cadaver; facial bone; finite element analysis; human; incisor; interferometry; male; mastication; maxilla; mechanical stress; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Aged; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bite Force; Cadaver; Facial Bones; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Incisor; Interferometry; Male; Maxilla; Models, Biological; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955191156

Among these, morphometric quantitative techniques for reconstruction are increasingly common. Here we compare the accuracy of three approaches - mean substitution, thin plate splines, and multiple linear regression - for estimating missing landmarks of damaged fossil specimens. Comparisons are made varying the number of missing landmarks, sample sizes, and the reference species of the population used to perform the estimation. The testing is performed on landmark data from individuals of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla, and nine hominin fossil specimens. Results suggest that when a small, same-species fossil reference sample is available to guide reconstructions, thin plate spline approaches perform best. However, if no such sample is available (or if the species of the damaged individual is uncertain), estimates of missing morphology based on a single individual (or even a small sample) of close taxonomic affinity are less accurate than those based on a large sample of individuals drawn from more distantly related extant populations using a technique (such as a regression method) able to leverage the information (e.g., variation/covariation patterning) contained in this large sample. Thin plate splines also show an unexpectedly large amount of error in estimating landmarks, especially over large areas.

One major issue however with musculoskeletal analyses is that of muscle activation pattern indeterminacy. A very large number of possible muscle force combinations will satisfy a particular functional task. This makes predicting physiological muscle recruitment patterns difficult. Here we describe in detail the process of development of a complex multibody computer model of a primate skull (Macaca fascicularis), that aims to predict muscle recruitment patterns during biting. Using optimisation criteria based on minimisation of muscle stress we predict working to balancing side muscle force ratios, peak bite forces, and joint reaction forces during unilateral biting. Validation of such models is problematic; however we have shown comparable working to balancing muscle activity and TMJ reaction ratios during biting to those observed in vivo and that peak predicted bite forces compare well to published experimental data. To our knowledge the complexity of the musculoskeletal model is greater than any previously reported for a primate. This complexity, when compared to more simple representations provides more nuanced insights into the functioning of masticatory muscles. Thus, we have shown muscle activity to vary throughout individual muscle groups, which enables them to function optimally during specific masticatory tasks.

Here, we consider scaling of xenarthrans, particularly how femoral form and function varies to accommodate the size range between the 3 kg armadillo and its giant relative the 300 kg glyptodont. It has already been noted that femoral morphology differs between these animals and suggested that this reflects a novel adaptation to size increase in glyptodont. We test this idea by applying a finite element analysis of coronal plane forces to femoral models of these animals, simulating the stance phase in the hind limb; where the femur is subject to bending owing to longitudinal compressive as well as abduction loads on the greater trochanter. We use these models to examine the hypothesis that muscles attaching on the third trochanter (T3) can reduce this bending in the loaded femur and that the T3 forces are more effective at reducing bending in glyptodont where the T3 is situated at the level of the knee. The analysis uses traditional finite element methods to produce strain maps and examine strains at 200 points on the femur. The coordinates of these points before and after loading are also used to carry out geometric morphometric (GM) analyses of the gross deformation of the model in different loading scenarios. The results show that longitudinal compressive and abductor muscle loading increases bending in the coronal plane, and that loads applied to the T3 reduce that bending. In the glyptodont model, the T3 loads are more effective and can more readily compensate for the bending owing to longitudinal and abductor loads. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of GM methods in interpreting the results of finite element analyses. © 2012 The Royal Society.","Armadillo; Finite element analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Glyptodont femur; Third trochanter; Xenarthran","animal; body mass; body size; bone; finite element method; geometry; hypothesis testing; morphology; morphometry; muscle; Animalia; Armadillo",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864363673

Except for the recently extinct thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), most are known from fragmentary craniodental material only, limiting the scope of biomechanical and ecological studies. However, a particularly well-preserved skull of the fossil species Nimbacinus dicksoni, has been recovered from middle Miocene (∼16-11.6 Ma) deposits in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland. Here, we ask whether N. dicksoni was more similar to its recently extinct relative or to several large living marsupials in a key aspect of feeding ecology, i.e., was N. dicksoni a relatively small or large prey specialist. To address this question we have digitally reconstructed its skull and applied three-dimensional Finite Element Analysis to compare its mechanical performance with that of three extant marsupial carnivores and T. cynocephalus. Under loadings adjusted for differences in size that simulated forces generated by both jaw closing musculature and struggling prey, we found that stress distributions and magnitudes in the skull of N. dicksoni were more similar to those of the living spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) than to its recently extinct relative. Considering the Finite Element Analysis results and dental morphology, we predict that N. dicksoni likely occupied a broadly similar ecological niche to that of D. maculatus, and was likely capable of hunting vertebrate prey that may have exceeded its own body mass. © 2014 Attard et al.",,"adult; animal hunting; animal tissue; article; biomechanics; body mass; body size; carnivore; Cenozoic; controlled study; Dasyurus maculatus; ecological niche; extant species; extinct species; feeding ecology; female; finite element analysis; image reconstruction; jaw muscle; male; marsupial; Nimbacinus dicksoni; nonhuman; prey; skull; species difference; three dimensional imaging; Thylacinus cynocephalus; tooth size; animal; body weight; image processing; marsupial; mastication; mechanical stress; muscle; physiology; predation; principal component analysis; time; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Body Size; Body Weight; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Marsupialia; Mastication; Muscles; Predatory Behavior; Principal Component Analysis; Stress, Mechanical; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899540128

Characterization of the biomechanics of the CFS is challenging due to its highly complex structure and heterogeneity, motivating the utilization of experimentally validated computational models. As such, the objective of this study was to develop, experimentally validate, and parametrically analyse a patient-specific finite element (FE) model of the CFS to elucidate a better understanding of the factors that are of intrinsic importance to the skeletal structural behaviour of the human CFS. An FE model of a cadaveric craniofacial skeleton was created from subject-specific computed tomography data. The model was validated based on bone strain measurements taken under simulated physiological-like loading through the masseter and temporalis muscles (which are responsible for the majority of craniofacial physiologic loading due to mastication). The baseline subject-specific model using locally defined cortical bone thicknesses produced the strongest correlation to the experimental data (r2=0.73). Large effects on strain patterns arising from small parametric changes in cortical thickness suggest that the very thin bony structures present in the CFS are crucial to characterizing the local load distribution in the CFS accurately. © Authors 2011.","computed tomography; experimental validation; human craniofacial skeleton; sensitivity analysis; subject-specific finite element model","Bony structures; Complex structure; Computational model; Computed Tomography; Computed tomography data; Cortical bone; Cortical thickness; Craniofacial; Craniofacial skeleton; Experimental data; experimental validation; FE model; human craniofacial skeleton; Local loads; Mechanical response; Parametric changes; Physiologic loadings; Physiological loads; Specific finite element; Strain patterns; Structural behaviour; Subject-specific; subject-specific finite element model; Temporalis; Traumatic injury; Behavioral research; Biomechanics; Bone; Computer simulation; Computerized tomography; Diagnostic products; Physiological models; Physiology; Sensitivity analysis; Finite element method; article; audiovisual equipment; biological model; biomechanics; biomedical engineering; cadaver; computer simulation; facial bone; female; finite element analysis; histology; human; in vitro study; middle aged; physiology; skull; validation study; Biomechanics; Biomedical Engineering; Cadaver; Computer Simulation; Facial Bones; Female; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Middle Aged; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551666486

In this study, finite element analysis was used to estimate the maximum bite force that J. monesi could generate at the incisors and the cheek teeth. Owing to uncertainty in the model inputs, a sensitivity study was conducted in which the muscle forces and orientations were sequentially altered. This enabled conclusions to be drawn on the function of some of the masticatory muscles. It was found that J. monesi had a bite of 1389 N at the incisors, rising to 4165 N at the third molar. Varying muscle forces by 20% and orientations by 10° around the medio-lateral aspect led to an error in bite force of under 35% at each tooth. Predicted stresses across the skull were only minimally affected by changes to muscle forces and orientations, but revealed a reasonable safety factor in the strength of the skull.

Here we characterize the association between genetic ancestry and individual asymmetry on a sample of Latin-American admixed populations. To do so, three-dimensional (3D) facial shape attributes were explored on a sample of 4,104 volunteers aged between 18 and 85 years. Individual ancestry and heterozygosity was estimated using more than 730,000 genome-wide markers. Multivariate techniques applied to geometric morphometric data were used to evaluate the magnitude and significance of directional and fluctuating asymmetry (FA), as well as correlations and multiple regressions aimed to estimate the relationship between facial FA scores and heterozygosity and a set of covariates. Results indicate that directional and FA are both significant, the former being the strongest expression of asymmetry in this sample. In addition, our analyses suggest that there are some specific patterns of facial asymmetries characterizing the different ancestry groups. Finally, we find that more heterozygous individuals exhibit lower levels of asymmetry. Our results highlight the importance of including ancestry-admixture estimators, especially when the analyses are aimed to compare levels of asymmetries on groups differing on socioeconomic levels, as a proxy to estimate developmental noise.

The present work seeks to fill this gap, using as a case study a corpus of 154 complete ceramic vessels from the Bibracte oppidum (France), the capital of the Celtic tribe Aedui from the Second Iron Age. Two outline-based approaches were selected: the Elliptic Fourier Analysis and the Discrete Cosine Transform. They were combined with numerous methods of standardisation/normalisation. Although standardisations may use either perimeter or surface, the resulting morphospaces remain comparable, and, interestingly, are also comparable with the morphospace built from traditional typology. Geometric morphometrics also presentthe advantage of being easily implemented and automated for large sets of artefacts. The method is reproducible and provides quantitative estimates, such as mean shape, and shape diversity of ceramic assemblages, allowing objective inferences to be statistically tested. The approach can easily be generalised and adopted for other kinds of artefacts, to study the level of production standardisation and the evolution of shape over space and time, and to provide information about material and cultural exchanges. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeology; Bibracte; Closed contour; Discrete cosine transform; Elliptic fourier analysis; Open contour; Pottery; Type","archaeology; artifact; ceramics; Iron Age; morphometry; Fourier transform; geometry; standardization; strength; typology; France",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904340280

Missing data can be estimated by geometric morphometrics using information from complete specimens, for example, by using thin-plate splines. In this study, we estimate missing data in several virtually fragmented models of hominoid crania (Homo, Pan, Pongo) and fossil hominins (e.g., Australopithecus africanus, Homo heidelbergensis). The aim is to investigate in which way different references influence estimations of cranial shape and how this information can be employed in the reconstruction of fossils. We used a sample of 64 three-dimensional digital models of complete human, chimpanzee, and orangutan crania and a set of 758 landmarks and semilandmarks. The virtually knocked out neurocranial and facial areas that were reconstructed corresponded to those of a real case found in A.L. 444-2 (A. afarensis) cranium. Accuracy of multiple intraspecies and interspecies reconstructions was computed as the maximum square root of the mean squared difference between the original and the reconstruction (root mean square). The results show that the uncertainty in reconstructions is a function of both the geometry of the knockout area and the dissimilarity between the reference sample and the specimen(s) undergoing reconstruction. We suggest that it is possible to estimate large missing cranial areas if the shape of the reference is similar enough to the shape of the specimen reconstructed, though caution must be exercised when employing these reconstructions in subsequent analyses. We provide a potential guide for the choice of the reference by means of bending energy. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Fossils; Geometric morphometrics; Reference-based reconstruction; Thin-plate spline; Virtual reconstruction","accuracy; anatomic landmark; ape; Article; chimpanzee; energy; female; fossil; fossil hominin; fossil hominoid; geometry; human; information; male; nonhuman; orang utan; priority journal; skull; anatomy and histology; animal; face; hominid; orangutan; Pan troglodytes; physical anthropology; skull; Australopithecus africanus; Crania; Hominoidea; Homo heidelbergensis; Pan; Pongo; Pongo pygmaeus; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Face; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Pan troglodytes; Pongo; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927972960

P. Beauv. (foxtail millet) was originally domesticated in northern China. The time and route of its introduction into South Asia is currently unclear due to the possible confusion with autochthonous Brachiaria ramosa (L.) Stapf. (browntop millet). Geometric morphometrics (GM) offer an alternative to traditional archaeobotanical methods to distinguish between these two small millet species. This study aims at finding a method to securely distinguish among charred caryopses of S. italica and B. ramosa, testing its validity on archaeobotanical assemblages and proposing a new approach for studying the dispersion of S. italica throughout Eurasia. Modern S. italica (n = 35) and B. ramosa (n = 34) caryopses and 15 archaeological specimens from a 5th millennium bp archaeological occupation site in northwestern India were analysed. Archaeological and modern caryopses (before and after charring) were photographed with a Leica EZ4D stereoscope, and TPSdig software was used to scale the photographs and manually apply a configuration of three landmarks and six semi-landmarks onto the contours of the embryos. Multivariate statistics were carried out to analyse the shape differences between modern S. italica and B. ramosa and to classify the archaeological specimens. The results show that the shape of the embryo of both species can be clearly distinguished using a GM-approach, both before and after charring. However, charring tends to smooth the shape differences between the two groups, which may affect the interpretation of archaeobotanical assemblages. The comparison between modern and archaeological caryopses suggests that S. italica was not present in northwestern India during the 5th millennium bp. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Archaeobotany; Crop dispersal; Geometric morphometrics; Identification criteria; Shape analysis; Small millets",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937149140

In contrast to African apes, Pongo is characterized by a structural condition known as airorhynchy, an upwardly rotated face relative to the basicranium. In this study we investigated patterns of covariation between facial orientation and basicranial and orbital shape. The sample comprised 43 adult specimens of Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus. The shape of the craniofacial complex is represented by 105 three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks digitized on images obtained with computed tomography (CT). We investigated covariation patterns and facial orientation using partial least squares analysis of basicranial and orbital shape vis-à-vis maxillary shape. We found strong integration between the shape of the cranial base, orbits, and the shape and orientation of the palate and premaxilla. Facial orientation in our sample is also highly variable. As a dorsally rotated palate is associated with a ventral rotation of the orbits but not with a reduced basicranial angle, the “facial block” hypothesis cannot explain the variation in facial orientation in Pongo. Our results also indicate that mature males have a more ventrally oriented lower face that may be due to a reconfiguration of the craniofacial complex during the extended male growth phase. These findings demonstrate that there is strong integration between the cranial base and face and a high degree of variation in facial orientation in Pongo. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Airorhynchy; Bornean orangutan; Facial orientation; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological integration; Partial least squares","adult; cranium; digitization; geometry; hominid; image analysis; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; morphology; morphometry; regression analysis; shape; tomography; Africa; Homo; Pongo; Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937974854

Force magnitude estimation from directly measured muscle physiological cross-sectional area or anatomical cross-sectional area (CSA) is not possible for fossils and skeletal material from museum collections. In these cases, muscle CSAs are often estimated from bony features. This approach has been shown to be inaccurate in a prior study based on direct measurements from cadavers. Postmortem alterations as well as age changes in muscle form might explain this discrepancy. As such, the present study uses CT images from 20 living individuals to directly measure temporalis and masseter muscle CSAs and estimated cross-sectional areas (ECSAs) from bony features. The relationships between CSAs and ECSAs were assessed by comparing mean values and by examining correlations. ECSAs are up to 100% greater than CSA and the means of these variables for each muscle differ significantly. Further, ECSA is significantly correlated with CSA for temporalis but not masseter. Cranial centroid size is only significantly associated with CSA for temporalis. These findings indicate that ECSAs should be employed with caution in simulations of human masticatory system functioning; they do not reflect CSAs and it is plausible that this also applies to studies of closely related living and fossil taxa. When ECSAs are used, sensitivity analyses are required to determine the impact of potential errors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Computed tomography; Dry skull method of muscle area estimation; Muscle cross-sectional area; Skull size","adult; aged; Article; computer assisted tomography; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; masseter muscle; masticatory muscle; morphology; muscle strength; postmortem change; priority journal; skull; temporalis muscle; anatomy; anatomy and histology; masseter muscle; mastication; middle aged; radiography; skull; temporalis muscle; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anatomy, Cross-Sectional; Bite Force; Female; Humans; Male; Masseter Muscle; Middle Aged; Skull; Temporal Muscle",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931574738

T2N 1N4, Canada","Developing theories of vernacular architecture in archaeology has been hindered by the lack of a defined methodology for studying ancient buildings, and the absence of information on the mechanical properties of construction materials uncommon in today's building practices. In this paper we use Finite Element Methods and recent research on the structural properties of whalebone to analyze the architecture of Thule semi-subterranean houses. These unique dwellings were constructed and used by the ancestors of Inuit/Eskimo peoples in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland. Little is known about how they were designed and constructed because few have ever been discovered intact. The substantial weight of whalebone roof frames suggests that some designs would have performed better than others. Poorly planned houses, or the use of whalebone in a symbolic rather than strictly utilitarian capacity, may have resulted in higher maintenance costs, thereby shortening their anticipated use life. In extreme cases, errors in design, or the failure of materials may have caused dwellings to collapse, resulting in injuries or possibly even death. We demonstrate through this case study that Finite Element Methods constitutes an effective methodology for studying ancient buildings, with the proviso that more research is needed on the mechanical properties of building materials used in the past. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
