As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

Most of this change has been due to the development and adoption of methods to analyze the Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks. These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption. We consider the implications of these findings in terms of the potential for these approaches in the study of comparative growth in related species.","Facial remodelling; Geometric morphometrics; Thin plate spline analysis","age; allometry; article; cercocebus; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; face growth; female; geometry; male; molar tooth; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; sex difference; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Anthropometry; Bone Remodeling; Cercocebus; Facial Bones; Female; Male; Models, Anatomic; Sex Characteristics; Cercocebus; Cercocebus torquatus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031724058

Although cladistically derived trees are only hypotheses about phylogeny, they are superior both to trees created through phenetics, which employs characters without regard as to whether they are analogous or homologous, and to trees created by using undifferentiated homologous characters. To date, cladistics is an unused approach to constructing archaeological phylogenies but one that holds considerable potential for resolving some of archaeology’s historical problems. For example, it has long been noted that the southeastern United States exhibits the greatest diversity in fluted-point forms in North America-an observation that prompted Mason (1962) to propose that fluted points originated in the Southeast and then spread to other areas. However, because of a paucity of such points from well-dated contexts in the Southeast, it is difficult to ascertain chronological, let alone phylogenetic, relations among the various forms.

Initial attempts at dating were based on correlation with extinct fauna, the ""geologic-climatic"" dating method, and stratigraphic relationships of artifacts within sites. By the time radiocarbon dating was developed (1950), the basic Paleoindian sequence (oldest to youngest) was: Clovis-Folsom-unfluted lanceolates (such as Plainview, Eden, and Scottsbluff). Initial applications of radiocarbon dating in the 1950s did little to further resolve age relationships. In the 1960s, however, largely through the efforts of C. V. Haynes, a numerical geochronology of Paleoindian occupations on the Great Plains began to emerge On the Southern Great Plains the radiocarbon-dated artifact chronology is: Clovis (11,600-11,000 yr B.P.); Folsom and Midland (10,900-10,100 yr B.P.); Plainview, Milnesand, and Lubbock (10,200-9800 yr B.P.); Firstview (9400-8200 yr B.P.); St. Mary's Hall, Golondrina, and Texas Angostura (9200-8000 yr B.P.). The chronology for the Northern Great Plains is: Clovis (11,200-10,900 yr B.P.); Goshen (ca. 11,000 yr B.P.); Folsom (10,900-10,200 yr B.P.); Agate Basin (10,500-10,000 yr B.P.); Hell Gap (10,500-9500 yr B.P.); Alberta, Alberta-Cody (10,200-9400 yr B.P.); Cody (Eden-Scottsbluff) (9400-8800 yr B.P.); Angostura, Jimmy Allen, Frederick, and other parallel-oblique types (9400-7800 yr B.P.). Fifty years after the development of radiocarbon dating, the basic typological sequence has not changed significantly except for the realization that there probably was significant temporal overlap of some point types, and that the old unilinear sequence does not account for all the known typological variation. The chronology has been continually refined with the determination of hundreds of radiocarbon ages in recent decades. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346424988

However, form provides the basis for the description of organisms, and the study of fossils crucially depends on morphology. Complex organisms tend to evolve as 'mosaics', in which parts may be modified at varying rates and in response to different selective pressures. Thus, individual anatomical regions may contain different phylogenetic signals. In the present study, we used computerized methods to 'dissect' the skulls of a primate clade, the guenons, into functional and developmental modules (FDM). The potential of different modules as proxies for phylogenetic divergence in modern lineages was investigated. We found that the chondrocranium was the only FDM in which shape consistently had a strong and significant phylogenetic signal. This region might be less susceptible to epigenetic factors and thus more informative about phylogeny. The examination of the topology of trees from the chondrocranium suggested that the main differences evolved at the time of the radiation of terrestrial and arboreal guenons. However, phylogenetic reconstructions were found to be strongly affected by sampling error, with more localized anatomical regions (i.e. smaller/less complex FDMs) generally producing less reproducible tree topologies. This finding, if confirmed in other groups, implies that the utility of specific FDMs for phylogenetic inference could, in many cases, be hampered by the low reproducibility of results. The study also suggested that uncertainties due to sampling error may be larger than those from character sampling. This might have implications for phylogenetic analyses, which typically provide estimates of support of tree nodes based on characters but do not generally take into account the effect of sampling error on the tree topology. Nonetheless, studies of the potential of different FDMs as proxies for phylogenetic divergence in modern lineages, such as the present study, provide a framework that may help in modelling the morphological evolution of present and fossil species. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.","Cercopithecini; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological evolution; Reliability and reproducibility; Skull modules","cranium; divergence; evolution; fossil; morphology; morphometry; phylogenetics; primate; signal; skull; species complex; topology; Animalia; Cercopithecini; Primates",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-40749104643

There is widespread agreement that Clovis and related cultures of the Early Paleoindian period (∼11,500-10,500 BP) represent the first well-documented indications of human occupation, but considerable differences of opinion exist regarding the origins of these cultures. Here, we report the results of a study in which data from a continent-wide sample of Early Paleoindian projectile points were analyzed with cladistic methods in order to assess competing models of colonization as well as several alternative explanations for the variation among the points, including adaptation to local environmental circumstances, cultural diffusion, and site type effects. The analyses suggest that a rapidly migrating population produced the Early Paleoindian projectile point assemblages. They also suggest that the population in question is unlikely to have entered North America from either the Isthmus of Panama or the Midatlantic region. According to the analyses, the Early Paleoindians are more likely to have entered North America via either the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that is hypothesized to have opened around 12,000 BP, or the Northwest Coast. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The experiments use the isotropic error model, which assumes equal and independent variation at each landmark. The case of three landmarks in the plane (i.e., triangles) was emphasized because it could be investigated systematically and the results displayed on the printed page. The amount of error in the estimates was displayed as RMSE surfaces over the space of all possible configurations of three landmarks. Patterns of bias were shown as vector fields over this same space. Experiments were also performed using particular combinations of four or more landmarks in both two and three dimensions. It was found that the generalized Procrustes analysis method produced estimates with the least error and no pattern of bias. Averages of Bookstein shape coordinates performed well if the longest edge was used as the baseline. The method of moments (Stoyan, 1990, Model. Biomet. J. 32, 843) used in EDMA (Lele, 1993, Math. Geol. 25, 573) exhibits larger errors. When variation is not small, it also shows a pattern of bias for isosceles triangles with one side much shorter than the other two and for triangles whose vertices are approximately collinear causing them to resemble their own reflections.

This phylogeny differs from morphological phylogenies regarding the relationships of the mangabeys (Cercocebus and Lophocebus) and baboons (Mandrillus, Papio, and Theropithecus). Under the likely assumption that the molecular estimate is correct, the incongruence between the molecular and morphological data sets indicates that the latter include numerous homoplasies. Knowledge of how these homoplasies emerge through development is important for understanding the morphological evolution of the living papionins, and also for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships and adaptations of their fossil relatives. Accordingly, we have used geometric morphometric techniques and the molecular phylogeny to investigate the ontogeny of a key area of morphological homoplasy in papionins, the face. Two analyses were carried out. The first compared allometric vectors of Cercocebus, Lophocebus, Macaca, Mandrillus, and Papio to determine which of the facial resemblances among the genera are homoplasic and which are plesiomorphic. The second analysis focused on early post-natal facial form in order to establish whether the facial homoplasies exhibited by the adult papionins are to some degree present early in the post-natal period or whether they develop only later in ontogeny. The results of our analyses go some way to resolving the debate over which papionin genera display homoplasic facial similarities. They strongly suggest that the homoplasic facial similarities are exhibited by Mandrillus and Papio and not by Cercocebus and Lophocebus, which share the putative primitive state with Macaca. Our results also indicate that Mandrillus and Papio achieve their homoplasic similarities in facial form not through simple extension of the ancestral allometric trajectory but through a combination of an extension of allometry into larger size ranges and a change in direction of allometry away from the ancestral trajectory. Thus, the face of Mandrillus is not simply a hypermorphic version of the face of its sister taxon, Cercocebus, and the face of Papio is not merely a scaled-up version of the face of its sister taxon, Lophocebus. Lastly, our results show that facial homoplasy is not restricted to adult papionins; it is also manifest in infant and juvenile papionins. This suggests that the homoplasic facial similarities between Mandrillus and Papio are unlikely to be a result of sexual selection.",,"homoplasy; ontogeny; phylogeny; primate; animal; article; classification; evolution; face; female; genetics; histology; male; molecular evolution; papio; phylogeny; skull; Animals; Classification; Evolution; Evolution, Molecular; Face; Female; Male; Papio; Phylogeny; Skull; Animalia; Cercocebus; Lophocebus; Macaca; Mandrillus; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Primates; Theropithecus; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034768466

Hence, this hypothesis is based on the assumption that similarities between Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores can be interpreted as being phylogenetically homologous (i.e. due to common technological ancestry) as opposed to being homoplasic (i.e. due to convergent technological evolution). Here, the phylogenetic basis of this hypothesis is tested using a formal cladistic procedure. Under the framework of an 'iterative' approach to phylogenetic analysis, a series of post-hoc tests and re-evaluations of results follow the initial cladistic analysis. Results of these combined analyses indicate that morphological similarities between Mode 2 Acheulean handaxes and Mode 3 Levallois cores can, most parsimoniously, be seen as phylogenetically homologous. Hence, these results support the tenets of the 'Movius-Schick' hypothesis in suggesting that a lack of Levallois industries in East Asia may be due to the paucity of an ancestral Acheulean tradition in that region. The implications of these phylogenetic analyses for the concept of Palaeolithic 'Modes' are discussed. It is further suggested that low demographic levels (i.e. small effective population sizes) in East Asia may have constrained the technological phylogenetic trajectory of East Asia compared with that seen in other regions of the Old World during the Lower Palaeolithic. In addition, it is hoped that several methodological issues discussed here will contribute to the growing field of cultural phylogenetic analysis. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A few previous, scattered stratigraphic investigations of the draws strongly suggested synchroneity in late Quaternary depositional and soil-forming events and regionwide environmental changes. This volume reports on a systematic study conducted from 1988 to 1992 aimed at better documenting the late Quaternary geomorphic evolution and stratigraphic record of the draws, investigating their paleoenvironmental significance, and determining whether there were synchronous, regional, geomorphic, and soil-forming events in these dry valleys. The work focused on the past 12,000 years because most of the valley fill dates to this time, but older deposits occur locally and were investigated as well. Most of the research was in Running Water, Blackwater, and Yellowhouse Draws (tributaries of the Brazos River), and Sulphur and Mustang Draws (tributaries of the Colorado River), with additional coring on McKenzie, Seminole, Monument, Monahans, and Midland Draws (all tributaries of the Colorado). Approximately 410 cores and exposures at 110 localities were studied. Samples collected from these sections underwent a variety of sedimentological and pedological analyses. Age control is provided by 53 new radiocarbon ages and scores of ages already available from several archaeological sites. Efforts also were made to recover pollen, phytoliths, molluscs, insects, ostracodes, and vertebrate faunal remains, and stable-carbon isotope trends were determined for four sites. Several geomorphic processes and features exerted some influence on late Quaternary drainage development. Quaternary jointing and subsidence controlled drainage patterns around the margins of the Southern High Plains, particularly on the northern edge (Red River system). Major segments of most draws roughly parallel paleodrainages on the buried Tertiary erosion surface. Factors influencing the older drainage likely influenced development of the present drainage. Segments of Running Water, Blackwater, and Sulphur Draws also probably follow ancient drainageways that once connected the plains with the mountains to the west. Most of the draws intersect paleolake basins or extant lake bains, which may have exerted control on drainage development by directing water to paleotopographic lows or by overtopping and interconnection of basins. The last phase of incision by the draws began after 20,000 yr B.P. but before 12,000 yr B.P. and aggradation began ca. 12,000 yr B.P. Valley fill predating this final incision is common locally and includes alluvial sand and gravel (stratum A) and lacustrine carbonate (stratum B). Eolian sheet sand with strong pedogenic modification (stratum C) accumulated on the uplands adjacent to some reaches during valley aggradation. After ca. 12,000 yr B.P. the draws filled with a variety of sediments but produced a similar stratigraphic sequence among all of the drainages. Five principal lithostratigraphic units were identified: strata 1-5, oldest to youngest. Sandy and gravelly alluvium (stratum 1) is the oldest fill postdating final incision. There were several cycles of alluviation contemporaneous with or following the downcutting. The beginning of stratum 1 deposition is undated, but the top of stratum 1 ranges in age, with a few exceptions, from ca. 11,000 to ca. 9,500 yr B.P. Stratum 2 contains beds of diatomaceous mud and noncalcareous or low-carbonate paludal mud conformably overlying stratum 1. Valley-margin facies of eolian and slopewash sands are common locally. A weakly developed soil formed at the top of stratum 2. These deposits are well known for containing extinct vertebrates and Paleoindian archaeological materials. Stratum 2 is quite rare, however. Of the >100 study localities only 12 yielded stratum 2. Beginning of stratum 2 deposition varied from ca. 11,000-ca. 10,000 yr B.P., and the end of deposition ranged from ca. 10,000-ca. 8,500 yr B.P. Stratum 3 is a marl deposited by precipitation in marshes or shallow ponds along the valley axes. Locally the marl has a sandy, relatively low carbonate eolian facies along valley margins. A weakly developed soil formed at the top of stratum 3 (Yellowhouse soil). Most stratum 3 deposition occurred between ca. 10,000 and ca. 7,500 yr B.P., but both the beginning and end of deposition was time transgressive. Stratum 4 is a thick (1-3 m), loamy to sandy, eolian layer. A moderately to strongly developed soil (Lubbock Lake soil: ochric or mollic A horizon over argillic and calcic Bt or Btk horizons) formed in stratum 4 and usually is the surface soil along the draws. Stratum 4 generally dates to ca. 7,500-4,500 yr B.P. The Lubbock Lake soil developed throughout the rest of the Holocene, except where buried by stratum 5. Stratum 5 includes localized accumulations of late Holocene paludal mud (beginning 3,900 yr B.P.) and slope wash and eolian sediment (beginning 3,000 yr B.P.). The late Quaternary fill in the draws provides evidence of significant environmental change. From the latest Pleistocene to the early Holocene there was a hydrologic shift from flowing water (deposition of stratum 1) to standing water (deposition of strata 2 and/or 3), then almost complete disappearance of surface water and the accumulation of eolian sediment (stratum 4). Very broadly, the shifts in depositional environment were time transgressive (younger down draw). These environmental changes resulted from a decrease in effective regional precipitation from the late Pleistocene to the middle Holocene. In the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, local variability in the types and ages of the deposits was controlled by the presence or absence of springs and by time-transgressive decline in spring discharge. The early to middle Holocene eolian fill resulted from desiccation and wind deflation of the High Plains surface. By about 4,500 yr B.P., effective precipitation increased and vegetation became more dense, denoting establishment of the modern environment. There were brief climatic departures toward aridity in the late Holocene.",,"Carbonation; Catchments; Deposits; Fertilizers; Lakes; Mining laws and regulations; Rivers; Sediments; Soils; Stratigraphy; Sulfur; Water; Archaeological materials; Depositional environment; Environmental change; Geomorphic evolution; Lithostratigraphic units; Stable carbon isotopes; Stratigraphic records; Stratigraphic sequences; Landforms; geomorphological response; paleoenvironment; Quaternary; sequence stratigraphy; upland region; valley; Colorado River [North America]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842557560

A newly developed digitizing method is used to capture 12 interlandmark characters from coordinate data to describe point form. Principal components analysis is used to investigate size and shape variation in point form, and the symmetry and allometry of characters are used to explore the effects of resharpening on point dimensions. Size allometry illustrates the degree of association of relative point proportions, and other aspects of point form, with point size. Blade length, the leading edge of the weapon, was found to be isometric with point size, suggesting that this character was critical to the proper functioning of weapon tips. The regulation of blade length to point size supports a fixed-in-haft model for Folsom point resharpening. Multivariate analyses show that reduction in point forms do not correlate with distance-to-source but are more consistent with the model of the cyclical resharpening and replacement of points. This research illustrates that multivariate and allometric analyses are useful methods for investigating models of technological organization and the effects of resharpening on point form. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, some studies have indicated that facial sexual dimorphism arises through ontogenetic scaling, whereas others have found it to be a consequence of both ontogenetic scaling and divergence in male and female growth trajectories. To shed further light on primate facial sexual dimorphism, geometric morphometric methods were applied to crania representing five papionin genera: Cercocebus, Lophocebus, Macaca, Mandrillus and Papio. A first set of analyses focused on the pattern and degree of facial sexual dimorphism exhibited by adult specimens. A second set of analyses concentrated on the ontogeny of facial sexual dimorphism in infant-to-adult age series. The first set indicated that the five genera exhibit significant facial sexual dimorphism. These analyses also revealed that the genera share several features of sexual dimorphism. Males are distinguished from females in having a more prognathic mid-face, a relatively more inferiorly and anteriorly positioned prosthion, relatively increased subnasal height and relatively broader zygomatic roots. They are also differentiated from females in their maxillae, which relative to the zygomatics are narrow but vertically deep, especially in the posterior aspect. Also, the first set of analyses indicated that Macaca is the most distinctive of the genera in terms of sexual dimorphism. The distinctive features of the Macaca sexual dimorphism are that males exhibit relatively wider nasal apertures and premaxillae than females, together with a relative increase in breadth across the inferior zygomatic roots. The second set of analyses demonstrated that in all the genera, sexual dimorphism arises partly through ontogenetic scaling and partly through a late divergence in male and female growth trajectories. The analyses also indicated that the relative contribution of these processes to sexual dimorphism varies among the genera. Ontogenetic scaling is by far the most important process in Lophocebus and Papio. Late divergence between male and female growth trajectories contributes proportionately more in Cercocebus and Mandrillus, although ontogenetic scaling still plays the major role. The relative contribution of late divergence between male and female growth trajectories is greatest in Macaca, in which it accounts for about half of the facial differences between adult males and females. In all five genera, ontogenetic scaling results in increased prognathism and greater relative maxillary size in males compared to females, whilst the late divergence involves the male mid-face becoming proportionately larger and deeper than the female mid-face, and the male posterior maxilla coming to lie more inferiorly with respect to the zygomatic root than its female counterpart.","Baboon; Geometric morphometrics; Macaque; Mangabey; Ontogeny; Sexual dimorphism","ontogeny; primate; sexual dimorphism; Cercocebus; Crania; Lophocebus; Macaca; Mammalia; Mandrillus; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Primates; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036282288

Similarities in form between Victoria West cores, in terms of surface morphology and the removal of large flakes from a prepared surface, led to hypothesized schemes of technological evolution from Victoria West cores through to fully developed Levallois cores. However, the phylogenetic basis of this Victoria West ""proto-Levallois"" hypothesis, and the assumptions of phylogenetic homology upon which it rests, have never been tested formally. In recent years, archaeologists have begun to use phylogenetic methods drawn from biology to test hypotheses of technological and cultural evolution. Here, the phylogenetic assumptions of the Victoria West ""proto-Levallois"" hypothesis are tested directly using a cladistic (maximum parsimony) protocol. The cladistic analyses indicate that Victoria West cores are not the basal sister taxon of a Levallois clade, as predicted by the proto-Levallois hypothesis. Moreover, character analyses demonstrate that several characters relating to core surfaces and flake scar morphology are not phylogenetically homologous, but result from convergent technological evolution within the Acheulean techno-complex. Post hoc analyses further determine that these results are not confounded by choice of outgroup or raw material factors. The results were also shown to be robust on the basis of the ensemble retention index statistic, bootstrap analyses, and permutation tests. Hence, it is concluded that Victoria West cores do not represent a ""proto-Levallois"" core form, and that the term ""para-Levallois"" should more correctly be applied on phylogenetic grounds. It is further argued that even in cases where different technologies are found to share phylogenetically homologous features, use of the term ""proto"" is questionable on theoretical grounds. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, it addresses whether males and females of each species share a common postnatal ontogenetic shape trajectory for the facial skeleton. Where trajectories are found to differ, it is tested whether male and female trajectories: 1) diverge early, or 2) diverge later after sharing a common trajectory earlier in the postnatal period. Where ontogenetic shape trajectories are found to be shared, it is also tested whether males and females are ontogenetically scaled. This study uses geometric morphometric analyses of 28 landmarks from the facial skeletons of 137 G. g. gorilla (62 adults; 75 juveniles), 95 P. paniscus (34 adults; 61 juveniles), and 115 P. t. troglodytes (58 adults; 57 juveniles). On average, males and females share a common ontogenetic shape trajectory until around the eruption of the second permanent molars. In addition, for the same period, males and females in each species share a common ontogenetic scaling trajectory. After this period, males and females diverge both from each other and from the common juvenile ontogenetic shape and scaling trajectories within each species.

A. Mead discovered a spear in association with an elephant skeleton near Miami in Roberts County, Texas. During 1937 this locality was excavated. The elephant bones were found in an old, now completely filled, sink which had been a water-hole. The lower part of the fill in the sink contained no recognizable fossils, but at a level 1 or 1% feet below the present surface was a bone layer extending entirely across the sink. Above this level, no additional bones were found. No bones other than elephant were present. The conditions of occurrence indicate that several elephants are present, ranging in age from very young to mature. In the bone bed were found one scraper and three spears. One of the spears lay about 3 inches from, and at the same level as, the first cervical vertebra of an elephant. Another spear and the scraper were near elephant bones. The artifacts are of the Folsom or Folsom-like culture type. Whether the elephants were trapped or bogged at this water-hole or suffered from drought or illness is unknown. The sink in which the fossils are found is much older than the modern sinks of this region, as shown by the fact that it had become completely filled. The age of the deposits is not fully determined. It is, however, evident that important faunal and topographic changes have occurred since the artifacts and elephant remains were included in this deposit. © 1938 Geological Society of America.",,"Deposits; Tools; Cervical vertebra; Level-1; Roberts; Sink-in; Topographic changes; Bone; biostratigraphy; bone; drought stress; elephant; fossil record; skeleton; Florida [United States]; Miami; Texas; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042682978

This study reports the results of AMS-radiocarbon dating of specific amino acids from Bison antiquus bone associated with the type Plainview and Firstview assemblages from the Plainview and Olsen-Chubbuck sites, respectively. Seven samples of bone and teeth from Plainview produced a surprisingly wide array of ages. As a result, the age of the bone bed and the type Plainview collection remain uncertain, but it is most likely ≥ 10,000 B.P. (but late or post-Folsom) given the dating and stratigraphic relationships at Plainview and other sites. Seven samples of bone from Olsen-Chubbuck yielded a tight cluster of ages averaging ca 9400 B.P., fitting well with other dated Firstview features on the Southern Plains. These results show that much better age control from more sites is needed in order to understand the Paleoindian record. AMS-radiocarbon dating of specific amino acids from bone has revolutionized such issues of chronology in archaeology, but like any other method, it can provide confusing results and must be used in conjunction with other chronometric data.

We modified the median axis technique to define novel measurements, which proved complementary to those obtained from conventional landmarks. Allometric analyses showed that the scaling of the mandible among the New World tree squirrels is generally isometric (as has been observed in other groups of mammals), but diverges from isometry in a tendency in smaller animals for the masseteric ridge to be displaced anteriorly, the condylar process and posterior portion of the ascending ramus to be relatively elongated, and the coronoid process to be shortened. Allometric analyses also revealed the ways and extent that outgroup taxa deviated from the scaling pattern observed for the New World tree squirrels. A flying squirrel (subfamily Pteromyinae), a moderate-sized callosciurine squirrel, and three species of pygmy tree squirrels from Asia and Africa show mandibular proportions very similar to those predicted for New World tree squirrels of corresponding size. Ground squirrels (tribe Marmotini) and successively more distant relatives such as Aplodontia, two myomorph rodents, and a rabbit show greater differences from the New World tree squirrels in their mandibular proportions.

Location: Equatorial Africa. Methods: Sixty-four three-dimensional cranial landmarks were measured on 276 adult red colobus monkeys sampled over their entire distribution. Geometric morphometric methods were applied, and size and shape variables regressed onto geographical coordinates using linear and curvilinear models. Model selection was done using the second-order Akaike information criterion. Components of variation related to geography, taxon or their combined effect were partitioned using partial regresssion. Multivariate trends in clinal shape were summarized using principal components of predictions from regressions, plotting vector scores on maps as for univariate size, and visualizing differences along main axes of clinal shape variation using surface rendering. Results: Significant clinal variation was found in size and shape. Clines were similar in females and males. Trend surface analysis tended to be more accurate and parsimonious than alternative models in predicting morphology based on geography. Cranial form was relatively paedomorphic in East Africa and peramorphic in central Africa. Most taxonomic variation was geographically structured. However, taxonomic differences alone accounted for a larger proportion of total explained variance in shape (up to 40%) than in size (≤.20%). Main conclusions: A strong cline explained most of the observed size variation and a significant part of the shape differences of red colobus crania. The pattern of geographical variation was largely similar to that previously reported in vervets, despite different habitat preferences (arboreal versus terrestrial) and a long period since divergence (c. 14 - 15 Myr). This suggests that some aspects of morphological divergence in both groups may have been influenced by similar environmental, geographical and historical factors. Cranial size is likely to be evolutionarily more labile and thus better reflects the influence of recent environmental changes. Cranial shape could be more resilient to change and thus better reflects phylogenetically informative differences. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing.","Akaike information criterion; Central Africa; Clinal variation; Cranial shape; Cranial size; Curvilinear models; Geometric morphometrics; Partial regression; Piliocolobus; Surface rendering","cranium; geographical distribution; geographical variation; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; numerical model; primate; principal component analysis; taxonomy; Africa; Central Africa; East Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Colobinae; Colobus sp.; Crania; Piliocolobus; Primates; Procolobus badius",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-60349098558

Analysis of the Folsom lithic assemblage recovered from the site focuses on defining patterns of raw material procurement, tool use, and manufacture.

At the site, local raw materials were used expediently to aid in the processing of the kill and in the production of tools for future use. Tools transported to the site were made primarily of Edwards and Alibates chert. The assemblages of Edwards and Alibates exhibit different degrees of depletion and suggest a visit to Edwards quarries was made subsequent to a visit to Alibates quarries.
