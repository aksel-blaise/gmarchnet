The common control of digit and gonad differentiation raises the possibility that patterns of digit formation may relate to spermatogenesis and hormonal concentrations. This work was concerned with the ratio between the length of the 2nd and 4th digit (2D:4D) in humans. We showed that (i) 2D:4D in right and left hands has a sexually dimorphic pattern; in males mean 2D:4D = 0.98, i.e. the 4th digit tended to be longer than the 2nd and in females mean 2D:4D = 1.00, i.e. the 2nd and 4th digits tended to be of equal length. The dimorphism is present from at least age 2 years and 2D:4D is probably established in utero; (ii) high 2D:4D ratio in right hands was associated with germ cell failure in men (P = 0.04); (iii) sperm number was negatively related to 2D:4D in the right hand (P = 0.004); (iv) in men testosterone concentrations were negatively related to right hand 2D:4D and in women and men LH (right hand), oestrogen (right and left hands) and prolactin (right hand) concentrations were positively correlated with 2D:4D ratio and (v) 2D:4D ratio in right hands remained positively related to luteinizing hormone and oestrogen after controlling for sex, age, height and weight.","2nd digit:4th digit ratio; Luteinizing hormone; Oestrogen; Spermatozoa; Testosterone","estrogen; luteinizing hormone; prolactin; testosterone; adolescent; adult; article; body height; body weight; child; controlled study; estrogen blood level; female; finger; germ cell; hand; human; luteinizing hormone blood level; male; normal human; prolactin blood level; right handedness; sex difference; spermatozoon count; testosterone blood level; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031783419

This type of symmetry is called object symmetry and is distinguished from matching symmetry, in which two separate structures exist as mirror images of each other, one on each body side. We explain a method for partitioning the total shape variation of landmark configurations with object symmetry into components of symmetric variation among individuals and asymmetry. This method is based on the Procrustes superimposition of the original and a reflected copy of each landmark configuration and is compatible with the two-factor ANOVA model customary in studies of fluctuating asymmetry. We show a fully multivariate framework for testing the effects in the two-factor model with MANOVA statistics, which also applies to shapes with matching symmetry. We apply the new methods in a small case study of pharyngeal jaws of the Neotropical cichlid fish Amphilophus citrinellus. The analysis revealed that the symmetric component of variation in the pharyngeal jaws is dominated by the contrast between two alternative trophic morphs in this species and that there is subtle but statistically significant directional asymmetry. Finally, we provide some general recommendations for morphometric studies of symmetric shapes.","Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological variation; Procrustes superimposition; Shape analysis; Symmetry","symmetry; Amphilophus citrinellus; Animalia; Cichlidae; Procrustes; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036807802

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

We analysed these and other ancient genomes1-4 with 2,345 contemporary humans to show that most present-day Europeans derive from at least three highly differentiated populations: west European hunter-gatherers, who contributed ancestry to all Europeans but not to Near Easterners; ancient north Eurasians related to Upper Palaeolithic Siberians3, who contributed to both Europeans and Near Easterners; and early European farmers, who were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harboured west European hunter-gatherer related ancestry. We model these populations' deep relationships and show that early European farmers had ∼44% ancestry from a 'basal Eurasian' population that split before the diversification of other non-African lineages. ©2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In males, digit 2 is shorter than digit 4, but in females digit 2 is the same length or longer than digit 4. The second- to fourth-digit (2D:4D) ratio correlates with numerous sexually dimorphic behavioral and physiological conditions. Although correlational studies suggest that digit ratios reflect prenatal exposure to androgen, the developmental mechanism underlying sexually dimorphic digit development remains unknown. Here we report that the 2D:4D ratio in mice is controlled by the balance of androgen to estrogen signaling during a narrow window of digit development. Androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor α (ER-α) activity is higher in digit 4 than in digit 2. Inactivation of AR decreases growth of digit 4, which causes a higher 2D:4D ratio, whereas inactivation of ER-αincreases growth of digit 4, which leads to a lower 2D:4D ratio. We also show that addition of androgen has the same effect as inactivation of ER and that addition of estrogen mimics the reduction of AR. Androgen and estrogen differentially regulate the network of genes that controls chondrocyte proliferation, leading to differential growth of digit 4 in males and females. These studies identify previously undescribed molecular dimorphisms between male and female limb buds and provide experimental evidence that the digit ratio is a lifelong signature of prenatal hormonal exposure. Our results also suggest that the 2D:4D ratio can serve as an indicator of disrupted endocrine signaling during early development, which may aid in the identification of fetal origins of adult diseases.","Limb development; Sexual dimorphism; Steroid hormones","androgen; androgen receptor; estrogen; estrogen receptor alpha; transcription factor Sox9; animal experiment; article; cartilage cell; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; controlled study; female; finger; gene control; human; index finger; limb bud; male; mouse; nonhuman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; sex difference; signal transduction; Androgens; Animals; Estrogens; Fingers; Humans; Mice; Receptors, Androgen; Receptors, Estrogen; Sex Characteristics; Signal Transduction; Mus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053629822

Although Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians, there is no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to. Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania from the First Americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First Americans. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"mitochondrial DNA; anatomy; chromosome; divergence; ethnic group; genetic analysis; genome; human evolution; hunter-gatherer; Mesolithic; morphology; Paleolithic; population structure; American Indian; article; DNA damage; gene flow; gene frequency; human; human genome; Mesolithic; mitochondrial genome; Paleolithic; priority journal; Russian Federation; single nucleotide polymorphism; Y chromosome; American Indian; animal; Asia; Asian continental ancestry group; Caucasian; classification; ethnology; genetics; haplotype; human genome; male; migration; phylogeny; phylogeography; skeleton; Malta; Crania; Animals; Asia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Chromosomes, Human, Y; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; European Continental Ancestry Group; Gene Flow; Genome, Human; Genome, Mitochondrial; Haplotypes; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Siberia; Skeleton",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892367625

We compared new mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from late European hunter-gatherer skeletons with those from early farmers and from modern Europeans. We find large genetic differences between all three groups that cannot be explained by population continuity alone. Most (82%) of the ancient hunter-gatherers share mtDNA types that are relatively rare in central Europeans today.

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption. We consider the implications of these findings in terms of the potential for these approaches in the study of comparative growth in related species.","Facial remodelling; Geometric morphometrics; Thin plate spline analysis","age; allometry; article; cercocebus; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; face growth; female; geometry; male; molar tooth; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; sex difference; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Anthropometry; Bone Remodeling; Cercocebus; Facial Bones; Female; Male; Models, Anatomic; Sex Characteristics; Cercocebus; Cercocebus torquatus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031724058

All mtDNAs with this mutation were then screened for a number of diagnostic RFLP sites, revealing two major subsets of mtDNAs. One is haplogroup V proper, and the other has been termed ""pre*V,"" since it predates V phylogenetically. The rather uncommon pre*V tends to be scattered throughout Europe (and northwestern Africa), whereas V attains two peaks of frequency: one situated in southwestern Europe and one in the Saami of northern Scandinavia. Geographical distributions and ages support the scenario that pre*V originated in Europe before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), whereas the more recently derived haplogroup V arose in a southwestern European refugium soon after the LGM. The arrival of V in eastern/central Europe, however, occurred much later, possibly with (post-)Neolithic contacts. The distribution of haplogroup V mtDNAs in modern European populations would thus, at least in part, reflect the pattern of postglacial human recolonization from that refugium, affecting even the Saami. Overall, the present study shows that the dissection of mtDNA variation into small and well-defined evolutionary units is an essential step in the identification of spatial frequency patterns. Mass screening of a few markers identified using complete mtDNA sequences promises to be an efficient strategy for inferring features of human prehistory.",,"mitochondrial DNA; nucleotide; age; article; controlled study; DNA sequence; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic susceptibility; geographic distribution; haplotype; human; mass screening; phylogeny; priority journal",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034822098

This review (1) evaluates current evidence for the relationship between digit ratios and prenatal androgens (using experimentation with animal models, amniotic testosterone, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia case-control studies), (2) describes opportunities for future validation tests, and (3) compares the potential advantages and disadvantages of digit ratio measures with more established methods for studying the effects of prenatal androgens. © 2006 McIntyre; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"androgen; testosterone; androgen; biological marker; testosterone; amnion fluid analysis; behavior; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; fertility; finger; hormone action; human; morbidity; nonhuman; perinatal period; review; risk assessment; validity; animal; animal model; biosynthesis; dizygotic twins; fetus; finger; growth, development and aging; histology; male; metabolism; sexual development; Animalia; Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital; Androgens; Animals; Biological Markers; Fetus; Fingers; Humans; Male; Models, Animal; Sex Characteristics; Testosterone; Twins, Dizygotic",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645147860

Here, we review the new chronology and compare mtDNA with Y-chromosome patterns, in order to summarize what we have learnt from archaeogenetics concerning five episodes over the past 50,000 years which significantly contributed to the settlement history of Europe: the pioneer colonisation of the Upper Palaeolithic, the Late Glacial re-colonisation of the continent from southern refugia after the Last Glacial Maximum, the postglacial re-colonization of deserted areas after the Younger Dryas cold snap, the arrival of Near Easterners with an incipient Neolithic package, and the small-scale migrations along continent-wide economic exchange networks beginning with the Copper Age. The available data from uniparental genetic systems have already transformed our view of the prehistory of Europe, but our knowledge of these processes remains limited. Nevertheless, their legacy remains as sedimentary layers in the gene pool of modern Europeans, and our understanding of them will improve substantially when more mtDNAs are completely sequenced, the Y chromosome more thoroughly analysed, and haplotype blocks of the autosomal genome become amenable to phylogeographic studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, using uranium-series dating of coralloid speleothems directly associated with 12 human hand stencils and two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art. The earliest dated image from Maros, with a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world. In addition, a painting of a babirusa ('pig-deer') made at least 35.4 kyr ago is among the earliest dated figurative depictions worldwide, if not the earliest one. Among the implications, it can now be demonstrated that humans were producing rock art by ∼40 kyr ago at opposite ends of the Pleistocene Eurasian world. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here we use the methods of geometric morphometrics to study integration in the wing of Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, we focus on the hypothesis that the anterior and posterior wing compartments are separate developmental units that vary independently. We measured both variation among genetically diverse individuals and random differences between body sides of single individuals (fluctuating asymmetry, FA). For both of these sources of variation, the patterns of variation identified by principal component analyses all involved landmarks in both the anterior and posterior compartments simultaneously. Analyses focusing exclusively on the covariation between the anterior and posterior compartments, by the partial least-squares method, revealed pervasive integration of the two compartments, for both individual variation and FA. These analyses clearly indicate that the anterior and posterior compartments are not separate units of variation, but that the covariation between compartments is sufficient to account for nearly all the variation throughout the entire wing. We conclude that variation among individuals as well as the developmental perturbations responsible for FA generate shape variation primarily through developmental processes that are integrated across both compartments. In contrast, much less of the shape variation in our sample can be attributed to the localized processes that establish the identity of particular wing veins.","Compartments; Drosophila melanogaster; Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Modularity; Morphological integration; Wing veins","animal; article; biological model; cross breeding; Drosophila melanogaster; evolution; female; forelimb; genetic variability; genetics; growth, development and aging; histology; male; physiology; regression analysis; statistical model; Animals; Crosses, Genetic; Drosophila melanogaster; Evolution; Female; Least-Squares Analysis; Male; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Variation (Genetics); Wing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033626266

We found significant sex differences such that males had lower 2D:4D than females and the effect size of the sex differences was greatest for right hand 2D:4D. Mean 2D:4D was lower for right hands than for left hands in men, but lower for left hands compared to right hands in women. The sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D was present across ethnic and country groupings, suggesting that it is universal in humans. However, there was also evidence that mean 2D:4D varied across ethnic groups with higher ratios for Whites, Non-Chinese Asians, and Mid-Easterners and lower ratios in Chinese and Black samples. There were significant differences in 2D:4D across sexual orientation groups but these were confined to men. Male homosexuals and bisexuals had higher mean 2D:4D (suggesting exposure to lower prenatal T) than heterosexuals. The effect was present in Whites, but there was no evidence for the pattern among Black and Chinese participants. In women, there were no significant effects of sexual orientation on 2D:4D. Most studies of sexual orientation effects on 2D:4D have measured finger length from photocopies of the hands. In comparison, our self-reported measures gave higher mean 2D:4D, lower effect sizes, and, in some instances, different patterns of effect size.

Even quite limited volumes of complete mtDNA sequence data can now be used to identify the critical polymorphisms that define sub-clades within an mtDNA haplogroup, providing a springboard for large-scale high-resolution screening of human mtDNAs. This strategy has in the past been applied to mtDNA haplogroup V, which represents <5% of European mtDNAs. Here we adopted a similar approach to haplogroup H, by far the most common European haplogroup, which at lower resolution displayed a rather uninformative frequency distribution within Europe. Using polymorphism information derived from the growing complete mtDNA sequence database, we sequenced 1580 base pairs of targeted coding-region segments of the mtDNA genome in 649 individuals harboring mtDNA haplogroup H from populations throughout Europe, the Caucasus, and the Near East. The enhanced genealogical resolution clearly shows that sub-clades of haplogroup H have highly distinctive geographical distributions. The patterns of frequency and diversity suggest that haplogroup H entered Europe from the Near East ∼20,000-25,000 years ago, around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and some sub-clades re-expanded from an Iberian refugium when the glaciers retreated ∼15,000 years ago. This shows that a large fraction of the maternal ancestry of modern Europeans traces back to the expansion of hunter-gatherer populations at the end of the last Ice Age. © 2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",,"mitochondrial DNA; article; controlled study; DNA polymorphism; DNA sequence; Europe; gene frequency; genetic code; genetic screening; genetic variability; geographic distribution; human; human experiment; last glacial maximum; nucleotide sequence; population distribution; population dynamics; population genetics; priority journal; restriction fragment length polymorphism; sequence analysis; species refuge; unindexed sequence; DNA, Mitochondrial; Electron Transport Complex IV; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Humans; Molecular Sequence Data; Portugal; Spain",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-19944431813

European populations are believed to be, to a large extent, the descendants of the inhabitants of these refugia, and some extant mtDNA lineages can be traced to refugia in Franco-Cantabria (haplogroups H1, H3, V, and U5b1), the Italian Peninsula (U5b3), and the East European Plain (U4 and U5a). Parts of the Near East, such as the Levant, were also continuously inhabited throughout the Last Glacial Maximum, but unlike western and eastern Europe, no archaeological or genetic evidence for Late Glacial expansions into Europe from the Near East has hitherto been discovered. Here we report, on the basis of an enlarged whole-genome mitochondrial database, that a substantial, perhaps predominant, signal from mitochondrial haplogroups J and T, previously thought to have spread primarily from the Near East into Europe with the Neolithic population, may in fact reflect dispersals during the Late Glacial period, ∼19-12 thousand years (ka) ago. © 2012 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

In Europe, the events most widely considered to have had a major impact on patterns of genetic diversity are the initial colonization of the continent by anatomically modern humans (AMH), the last glacial maximum, and the Neolithic transition. For some decades it was assumed that the geographical structuring of genetic diversity within Europe was mainly the result of gene flow during and soon after the Neolithic transition, but recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, computer simulation modeling, and ancient DNA (aDNA) analyses are challenging this simplistic view.

Demographic models based on increased human population density from the late Pleistocene onward have been increasingly invoked to understand the emergence of behavioral modernity. However, high levels of social tolerance, as seen among living humans, are a necessary prerequisite to life at higher population densities and to the kinds of cooperative cultural behaviors essential to these demographic models. Here we provide data on craniofacial feminization (reduction in average brow ridge projection and shortening of the upper facial skeleton) in Homo sapiens from the Middle Pleistocene to recent times. We argue that temporal changes in human craniofacial morphology reflect reductions in average androgen reactivity (lower levels of adult circulating testosterone or reduced androgen receptor densities), which in turn reflect the evolution of enhanced social tolerance since the Middle Pleistocene. © 2014 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

For these scenarios, techniques for sex determination may play a vital part of the medicolegal investigation. Five hundred hands (230 males, 270 females) from North and South Indian region were studied to investigate sexual dimorphism in hand dimensions (hand length, hand breadth, and palm length). The hand index (hand breadth/hand length × 100) and the palm index (hand breadth/palm length × 100) were derived. The hand dimensions show a higher accuracy in sex determination when compared to indices. Of all hand dimensions, hand breadth has the highest accuracy of sex determination in the study group. The sex differences were found to be statistically significant only for the hand index on the left side. The morphometric parameters of the hand show considerable sexual dimorphism in the Indian population while the hand and palm index remain poor sex indicators.

At El Castillo Cave, application of U-series dating to calcite accretions has established a minimum age of 37,290 years for underlying red hand stencils, implying execution in the earlier part of the Aurignacian if not beforehand. Together with the series of red disks, one of which has a minimum age of 40,800 years, these motifs lie at the base of the El Castillo parietal stratigraphy. The similarity in technique and colour support the notion that both kinds of artistic manifestations are synchronic and define an initial, non-figurative phase of European cave art. However, available data indicate that hand stencils continued to be painted subsequently. Currently, the youngest, reliably dated examples fall in the Late Gravettian, approximately 27,000 years ago. © 2015, Istituto Italiano di Antropologia.

Further research increased the sample of measurable cases from 6 to 32, a large enough sample to show that persons who made hand stencils in the caves were predominantly females. This finding rebuts the traditional assumption that human hand stencils in European parietal art were made by male artists, either adults or subadults. Findings further suggest that the sexual dimorphism of hands was more pronounced during the Upper Paleolithic than it is in modern Europeans. Attempts to apply the same algorithms to a sample of North American Indian handprints confirms the view that different populations require separate analyses.

Presently, however, the majority of previous related research has been focused on a limited range of global populations. The aim of the present study, therefore, is to evaluate the accuracy of using anthropometric hand measurements for the estimation of sex in a contemporary adult Western Australian population; we also assess if sex can be accurately estimated from the measurement of handprints.The study sample comprises a total of 91 male and 110 female individuals; documented mean age for the males is 38. years (range 19-68) and for the female sample it is 36. years (range 18-63). A total of six linear measurements are taken from each hand and its corresponding print. Measurement data is analysed using basic univariate statistics and a series of direct and stepwise discriminant function analyses are performed to assess the sex classification potential of the hand and handprint variables.All six hand and handprint measurements are sexually dimorphic and sex explains 28.4-61.7% of the sample variance. The breadth and length of the hand contribute most significantly to sex discrimination; cross-validated sex classification accuracies range between 82.6 and 96.5% with a sex bias of ≤5%. We conclude that anthropometric measurements of the hand and handprint can be used to classify sex with a high degree of expected accuracy in a Western Australian population. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Forensic anthropology; Forensic anthropometry; Hand anthropometry; Handprints; Population standards; Sex estimation; Sexual dimorphism","accuracy; adult; aged; anthropometric parameters; anthropometry; article; Australia; classification; female; gender bias; hand; hand breadth; hand length; human; male; physical anthropology; priority journal; sex determination; sex difference",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864351301

It has been suggested that both males and females were involved in symbolic activities, which has shaped the view of gender roles in prehistory. The experience from biological and forensic anthropology suggests, however, that using recent standards for the sex estimation of prehistoric handprints may be prone to errors. The aim of this study is to document the accuracy and reliability of sex estimation from handprints in a recent European sample and to assess the applicability of recent standards to the sex prediction of prehistoric artists. Our sample consists from 100 handprints of recent males and females from southern France. The sex of handprints is estimated by two discriminant functions using five direct measurements (DFdirect) and two indices (DFindex). The results showed that DFdirect correctly predicts sex in 92% of recent handprints but only about half the handprints can be classified with a certainty higher than 95%. The accuracy of DFindex is only 63% and cannot be successfully applied to sex estimation. We further suggest that the accuracy of both functions is overestimated due to the correct classification of handprints by chance and that especially DFindex is able to predict sex even in randomised datasets with no sexual differences. Finally, we demonstrate that both DFdirect and DFindex perform poorly when they are applied to population with hand size different from that used to derive them, i.e. that functions do not generalise across different populations and time periods. We argue that, given the lack of information about hand size in the population of prehistoric artists, recent attempts to estimate sex from handprints depicted in Palaeolithic cave art using morphometric data from recent populations is inevitably associated with unpredictable bias. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Accuracy; Bias; Digit ratio; Handprints; Reliability; Rock art; Sex estimation","accuracy assessment; anthropology; archaeological evidence; cave; estimation method; gender role; morphometry; Paleolithic; prehistoric; reliability analysis; rock art; France",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896043988

The caves and rock shelters cluster into three groups in terms of their elevations in the karstic landscape and their archaeological remains. The highest and most inaccessible caves are the locations of rock paintings. Caves at middle locations have produced evidence for funerary activity. Large, dry rock shelters, mostly flat-bottomed, at the foot of the cliffs were preferred for habitation. The paintings consist especially of hand stencils but also include anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures as well as other motifs. A stalactite date indicates that the earliest hand stencils may predate ca. 10,000 B.P., and drawings of what may be extinct animals suggest that some of the other motifs could be of such antiquity. The funerary material includes both pottery similar to Neolithic material elsewhere in Borneo and also later material associated with bronze artifacts. Some of the habitation sites may be pre-Neolithic on the evidence of multiple AMS dates between 4000 and 11750 B.P.; others are more recent. A particular focus of further research will need to be an attempt to establish the antiquity and the authorship of the rock art, and its relationship, if any, to the Holocene uses of the caves for burials and habitation. © 2005 by the University of Hawai'i Press.","Borneo; Cave burial; Cave habitation; Kalimantan; Rock art","archaeological evidence; Holocene; rock art; Asia; East Kalimantan; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Indonesia; Southeast Asia; World; Animalia; Artocarpus odoratissimus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-24344447161

Their positioning within the painted caves of France and Spain is far from random, but responds to the shapes and fissures in the cave walls. Made under conditions of low and flickering light, the authors suggest that touch-'palpation'-as much as vision, would have driven and directed the locations chosen for these stencils. Detailed study of the images in two Cantabrian caves also allows different individuals to be distinguished, most of whom appear to have been female.

Of course, the analysis of current genetic data offers several explanations about human migration patterns which occurred on this continent, but it fails to explain precisely the impact of each demographic event. In this context, direct access to the DNA of ancient specimens allows the overcoming of recent demographic phenomena, which probably highly modified the constitution of the current European gene pool. In recent years, several DNA studies have been successfully conducted from ancient human remains thanks to the improvement of molecular techniques. They have brought new fundamental information on the peopling of Europe and allowed us to refine our understanding of European prehistory.

However, some of the mtDNA lineages found in the Cantabrian fringe in Paleolithic-Mesolithic times persist in present-day populations. The mtDNA variability observed in hunter-gatherers and farmers in Europe denoted a complex pattern for the Neolithic transition, occurring along several different routes into and across Europe. The mtDNA lineages found in the Cantabrian fringe indicated that the dispersion of Neolithic farmers had a different genetic impact in this area with respect to Central and Mediterranean regions of Europe.

Sexual identity has previously been manually determined by measuring the ratios of the lengths of the individual's fingers as well as by using other physical features. Most conventional studies measure the lengths manually and thus are often constrained by the lack of scaling information on published images. We have created a method that determines sex by applying modern machine-learning techniques to relative measures obtained from images of human hands. This is the known attempt at substituting automated methods for time-consuming manual measurement in the study of sexual identities of prehistoric cave artists. Our study provides quantitative evidence relevant to sexual dimorphism and the sexual division of labor in Upper Paleolithic societies. In addition to analyzing historical handprint records, this method has potential applications in criminal forensics and human-computer interaction. © 2010 ACM.","archaeology; handprint; image analysis; prehistoric cave art; upper paleolithic","archaeology; Automated methods; Division of labor; handprint; Human hands; Machine-learning; Modern machines; Physical features; Potential applications; prehistoric cave art; Sexual dimorphism; upper paleolithic; Caves; Computer crime; History; Image analysis; Knowledge management; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650971537

Utilizing a series of equations created from an experimental collection of 271 hand sprays of known authorship, the age and sex of individuals responsible for the creation of 78 archaeological hand sprays from three rock art sites located in Johnson County, Wyoming were estimated. The archaeological sprays were measured using three-dimensional models created with close range photogrammetry. Of the total, 49 sprays were sufficiently complete to be identified as children or male or female adults as participants in spray creation. The results suggest that hand sprays were created by children and adults of both sexes suggesting non-exclusivity in activities associated with rock art creation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Hand sprays; Paleodemographic; Photogrammetry; Plains; Rock art",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933504477

Studies of physical traits, however, are usually limited to size-related biological characteristics because it is inherently difficult to quantify the morphological counterpart - shape. In recent years, the development of geometry-preserving analytical techniques built upon multivariate statistical methodologies has produced a new discipline in biological shape analysis known as geometric morphometrics. In this study of hand shape analysis, we introduce the reader already familiar with the field of twin research to the potential utility of geometric morphometrics and demonstrate the cross-discipline applicability of methods. We also investigate and compare the efficacy of the 2D:4D ratio, a commonly used marker of sexual dimorphism, to the fully multivariate approach of shape analysis in discriminating between male and female sex. Studies of biological shape variation utilizing geometric morphometric techniques may be completed with software freely available on the Internet and time invested to master the small learning curve in concepts and theory. © The Authors 2013.","2D:4D ratio; geometric morphometrics; sexual dimorphism","article; computer program; hand shape; Internet; learning curve; morphometrics; priority journal; sex determination; sex difference; twins; Anthropometry; Biological Markers; Female; Hand; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Prospective Studies; Registries; Sex Characteristics; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875970336

The results of experiments using these methods are evaluated from the point of view of the bearing they have on our knowledge about the creation of the original pictures in the cave. There are some 230 known images of human hands painted on the walls of the cave of Gargas, near Aventignan, Hautes-Pyrénées, France.1These are difficult to date, but may be as much as 30,000 years old. Many of these hand pictures show some deficiency of finger joints, for which Janssens2 and Sahly34 5have put forward possible medical and non-medical explanations, without coming to any definite conclusions.45 One of us [M.W.] has completed a series of tests attempting to recreate negative hand images in the style of those at Gargas, on a variety of materials including limestone and paper. The aim of the tests was to learn more about the methods the Gargas painters may have used to achieve their results and about some of the problems they may have encountered. The tests might also suggest clues as to whether or not actual deficient human hands were used as templates for the paintings. Many of the paintings of hands in the cave show clear evidence of being applied by some paint-spraying technique. Thus, the following three spraying methods were used to apply two mixes of red ochre (i.e., haematite), one with water, the other with milk. The ochre had been obtained, via a concrete products firm, from a natural source in central Derbyshire, England. (1) With paint held in the mouth and then blown on to the background through tightly pressed and vibrating lips. (2) With a plastic straw or reed 200 mm long by 4 mm diameter, which had been cut two-thirds through the circumference approximately 40 mm from one end. When bent to a right-angle, the short end was held in the paint solution while the operator blew into the long end of the reed. A spray of paint was thus emitted through the split in the reed. (3) With a commercial spray normally used for “misting” plants. Each of these spraying methods was used with the following templates, (a) The operator’s hand held against a wall or other support, sometimes with fingers bent to simulate missing joints, (b) Positive images of hands, made by spreading wet clay on the palm and then applying the palm to the wall. Any gaps in the positive images thus produced on the wall were filled in with more clay. The various spraying methods were then carried out. When dry, the clay readily flaked off the wall leaving a negative hand print, (c) Templates of hands, some with finger joints missing, cut from thin card to simulate birch bark, held against a wall or other support. © 1982, Cambridge University Press.
