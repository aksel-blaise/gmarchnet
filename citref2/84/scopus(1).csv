Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

The sequence is tightly controlled by 20 precise ages on volcanic materials. These ages are internally consistent but are at variance with estimates for the boundaries of the magnetic polarity time scale by about 0.07 my. This discrepancy can be only partially resolved at present. Based on the established chronometric framework and stratigraphic sequences, depositional ages can be estimated for significant marker beds. These ages can in turn be used to constrain the 449 hominid specimens thus far reported from the basin. Ages for most hominid specimens can be estimated with a precision of ±0.05 my. In addition, the chronometric framework will be applicable to other paleontological collections, archeological excavations, and future discoveries in the basin.

To clarify how and when these differences arise in ontogeny, we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Honto sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96 traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor the differences among the African apes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Since its synonimization into Homo, views of the species and its distribution have varied from a single, widely dispersed, polytypic species ultimately ancestral to all later Homo, to a derived, regional isolate ultimately marginal to later hominin evolution. A revised chronostratigraphic framework and recent work bearing either directly or indirectly on reconstructions of life-history patterns are reviewed here and, together with a review of the cranial and postcranial anatomy of H. erectus, are used to generate a natural history of the species. Here I argue that H. erectus is a hominin, notable for its increased body size, that originates in the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene of Africa and quickly disperses into Western and Eastern Asia. It is also an increasingly derived hominin with several regional morphs sustained by intermittent isolation, particularly in Southeast Asia. This view differs from several current views, most especially that which recognizes only a single hominin species in the Pleistocene, H. sapiens, and those which would atomize H. erectus into a multiplicity of taxa. Following Jolly ([2001] Yrbk Phys Anthropol 44:177-204), the regional morphs of H. erectus may be productively viewed as geographically replacing allotaxa, rather than as the focus of unresolvable species debates. Such a view allows us to focus on the adaptations and biology of local groups, including questions of biogeographic isolation and local adaptation. A number of issues remain unresolved, including the significance of diversity in size and shape in the early African and Georgian records. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Africa; China; Dispersal; H. ergaster; Indonesia; Life history","anatomical variation; anatomy; biodiversity; biogeographic region; chronosequence; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; geographic distribution; history; hominid; homo erectus; human; life history; Pliocene; review; stratigraphy; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Pithecanthropus",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0942301483

Here, we examine cranial variation among Pleistocene and recent human fossils by using a model of cranial growth to identify unique derived features (autapomorphies) that reliably distinguish fossils attributed to ""anatomically modern"" H. sapiens (AMHS) from those attributed to various taxa of ""archaic"" Homo spp. (AH) and to test hypotheses about the changes in cranial development that underlie the origin of modern human cranial form. In terms of pattern, AMHS crania are uniquely characterized by two general structural autapomorphies: facial retraction and neurocranial globularity. Morphometric analysis of the ontogeny of these autapomorphies indicates that the developmental changes that led to modern human cranial form derive from a combination of shifts in cranial base angle, cranial fossae length and width, and facial length. These morphological changes, some of which may have occurred because of relative size increases in the temporal and possibly the frontal lobes, occur early in ontogeny, and their effects on facial retraction and neurocranial globularity discriminate AMHS from AH crania. The existence of these autapomorphies supports the hypothesis that AMHS is a distinct species from taxa of ""archaic"" Homo (e.g., Homo neanderthalensis).",,"article; evolution; face development; fossil; human; morphometrics; ontogeny; priority journal; skull base; skull development; Animals; Evolution; Hominidae; Humans; Skull; Crania; Homo; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037022224

The phenetic affinities of the Sima de los Huesos crania and a large sample of Homo fossils are investigated through principal component analyses. Metrical comparisons of the Sima de los Huesos and other European and African Middle Pleistocene fossils with Neandertals are performed using Z-scores relative to the Neandertal sample statistics. The most relevant cranial traits are metrically and morphologically analyzed and cladistically evaluated. The Sima de los Huesos crania exhibit a number of primitive traits lost in Upper Pleistocene Neandertals (especially in the braincase, but also in the facial skeleton), as well as other traits that are transitional to the Neandertal morphology (particularly in the occipital bone), and features close to what is found in Neandertals (as the supraorbital morphology and midfacial prognathism). Different combinations of primitive and derived traits (shared with Neandertals) are also displayed by the other European Middle Pleistocene fossils. In conclusion, the Sima de los Huesos sample is evolutionarily related to Neandertals as well as to the other European Middle Pleistocene fossils. In our opinion, all the European Middle Pleistocene fossils belong to the Neandertal lineage, and none can be included in an Afroeuropean common ancestor of Neandertals and modern humans. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Atapuerca; Crania; Middle Pleistocene; Morphometrics; Sima de los Huesos","Crania; Animalia; Crania; Hominidae; Primates; cranial morphology; hominid; morphometrics; Pleistocene; adult; analysis of variance; animal; article; cephalometry; child; classification; comparative study; dentition; evolution; face; facial bone; fossil; histology; hominid; human; male; methodology; multivariate analysis; paleontology; physical anthropology; skull; Spain; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cephalometry; Child; Dentition; Evolution; Face; Facial Bones; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Paleodontology; Paleontology; Skull; Spain; Spain, Castilla y Leon, Burgos, Sierra de Atapuerca",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031202616

This conclusion has had implications for the study of human variation and consideration of alternative models for the origin of modern humans. By contrast, it has often been assumed that the level of among‐group variation for morphological traits is much higher. This study examines the level of among‐group variation based on Craniometric data from a large sample of modern humans originally collected by W. W. Howells. A multivariate method based on quantitative genetics theory was used to provide an estimate of FST — a measure of among‐group variation that can be compared with results from studies of genetic markers. Data for 57 Craniometric variables on 1,734 crania were analyzed. These data represent six core areas: Europe, Sub‐Saharan Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, the Americas, and the Far East. An additional set of analyses was performed using a three‐region subset (Europe, Sub‐Saharan Africa, and the Far East) to provide comparability with several genetic studies. The minimum FST (assuming complete heritability) for the three‐region analysis is 0.065, and the minimum FST for the six‐region analysis is 0.085. Both of these are less than the average FST from genetic studies (average estimates of 0.10–0.11). The smaller value of the minimum FST estimates is expected since it provides an estimate of FST expected under complete heritability. Using an estimate of average craniometric heritability from the literature provides an estimate of FST of 0.112 for the three‐region analysis and 0.144 for the six‐region analysis. These results show that genetic and craniometric data are in agreement, qualitatively and quantitatively, and that there is limited variation in modern humans among major geographic regions. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Canonical variate analysis; Linear discriminant function; Ordination; Principal component analysis; Procrustes; Selection gradient",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952312407

Their origin likely relates to an episode of recolonization of Western Eurasia by hominins of African origin carrying the Acheulean technology into Europe around 600 ka. An enhancement of both glacial and interglacial phases may have played a crucial role in this event, as well as in the subsequent evolutionary history of the Western Eurasian populations. In addition to climatic adaptations and an increase in encephalization, genetic drift seems to have played a major role in their evolution. To date, a clear speciation event is not documented, and the most likely scenario for the fixation of Neandertal characteristics seems to be an accretion of features along the second half of the MP. Although a separation time for the African and Eurasian populations is difficult to determine, it certainly predates OIS 11 as phenotypic Neandertal features are documented as far back as and possibly before this time. It is proposed to use the term ""Homo rhodesiensis"" to designate the large-brained hominins ancestral to H. sapiens in Africa and at the root of the Neandertals in Europe, and to use the term ""Homo neanderthalensis"" to designate all of the specimens carrying derived metrical or non-metrical features used in the definition of the LP Neandertals.","Acheulean; Climate; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Pleistocene","Africa; climate; Europe; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; genetic drift; hominid; Homo antecessor; homo erectus; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo neanderthalensis; homo sapiens; human; paleontology; phenotypic variation; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; review; species differentiation; Upper Pleistocene; animal; article; classification; fossil; histology; methodology; physical anthropology; population dynamics; time; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Africa; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Europe; Evolution; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349482681

Analyses of incremental features in teeth provide an accurate means of assessing the age at death of developing dentitions, facilitating direct comparisons with fossil and modern humans. It is currently unknown when and where the prolonged modern human developmental condition originated. Here, an application of x-ray synchrotron microtomography reveals that an early Homo sapiens juvenile from Morocco dated at 160,000 years before present displays an equivalent degree of tooth development to modern European children at the same age. Crown formation times in the juvenile's macrodont dentition are higher than modern human mean values, whereas root development is accelerated relative to modern humans but is less than living apes and some fossil hominins. The juvenile from Jebel Irhoud is currently the oldest-known member of Homo with a developmental pattern (degree of eruption, developmental stage, and crown formation time) that is more similar to modern H. sapiens than to earlier members of Homo.

Some cranial regions, particularly the face and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because different cranial regions preserve population history and climate signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate adaptation; Craniofacial morphology; Human variation; Neutral genetics; Population history","accuracy; article; climate; correlation analysis; evolution; face; female; genetic distance; geometry; history; human; human tissue; hypothesis; male; morphology; morphometrics; normal human; phylogeny; population research; priority journal; reliability; skull; temporal bone; Acclimatization; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Climate; Continental Population Groups; Evolution; Face; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Temporal Bone; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845396793

Early modern humans in various portions of the Old World exhibit complex and varying mosaics of archaic, modern, and regional morphological characteristics. On the basis of this pattern, in conjunction with the emerging chronology of the earliest modern humans, the paleontological data indicate an assimilation model for modern human origins, in which the earliest modern humans emerged in astern Africa, dispersed briefly into southwestern Asia, and then subsequently spread into the remainder of Africa and southern Asia, eventually into higher latitude Eurasia. The earliest modern humans outside of the core area of eastern Africa can be understood only if a variable degree of admixture with regional groups of late archaic humans occurred. Current and expected fossil and molecular data are unlikely to illuminate the degree of assimilation that took place in most regions of the Old World. However, the current chronological and phylogenetic framework provides the basis for ongoing investigation of the nature of this Late Pleistocene transitional period.

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Current debate1 is focused on whether early representatives from Kenya and Georgia should be classified as a separate ancestral species (′H. ergaster′)2-4, and whether H. erectus was an exclusively Asian species lineage that went extinct5, 6. Lack of resolution of these issues has obscured the place of H. erectus in human evolution. A hominid calvaria and postcranial remains recently recovered from the Dakanihylo Member of the Bouri Formation, Middle Awash, Ethiopia, bear directly on these issues. These ∼1.0-million-year (Myr)-old Pleistocene sediments contain abundant early Acheulean stone tools and a diverse vertebrate fauna that indicates a predominantly savannah environment. Here we report that the ′Daka′ calvaria's metric and morphological attributes centre it firmly within H. erectus. Daka's resemblance to Asian counterparts indicates that the early African and Eurasian fossil hominids represent demes of a widespread palaeospecies. Daka's anatomical intermediacy between earlier and later African fossils provides evidence of evolutionary change.

It is widely recognized that a considerable endocranial expansion occurred throughout the evolution of the genus Homo. This article aims to evaluate whether this phenomenon was the outcome of distinct evolutionary lineages, reaching similar brain expansions but through different trajectories. Endocranial morphology was studied in a sample of fossil hominines by multivariate approaches using both traditional metrics and geometric morphometrics. The analysis was focused on the transition from a generalized archaic pattern within the genus Homo to the modern morphology and compared with changes that occurred along the Neandertal lineage. The main result was the identification of two different evolutionary trajectories, in which a similar expansion in endocranial size has been reached by different changes in shape. Along the Neandertal lineage we observed maintenance of an ""archaic"" endocranial model, in which a large amount of variability is based on a single allometric trend. By contrast, when modern endocasts were compared with nonmodern ones, we found important differences apparently led by a parietal expansion. In this light, the origin of our species may have represented the opportunity to surpass the constraints imposed on encephalization by the ontogenetic pattern shared by nonmodern Homo representatives.",,"allometry; article; body size; brain size; dura mater; encephalization; evolution; fossil; human; morphology; morphometrics; ontogeny; priority journal; skull; Animals; Brain; Evolution; Fossils; Geography; Hominidae; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Paleontology; Skull; User-Computer Interface; Homo",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347364653

If the Skhul burials took place within a relatively short time span, then the best age estimate lies between 100 and 135 ka. This result agrees very well with TL ages obtained from burnt flint of 119±18 ka (Mercier et al., 1993). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the material associated with the Skhul IX burial is older than those of Skhul II and Skhul V. These and other recent age estimates suggest that the three burial sites, Skhul, Qafzeh and Tabun are broadly contemporaneous, falling within the time range of 100 to 130 ka. The presence of early representatives of both early modern humans and Neanderthals in the Levant during Marine Isotope Stage 5 inevitably complicates attempts at segregating these populations by date or archaeological association. Nevertheless, it does appear that the oldest known symbolic burials are those of early modern humans at Skhul and Qafzeh. This supports the view that, despite the associated Middle Palaeolithic technology, elements of modern human behaviour were represented at Skhul and Qafzeh prior to 100 ka. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These are the total replacement (""Eve') and the continuity (multiregional evolution) models, both of which have clearly definable, completely different predictions about the pattern of past evolution, as well as different expectations about the distribution of certain grade (modernizing) and clade (regional, such as African, North Asian, etc.) features in the human fossil record. Using the prehistoric skeletal data of Australasia, North Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Levant, the conflicting predictions of these two models are tested by evaluating evidence for the existence of transitional samples and the persistence of morphological and metric features over time and space. The differences between the ""Eve' and the multiregional evolution models are so profound it is impossible for both to be correct. These differences in theoretical expectations relate to the requirements of the Eve theory that a single source of all contemporary mtDNA variation exists and that this source is derived exclusively from a relatively recent African female (Eve). This article shows that while an extreme replacement interpretation is unsupportable, the mtDNA data can be reconciled with the fossil record within the context of multiregional evolution. -from Authors",,"archaeological evidence; Eve model; evolution; evolution model; fossil record; historical studies; hominid; human origin; multiregional model; palaeontological test; skeletal data",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027387147

To rectify this, we applied identical methods to equivalent evidence from two groups of extant higher primates for whom reliable molecular phylogenies are available, the hominoids and papionins. We found that the phylogenetic hypotheses based on the craniodental data were incompatible with the molecular phylogenies for the groups. Given the robustness of the molecular phylogenies, these results indicate that little confidence can be placed in phylogenies generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence.

The dome has yielded nearly 80 Homo erectus fossils, around 50 of which have known findspots. With a hornblende 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 1.66 ± 0.04 mega-annum (Ma) reportedly associated with two fossils [Swisher, C.C., III, Curtis, G. H., Jacob, T., Getty, A. G., Suprijo, A. &amp; Widiasmoro (1994) Science 263, 1118-1121), the dome offers evidence that early Homo dispersed to East Asia during the earliest Pleistocene. Unfortunately, the hornblende pumice was sampled at Jokotingkir Hill, a central locality with complex lithostratigraphic deformation and dubious specimen provenance. To address the antiquity of Sangiran H. erectus more systematically, we investigate the sedimentary framework and hornblende 40Ar/ 39Ar age for volcanic deposits in the southeast quadrant of the dome. In this sector, Bapang (Kabuh) sediments have their largest exposure, least deformation, and most complete tephrostratigraphy. At five locations, we identify a sequence of sedimentary cycles in which H. erectus fossils are associated with epiclastic pumice. From sampled pumice, eight hornblende separates produced 40Ar/ 39Ar plateau ages ranging from 1.51 ± 0.08 Ma at the Bapang/ Sangiran Formation contact, to 1.02 ± 0.06 Ma, at a point above the hominin-bearing sequence. The chronological sequence of 40Ar/ 39Ar ages follows stratigraphic order across the southeast quadrant. An intermediate level yielding four nearly complete crania has an age of about 1.25 Ma.","Geochronology; Homo erectus; Human evolution; Southeast Asia; Tephrostratigraphy","article; evolution; fossil; Indonesia; priority journal; sediment; volcanic ash; animal; fossil; geography; history; hominid; human; time; Crania; Homo erectus; argon; isotope; radioisotope; Animals; Argon; Fossils; Geography; Geologic Sediments; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Indonesia; Isotopes; Radioisotopes; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035942101

Earlier analyses of this speleothem by TIMS (thermal-ionization mass-spectrometry) showed the lower part to be indistinguishable from internal isotopic equilibrium at the precision of the TIMS instrumentation used, yielding minimum age of 350 kyr (kyr = 103 yr before present). Reanalysis of six samples of SRA-3 by inductively-coupled plasma-multicollector mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) produced high-precision analytical results allowing calculation of finite dates. The new dates cluster around 600 kyr. A conservative conclusion takes the lower error limit ages as the minimum age of the speleothem, or 530 kyr.

However, evidence has been sufficient only in the past decade to overcome the conventional wisdom that hominins had been restricted to Africa until about 800,000 years ago. Indeed, the idea that hominin dispersal was technologically mediated, and thus must correlate with changes in stone tool technology seen at the Olduwan/Acheulean transition, has proven to be a persuasive hypothesis despite persistent claims for an early Pleistocene hominin presence outside Africa. We review multiple recent lines of evidence that suggest hominin dispersals from Africa in the earliest Pleistocene, if not the latest Pliocene, correlated with the appearance of hominins typically referred to as Homo erectus (sensu lato) who carried with them an Oldowan tool technology. Changes in body plan and foraging strategy are likely to ultimately underlie these dispersals. Copyright © 2004 by Annual Reviews.

Given geometric computer models of anatomical shapes for some collection of specimens - here the skulls of the some of the extant members of a family of monkeys - an evolutionary tree for the group implies a hypothesis about the way in which the shape changed through time. We use a statistical model which expresses the value of some continuous variable at an internal point in the tree as a weighted average of the values at the leaves. The framework of geometric morphometrics can then be used to define a shape-space, based on the correspondences of landmark points on the surfaces, within which these weighted averages can be realized as actual surfaces. Our software provides tools for performing and visualizing such an analysis in three dimensions. Beginning with laser range scans of crania, we use our landmark editor to interactively place landmark points on the surface. We use these to compute a ""tree-morph"" that smoothly interpolates the shapes across the tree. Each intermediate shape in the morph is a linear combination of all of the input surfaces. We create a surface model for an intermediate shape by warping all the input meshes towards the correct shape and then blending them together. To do the blending, we compute a weighted average of their associated trivariate distance functions and then extract a surface from the resulting function. We implement this idea using the squared distance function, rather than the usual signed distance function, in a novel way.","Distance fields; Extremal surface; Merging; Morphing; Morphometrics; Surface blending; Warping","Distance fields; Extremal surface; Morphing; Morphometrics; Surface blending; Warping; Computational geometry; Function evaluation; Linear equations; Mathematical models; Merging; Statistical methods; Computer graphics",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749447146

While there is considerable comparative evidence to support this idea, most experimental tests of this hypothesis have been on non-human primates or other very prognathic mammals (rodents, swine) raised on hard versus very soft (nearly liquid) diets. Here, we examine facial growth and in vivo strains generated in response to raw/dried foods versus cooked foods in a retrognathic mammal, the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis). The results indicate that the hyrax cranium resembles the non-human primate cranium in having a steep gradient of strains from the occlusal to orbital regions, but differs from most non-anthropoids in being primarily twisted; the hyrax mandible is bent both vertically and laterally. In general, higher strains, as much as two-fold at some sites, are generated by masticating raw versus cooked food. Hyraxes raised on cooked food had significantly less growth (approximately 10%) in the ventral (inferior) and posterior portions of the face, where strains are highest, resembling many of the differences evident between humans raised on highly processed versus less processed diets. The results support the hypothesis that food processing techniques have led to decreased facial growth in the mandibular and maxillary arches in recent human populations. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This is critical for understanding whether differences in the pattern of brain development might underlie potential cognitive differences between these two closely related groups. Previous comparisons of Neanderthal and modern human cranial development have shown that many morphological characteristics separating these two groups are already established at the time of birth [3-5], and that the subsequent developmental patterns of the face are similar, though not identical [6].

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549154351

Together with previously reported U-series dating of speleothem calcite and palaeomagnetic stratigraphy, as well as sedimentological considerations, these layers may be further correlated to S6-S7 in Chinese loess stratigraphy or marine isotope stages (MIS) 17-19, in the range of ∼0.68 to 0.78 Myr ago.

Many studies of human populations have applied the isolation-by-distance model to genetic variation between local populations in a limited geographic area, but few have done so on a global level, and these few used different models and analytical methods. I assess genetic variation between human populations across the world using data on red blood cell polymorphisms, microsatellite DNA markers, and craniometric traits. The isolation-by-distance model provides an excellent fit to average levels of genetic similarity within geographic distance classes for all three data sets, and the rate of distance decay is the same in all three. These results suggest that a common pattern of global gene flow mediated by geographic distance is detectable in diverse genetic and morphological data.

Based on these new data and reinterpretation of older information, three models have been offered to explain the development of modern people. These models—Bräuer's Afro‐European sapiens hypothesis, Stringer and Andrew's recent African evolution model, and Wolpoff, Wu, and Thorne's multiregional evolution model—have their roots in earlier models but differ from most by virtue of their worldwide perspective and integration of genetic and paleoanthropological data pertinent to modern human origins. This review presents a detailed discussion of these data in light of the three models. While convincing arguments can be offered for each of these models, it is concluded that none are unequivocally supported by the available data.

Two of the most pressing problems are redundancy of traits due to similarity of underlying function and overrepresentation of some anatomical or functional systems in trait lists. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, we collapse our list of 77 traits into sets of traits using two methods. The first method segregates traits into seven groups by anatomical region. The second method segregates traits by function into five complexes which correspond fairly well with recognized trends in the evolution of early hominids (adaptation for heavy chewing, reduction of the anterior dentition, basicranial flexion, increased orthognathism and encephalization). The most parsimonious cladogram describing the relationships among the early hominid species obtained using the original 77 traits or the summary scores from the functional complexes, places Australopithecus afarensis as a sister group to all other hominids. Australopithecus aethiopicus occupies the next branch, leaving A. africanus, A. robustus, A. boisei and Homo as a monophyletic group. The cladogram next separates A. africanus from the remaining hominids and finally divides Homo from A. robustus and A. boisei. Summary scores for anatomical regions produced three equally parsimonious cladograms, one of which was identical to that described above. This result implies that there was a large amount of parallelism in hominid evolution, and that adaptations for heavy chewing evolved separately in the lineage leading to A. aethiopicus and in the lineage leading to A. robustus and A. boisei. Another implication is that Homo descended from an A. africanus-like ancestor and diverged from A. robustus and A. boisei relatively late in hominid evolution by reducing the extent of its adaptation to heavy chewing. Most current phylogenies are not compatible with the cladogram obtained in this study, but are instead compatible with a cladogram obtained when traits related to heavy chewing are used exclusively. The ""heavy chewing"" cladogram reverses the positions of A. aethiopicus and Homo. Perhaps the reason why most current cladograms resemble the ""heavy chewing"" cladogram is the over-representation of traits related to heavy chewing in most trait lists. © 1992.","Australopithecus; cladistics; functional complexes; Homo; phylogenetic analysis; Plio-Pleistocene hominids","Australopithecus; cladistic analysis; evolution; hominid; Homo",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027062347

Recent consensus views cranial morphology as largely indicative of population history in humans, with some anatomical cranial regions/measurements being more informative on population history, while others being under selection pressure. We test earlier findings using the largest and most diverse cranial dataset available as yet: 7,423 male specimens from 135 geographic human population samples represented by 33 standard craniometric linear measurements. We calculated Mahalanobis D 2 for three datasets: complete cranial dataset; facial measurement dataset; and neurocranial measurement dataset; these morphological distance matrices were then compared to matrices of geographic distances as well as of several climatic variables. Additionally, we calculated Fst values for our cranial measurements and compared the results to the expected Fst values for neutral genetic loci. Our findings support the hypothesis that cranial, and especially neurocranial morphology, is phylogenetically informative, and that aspects of the face and cranium are subject to selection related to climatic factors. The Fst analysis suggest that selection to climate is largely restricted to groups living in extremely cold environments, including Northeast Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, though each of these regions appears to have arrived at their morphology through distinct adaptive pathways. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adaptation; Craniometrics; Fst; Human variation; Neanderthals; Population history","anatomical variation; article; climate; controlled study; data base; geography; human; human tissue; male; morphology; phylogeny; population; population differentiation; priority journal; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Asia; Cephalometry; Climate; Cold Climate; Europe; Evolution; Facial Bones; Fossils; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Male; North America; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Population; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449643229

This consensus has emerged in the last two decades, as molecular evidence has been coupled with findings from paleontology and prehistory. Patterns of DNA variation in living populations, morphology of fossils, and archeological traces can all be read to show that our species has deep roots in Africa and began to disperse into other regions only late in the Pleistocene. There are still questions about the timing of these dispersals and the extent to which modern people replaced or exchanged genes with other, more archaic groups, but new problems are now coming more clearly into focus. These relate to the ancestry of Homo sapiens in the Middle Pleistocene. In this essay, I emphasize the evidence available from Middle Pleistocene localities in Africa and Europe, exploring variation among individuals, composition of hypodigms, species-level taxonomy, and evolutionary relationships of the hominin populations. One obvious difficulty is that the fossils are scarce. For the most part, only incomplete crania are available from African localities. The record is more comprehensive for the Sima de los Huesos in Spain, but principally crania and jaws are known from other European sites. This means that skull traits and measurements must provide the basis for sorting individuals to groups and building differential diagnoses. For much of the material, dating is still poorly controlled, although a few of the most important assemblages can now be placed more securely within a Middle Pleistocene chronological framework. Despite these constraints, it is possible to point toward tentative solutions.","Cranial form; Homo heidelbergensis; Human evolution; Neanderthals; Phylogeny; Systematics","Crania; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549141344

However, they exhibit a variable suite of features that are either distinctive Neandertal traits and/or plesiomorphic (ancestral) aspects that had been lost among the African Middle Paleolithic modern humans. These features include aspects of neurocranial shape, basicranial external morphology, mandibular ramal and symphyseal form, dental morphology and size, and anteroposterior dental proportions, as well as aspects of the clavicles, scapulae, metacarpals, and appendicular proportions. The ubiquitous and variable presence of these morphological features in the European earlier modern human samples can only be parsimoniously explained as a product of modest levels of assimilation of Neandertals into early modern human populations as the latter dispersed across Europe.

Hitherto, this has contrasted with the situation in China where no unequivocal specimens of this species have been securely dated to more than 30 ka. Here we present the results of stratigraphic studies and U-series dating of the Tongtianyan Cave, the discovery site of the Liujiang hominid, which represents one of the few well-preserved fossils of modern Homo sapiens in China. The human fossils are inferred to come from either a refilling breccia or a primarily deposited gravel-bearing sandy clay layer. In the former case, which is better supported, the fossils would date to at least ∼ 68 ka, but more likely to ∼ 111-139 ka. Alternatively, they would be older than ∼ 153 ka. Both scenarios would make the Liujiang hominid one of the earliest modern humans in East Asia, possibly contemporaneous with the earliest known representatives from the Levant and Africa. Parallel studies on other Chinese localities have provided supporting evidence for the redating of Liujiang, which may have important implications for the origin of modern humans. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This nomen, formulated by Schoetensack in 1908 to describe the Mauer jaw (Germany), was almost forgotten during most of the past century. Numerous fossils have been attributed to it but no consensus has arisen concerning their classification. The holotype anatomical traits are still poorly understood, and numerous fossils with no mandibular remains have been placed in the taxon. Some researchers propose H. heidelbergensis as an Afro-European taxon that is ancestral to both modern humans and Neandertals whereas others think it is a strictly European species that is part of the Neandertal lineage. We focus on the validity of H. heidelbergensis, using the traditional basis of species recognition: anatomical description. We provide a comparative morphological analysis using 47 anatomical traits of 36 Pleistocene fossils from Africa, Asia, and Europe and 35 extant human mandibles. We re-examine the mandibular features of Mauer and discuss the specimen's inclusion in H. heidelbergensis, as well as alternative evolutionary theories. To lend objectivity to specimen grouping, we use multiple correspondence analysis associated with hierarchical classification that creates clusters corresponding to phenetic similarities between jaws. Our phenetic and comparative morphological analyses support the validity of H. heidelbergensis as a taxon. A set of morphological features can be statistically identified for the definition of the species. Some traits can be used to delimit H. heidelbergensis in an evolutionary framework (e.g., foramina mentale posteriorly positioned, horizontal retromolar surface). Those traits are also present on African (e.g., Tighenif) and European (e.g., Sima de los Huesos) specimens that show a close relationship with the Mauer mandible. Therefore, the definition of H. heidelbergensis is more precise and mainly supports the theory of an Afro-European taxon, which is the last common ancestor of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens.

Features of the crania of Neandertals could be adaptations to the glacial climate of Pleistocene Europe or to the high mechanical strains produced by habitually using the front teeth as tools, while those of modern humans could be adaptations for articulate speech production. A few researchers have proposed non-adaptive explanations. These stress that isolation between Neandertal and modern human populations would have lead to cranial diversification by genetic drift (chance changes in the frequencies of alleles at genetic loci contributing to variation in cranial morphology). Here we use a variety of statistical tests founded on explicit predictions from quantitative- and population-genetic theory to show that genetic drift can explain cranial differences between Neandertals and modern humans. These tests are based on thirty-seven standard cranial measurements from a sample of 2524 modern humans from 30 populations and 20 Neandertal fossils. As a further test, we compare our results for modern human cranial measurements with those for a genetic dataset consisting of 377 microsatellites typed for a sample of 1056 modern humans from 52 populations. We conclude that rather than requiring special adaptive accounts, Neandertal and modern human crania may simply represent two outcomes from a vast space of random evolutionary possibilities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The specimen consists of two complete parietals, most of the right temporal, and 70% of the occipital. The specimen displays several features characteristic of early 'archaic' Homo sapiens: maximum breadth at the supramastoid crests, roughly pentagonal occipital view, an angular torus, superoinferiorly elongate/anteroposterior shortened aquamous temporal, strong masteroid, and separation of the tympanic and mastoid temporal portions. Other features align the Reilingen cranium with the 'classic' Neandertals: developed suprainiac fossa, bilaterally protuberant occipital torus, strong juxtamastoid eminence, a highly convex occipital plane, and lambdoid flattening. This morphology and our cephalometric analysis support the assignment of this specimen to a Stage 2 'pre-Neandertal' group (e.g., Steinheim, Swanscombe, and Atapuerca [SH site]). Following an 'Accretion Model' of European hominid evolution, Stage 2 succeeds Strage 1 European 'early-pre-Neandertals' (e.g., Mauer and Petralona), and precedes both the Saale-Eem Stage 3 'early Neandertals' (e.g., Biache 1), which present greater platycephaly, a reduced mastoid process, an enlarged juxtamastoid eminence, and true 'en-bombe' (parieto-occipital form), and Weichsel Stage 4 'Neandertals' (sensu stricto, i.e., 'classic' Neadertals).",,"evolution; Homo sapiens; Neanderthal; phylogeny; Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany; Reilingen; Animalia; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032071342

Yet variation within Asian H. erectus and its relation to ecological and temporal parameters have been little studied. I synthesize the revised radiometric chronologies for hominid sites in Asia and their relation to new oxygen isotope curves (proxies for climatic fluctuations and landbridge connections). These data suggest substantial opportunities in the later Pleistocene for both regional isolation and gene flow between hominids in mainland and Southeast Asia. They also suggest that the most northerly located Chinese sites (Zhoukoudian and Nanjing) may have been occupied during sequential, interglacial periods. Probably reflecting these periods of isolation, nonmetric features and principal components analysis (PCA) of calvarial shape suggest regional differentiation between northern Asian and Southeast Asian H. erectus. The most recent Southeast Asian fossils (e.g., Ngandong) conform to the Southeast Asian pattern. Except perhaps in brain size, there is no evidence that the temporally intermediate Chinese fossils are intermediate in morphology between older and younger Indonesian fossils. In fact, northern Chinese calvaria are easier to exclude from the larger Asian H. erectus hypodigm than are the Ngandong fossils. The Chinese specimens differ from the others based on their narrower occipitals and frontals for their cranial size. The Chinese sample from Zhoukoudian alone is thus not a good proxy for the morphology and variation seen within Asian H. erectus. Both the Chinese and late Indonesian samples exhibit less variation than does the early Indonesian sample; this along with their shared morphological bauplan suggests a common origin and no more than subspecific differentiation. This shared morphology, despite regional differences, was likely maintained by the increasing intensity of multiple glaciations (and longerlasting land bridge connections) between mainland and island Southeast Asia during the last million years. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","18O record; China; H. ergaster; Indonesia","article; Asia; calvaria; China; chronology; fossil; geographic distribution; human; physical anthropology; radiometry; skull; Southeast Asia; Animals; Cephalometry; China; Evolution; Hominidae; Humans; Indonesia; Paleontology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036321651

In turn, this has led to suggestions that the temporal bone is particularly reliable in analyses of primate phylogeny and human population history. While several reasons have been suggested to explain the temporal bone's strong fit with neutral expectation, the temporal bone has never systematically been compared against other individual cranial bones defined using the same biological criteria. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the shapes of all cranial bones possess reliable information regarding neutral genetic evolution, or whether the temporal bone is unique in this respect. This study tests the hypothesis that the human temporal bone is more congruent with neutral expectation than six other individual cranial bones by correlating population affinity matrices generated using neutral genetic and 3D craniometric data. The results demonstrate that while the temporal bone shows the absolute strongest correlation with neutral genetic data compared with all other bones, it is not statistically differentiated from the sphenoid, frontal, and parietal bones in this regard. Potential reasons for the temporal bone's consistently strong fit with neutral expectation, such as its overall anatomical complexity and/or its contribution to the architecture of the basicranium, are examined.

In fact despite various claims to the contrary, there continues to be valid scientific debate about the interpretation of patterns from all of these disciplinary domains and which models they are more commensurate with. The assessment presented here concludes that the assimilation model is the best explanation for the origin of anatomically modern humans in Europe.

It encompasses the posterior projection/convexity of the occipital squama and is associated with lambdoid flattening on the parietal. A 'hemibun' in some Upper Paleolithic Europeans is thought by some authors to indicate interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern Europeans. However, 'bunning' is difficult to measure, and the term has been applied to a range of morphological patterns. Furthermore, its usefulness in phylogenetic reconstruction and its homologous status across modern and fossil humans have been disputed. We present a geometric morphometric study that quantitatively evaluates the chignon, assesses its usefulness in separating Neanderthals from modern humans, and its degree of similarity to Upper Paleolithic 'hemibuns.' We measured the three-dimensional coordinates of closely spaced points along the midsagittal plane from bregma to inion and of anatomical landmarks in a large series of recent human crania and several Middle and Late Pleistocene European and African fossils. These coordinate data were processed using the techniques of geometric morphometrics and analyzed with relative warps, canonical variates, and singular warps. Our results show no separation between Neanderthals and modern humans, including early modern Europeans, when the shape of the occipital plane midsagittal-profile is considered alone. On the other hand, Neanderthals are well separated from both recent and fossil modern humans when information about the occipital's relative position and relative size are also included. Furthermore, the occurrence of a highly convex and posteriorly projecting midline occipital profile (interpreted as the occipital bun) is highly correlated (>0.8) with a flat parietal midsagittal profile and with antero-superiorly positioned temporal bones across both our recent and our fossil human samples. We conclude that the shape of the occipital profile alone should not be considered an independent trait, as it is very tightly integrated with braincase shape. Our analysis does not support differences in integration of the posterior midsagittal profile and the cranial base in Pleistocene and recent humans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assessed the phylogenetic utility of six different human cranial regions, plus the entire cranium. Three-dimensional landmark data were collected for 83 landmarks from samples of skulls from 14 modern human populations. The data were subsequently divided into anatomical regions: basicranium, upper face, mandible, temporal bone, upper jaw, cranial vault, and a subset of points from around the entire cranium. Depictions of population molecular distances were calculated using published data on microsatellites for the same or closely related populations. Distances based on morphological variation of each of the anatomical regions were compared with molecular distances, and the correlations assessed. The morphology of the basicranium, temporal bone, upper face, and entire cranium demonstrated the highest correlations with molecular distances. The morphology of the mandible, upper jaw, and cranial vault, as measured here, were not significantly correlated with molecular distances. As the three-dimensional morphology of the temporal bone, upper face, basicranium, and entire cranium appear to consistently reflect genetic relationships in humans, especially with more reliability than the cranial vault, it would be preferable to focus on these regions when attempting to determine the genetic relationships of human specimens with no molecular data. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"anatomical variation; article; craniofacial morphology; epigenetics; human; maxilla; microsatellite marker; molecular biology; morphological trait; phylogeny; physical anthropology; population genetics; priority journal; reliability; temporal bone; three dimensional imaging; Anthropology, Physical; Continental Population Groups; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Humans; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-59549091063

Additional examples are provided from an ongoing study of global craniometric variation.

We suggest how developmental and functional criteria can be used to predict where in the skeleton of fossil hominins we should expect more, or less, within-species variation. We present and test three hypotheses about the factors contributing to craniodental variation in extant primate taxa, and then apply these results to the interpretation of the P. boisei hypodigm. Within the comparative samples of extant Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Colobus, variables from the cranial base, neurocranium, and face that are not subject to high magnitudes of strain have consistently lower levels of intraspecific variation than variables from regions of the face subject to high levels of strain. Dental size variables are intermediate in terms of their reliability. P. boisei is found to have a low degree of variability relative to extant primates for variables shown to be generally useful for testing taxonomic hypotheses. Contrary to the claims of Suwa et al. ([1997] Nature 389:489-492), the recently discovered material from Konso falls within the range of variation of the ""pre-Konso"" hypodigm of P. boisei for available conventional metrical variables. Those aspects of the Konso material that appear to extend the range of the P. boisei hypodigm involve regions of the skull predicted to be prone to high levels of within-species variation.

Alternatively, a new species - ancestral to later European and African hominines - should be named to accommodate such a unique fossil specimen.",,"article; calvaria; Europe; fossil; hominid; human; Italy; morphometrics; phylogeny; priority journal; skull; Animals; Cephalometry; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Italy; Multivariate Analysis; Phylogeny; Skull; Hominidae; Homo antecessor; Homo ergaster; Homo heidelbergensis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035859930

We present a comparison of the expression of lower molar dental traits (cusp 6, cusp 7, trigonid crest pattern, and protostylid) at the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) in a variety of extant and fossil hominoid taxa, in order to assess the contribution of the EDJ to the morphology of these traits at the outer enamel surface (OES). Molars (n = 44) were imaged nondestructively using high-resolution microCT, and three-dimensional surface models of the EDJ and OES were created to compare trait expression at each surface. Our results indicate that these dental traits originate at the EDJ, and that the EDJ is primarily responsible for their degree of expression at the OES. Importantly, variable trait morphology at the EDJ (often not easily recognizable at the OES) indicates that different developmental processes can produce traits that appear similar at the enamel surface, suggesting caution in intra- and intertaxonomic comparisons. The results also highlight the importance of the EDJ for understanding the morphological development of discrete traits, and for establishing graded scales of variation to compare trait frequency among groups for the purpose of taxonomic and/or phylogenetic analysis.

All of the human fossils are assigned to the Acheulo-Yabrudian Cultural Complex (AYCC) of the late Lower Paleolithic. The Middle Pleistocene age of the Qesem teeth (400-200 ka) places them chronologically earlier than the bulk of fossil hominin specimens previously known from southwest Asia. Three permanent mandibular teeth (C1-P4) were found in close proximity in the lower part of the stratigraphic sequence. The small metric dimensions of the crowns indicate a considerable degree of dental reduction although the roots are long and robust. In contrast, three isolated permanent maxillary teeth (I2, C1, and M3) and two isolated deciduous teeth that were found within the upper part of the sequence are much larger and show some plesiomorphous traits similar to those of the Skhul/Qafzeh specimens. Although none of the Qesem teeth shows a suite of Neanderthal characters, a few traits may suggest some affinities with members of the Neanderthal evolutionary lineage.

Three explanations have dominated debates about the meaning of Neandertal cranial features: climatic adaptation, anterior dental loading, and genetic drift. Neither climatic adaptation nor anterior dental loading are well supported, but genetic drift is consistent with the available evidence. Climatic adaptation and activity patterns are the most discussed explanations for Neandertal postcranial features. Robust empirical relationships between climate and body form in extant humans and other endotherms currently make climatic adaptation the most plausible explanation for the wide bodies and relatively short limbs of Neandertals, and many additional postcranial features are likely secondary consequences of these overall skeletal proportions. Activity patterns may explain certain Neandertal postcranial features, but unlike the situation for climate, relationships in extant humans between morphology and activities are typically not well established. For both the cranium and the postcranium, changes in diet or activity patterns may underlie why Neandertals and Pleistocene modern humans tend to be more robust than Holocene humans.","Cranium; Human evolution; Modern human origins; Postcranium","bone development; bone structure; cold climate; evolution; fossil human; gene flow; gene mutation; genetic difference; genetic drift; human; natural selection; nonhuman; priority journal; review; skull development; Africa; animal; article; bone; classification; Europe; fossil; histology; hominid; methodology; physical anthropology; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Bone and Bones; Europe; Evolution; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349507632

Some workers consider this fossil human group to represent a different species. Homo neanderthalensis, while others see it as a subspecies of Homo sapiens. This study developed two models of morphological variation to be applied to a comparison between Neanderthals and modern humans: modern human populations provided a measure of intra-specific variation, while the species and subspecies of Pan provided measures of both intra- and inter-specific morphological differences. Although such an approach has been advocated strongly, it has not been systematically undertaken until recently. The techniques of geometric morphometrics were used to collect data in the form of three-dimensional coordinates of craniofacial landmarks. The data were processed using generalized procrustes analysis, and analyzed by an array of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components analysis, canonical variates analysis and Mahalanobis D2. The morphological distances between Neanderthals and modern humans, and between Neanderthals and Late Paleolithic/early anatomically modern specimens, are consistently greater than the distances among recent human populations, and greater than the distances between the two chimpanzee species. Furthermore, no strong morphological similarities were found between Neanderthals and Late Paleolithic Europeans.

Most of these, however, are difficult to measure and are usually described qualitatively. This study applied the techniques of geometric morphometrics to the complex morphology of the temporal bone, in order to quantify the differences observed between Neanderthal and modern human anatomy. Two hundred and seventy modern human crania were measured, representing 9 populations of 30 individuals each, and spanning the extremes of the modern human geographical range. Twelve Neanderthal specimens, as well as Reilingen, Kabwe, Skhul 5, Qafzeh 9, and 4 Late Paleolithic European specimens, were included in the fossil sample. The data were collected in the form of three-dimensional (3-D) landmark coordinates, and specimen configurations were superimposed using generalized Procrustes analysis. The fitted coordinates were then analyzed by an array of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components analysis, canonical variates analysis, and Mahalanobis D2. The temporal bone landmark analysis was very successful in separating Neanderthals from modern humans. Neanderthals were separated from modern humans in both the principal components and canonical variates analyses. They were much further in Mahalanobis distances from all modern human populations than any two modern human groups were from each other.

To gain further resolution regarding this debate, 3D geometric morphometric data were used to quantify overall shape variation in the cranial vault within H. erectus using a new metric, the sum of squared pairwise Procrustes distances (SSD). Bootstrapping methods were used to compare the H. erectus SSD to a broad range of human and nonhuman primate samples in order to ascertain whether variation in H. erectus most clearly resembles that seen in one or more species. The reference taxa included relevant phylogenetic, ecological, and temporal analogs including humans, apes, and both extant and extinct papionin monkeys. The mean cranial shapes of different temporogeographic subsets of H. erectus fossils were then tested for significance using exact randomization tests and compared to the distances between regional groups of modern humans and subspecies/species of the ape and papionin monkey taxa. To gauge the influence of sexual dimorphism on levels of variation, comparisons were also made between the mean cranial shapes of single-sex samples for the reference taxa. Results indicate that variation in H. erectus is most comparable to single species of papionin monkeys and the genus Pan, which included two species. However, H. erectus encompasses a limited range of variation given its extensive geographic and temporal range, leading to the conclusion that only one species should be recognized. In addition, there are significant differences between the African/Georgian and Asian H. erectus samples, but not between H. ergaster (Georgia + Africa, excluding OH 9 and Daka) and H. erectus sensu stricto. This finding is in line with expectations for intraspecific variation in a long-lived species with a wide, but probably discontinuous, geographic distribution. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Natural selection alone cannot explain similarities between patterns of cranial and molecular diversity observed in humans. It appears that the amount of phenotypic variance in the human cranium decreases at the population level as a function of distance from Sub-Saharan Africa much in the same way as observed for human molecular data.(1). © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Africa; article; evolution; gene mutation; genetic drift; genetic variability; geographic distribution; morphology; natural selection; phenotype; skull; Africa; Evolution; Humans; Models, Biological; Phenotype; Skull; Variation (Genetics); Crania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-36849002327

Such early Middle Pleistocene hominins were not anatomically modern. Their skulls display strong supraorbital tori above projecting faces, flattened frontals, and less parietal expansion than is the case for Homo sapiens. Postcranial remains seem also to have archaic features. Subsequently, some groups evolved advanced skeletal morphology, and by ca. 200,000 years ago, individuals more similar to recent humans are present in the African record. These fossils are associated with Middle Stone Age lithic assemblages and, in some cases, Acheulean tools. Crania from Herto in Ethiopia carry defleshing cutmarks and superficial scoring that may be indicative of mortuary practices. Despite these signs of behavioral innovation, neither the Herto hominins, nor others from Late Pleistocene sites such as Klasies River in southern Africa and Skhūl/Qafzeh in Israel, can be matched in living populations. Skulls are quite robust, and it is only after ≈35,000 years ago that people with more gracile, fully modern morphology make their appearance. Not surprisingly, many questions concerning this evolutionary history have been raised. Attention has centered on systematics of the mid-Pleistocene hominins, their paleobiology, and the timing of dispersals that spread H. sapiens out of Africa and across the Old World. In this report, I discuss structural changes characterizing the skulls from different time periods, possible regional differences in morphology, and the bearing of this evidence on recognizing distinct species.","Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Human evolution; Skull morphology; Systematics","Africa; anatomical variation; bone structure; brain size; evolution; fossil hominid; hominid; Homo heidelbergensis; homo sapiens; human; Middle Pleistocene; Pleistocene; posthumous care; priority journal; review; skeleton; skull base; South Asia; Upper Pleistocene; animal; article; Asia; bone; brain; classification; face; fossil; histology; methodology; physical anthropology; population dynamics; skull; time; Crania; Homo erectus; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Africa; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Asia; Bone and Bones; Brain; Evolution; Face; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Population Dynamics; Skull; Time Factors",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349519050

While human craniometric and genetic data fit a model of isolation by geographic distance, it is not yet clear whether this is due to geographically mediated gene flow or human dispersal events. Recently, human genetic data have been shown to fit an iterative founder effect model of dispersal with an African origin, in line with the out-of-Africa replacement model for modern human origins, and Manica et al. (Nature 448 (2007) 346-349) have demonstrated that human craniometric data also fit this model. However, in contrast with the neutral model of cranial evolution suggested by previous studies, Manica et al. (2007) made the a priori assumption that cranial form has been subject to climatically driven natural selection and therefore correct for climate prior to conducting their analyses. Here we employ a modified theoretical and methodological approach to test whether human cranial variability fits the iterative founder effect model. In contrast with Manica et al. (2007) we employ size-adjusted craniometric variables, since climatic factors such as temperature have been shown to correlate with aspects of cranial size. Despite these differences, we obtain similar results to those of Manica et al. (2007), with up to 26% of global within-population craniometric variation being explained by geographic distance from sub-Saharan Africa. Comparative analyses using non-African origins do not yield significant results. The implications of these results are discussed in the light of the modern human origins debate. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cranial diversity; Iterative founder effect model; Modern human origins; Within-group variance","Africa; anatomical variation; anthropometric parameters; article; craniofacial morphology; human; human tissue; methodology; model; natural selection; physical anthropology; skull; temperature; theory; biological model; cephalometry; genetic variability; population genetics; Africa; Cephalometry; Genetics, Population; Humans; Models, Genetic; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-42149126720

The result was a very large spread of dates particularly on bone samples. Amid the large spread of results, some radiometric data on speleothems showed a convergence in agreement with inferences from faunal studies. We present new U-series results on the stalagmitic formation located at the bottom of Unit IV (at the base of the Upper Stratigraphic Complex). Samples and splits were collaboratively analyzed in the four different laboratories with excellent interlaboratory agreement. Results show the complex sequence of this stalagmitic formation.

Specialized characters displayed by the Indonesian and Chinese skulls are said to be absent in material from eastern Africa, and individuals from Koobi Fora and Nariokotome are now referred by some workers to H. ergaster. This second species is held to be the ancestor from which later human populations are derived. The claim for two taxa is evaluated here with special reference to the facial skeleton. Asian fossils examined include Sangiran 4 and Sangiran 17, several of the Ngandong crania, Gongwangling, and of course the material from Zhoukoudian described by Weidenreich ([1943] Palaeontol. Sin. [New Ser. D] 10:1-484). African specimens compared are KNM-ER 3733 and KNM- ER 3883 from Koobi Fora and KNM-WT 15000 from Nariokotome. Hominid 9 from Olduvai is useful only insofar as the brows and interorbital pillar are preserved. Neither detailed anatomical comparisons nor measurements bring to light any consistent patterns in facial morphology which set the African hominids apart from Asian H. erectus. Faces of the African individuals do tend to be high and less broad across the orbits. Both of the Koobi Fora crania but not KNM-WT 15000 have nasal bones that are narrow superiorly, while the piriform aperture is relatively wide. In many other characters, including contour of the supraorbital torus, glabellar prominence, nasal bridge dimensions, internasal keeling, anatomy of the nasal sill and floor, development of the canine jugum, orientation of the zygomaticoalveolar pillar, rounding of the anterolateral surface of the cheek, formation of a malar tubercle, and palatal rugosity, there is variation among individuals from localities within the major geographic provinces. Here it is not possible to identify features that are unique to either the Asian or African assemblages. Additional traits such as a forward sloping 'crista nasalis,' presence of a 'sulcus maxillaris,' a high (and massive) cheek coupled with some flexion of the malar pillar, and a posterior position for the incisive canal are present in all groups. These characters seem to be plesiomorphic, in comparison to the derived states evolved in later humans. Much or all of the variation in facial form can be attributed to sex dimorphism and/or local differentiation of populations within the Asian and African geographic regions. Metric differences among the fossils are comparable to those documented in a subset of recent H. sapiens, and there is no evidence that the Pleistocene specimens show greater dispersion than expected within a single species. This finding is generally in keeping with observations made on other parts of the cranium, lower jaw, and teeth. All of the hominids can be placed in H. erectus. Although its phylogenetic origins remain obscure, this lineage must be rooted in Africa. The species flourished for a long time. At several sites in China, H. erectus is known from deposits of the later Middle Pleistocene, while at Ngandong in Indonesia, archaic people may have survived even into the Late Pleistocene (Swisher et al. [1996] Science 274:1870-1874). The Ngandong fossils may record the last appearance of the lineage.","Comparative anatomy; Human evolution; Pleistocene hominids; Species; Taxonomy","africa; article; asia; craniofacial morphology; evolution; face; fossil; hominid; human; sex difference; Africa; Animals; Asia; Evolution; Face; Facial Bones; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Sex Factors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031958648

Evidence for such admixture must be sought in the earliest fossil record of modern humans outside Africa, as it is those populations that would have encountered, and possibly interbred with, archaic hominins. In the case of Europe, the recent application of direct dating techniques has eliminated several specimens from the Upper Paleolithic fossil record, while confirming early ages for others. Among these earliest reliably dated specimens is the Cioclovina calvaria from Romania. This individual is of highest importance for the understanding of modern human origins in Europe, and has recently been proposed to represent a Neanderthal-modern human hybrid. We present a short description and a three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometric analysis of the Cioclovina specimen using a large geographic sample of recent humans, Neanderthals and Middle and Late Pleistocene fossil hominins from Europe, Africa, and the Levant, in order to establish its phenetic affinities and to evaluate its morphology for evidence of admixture between Neanderthals and early modern Europeans.

Several authors have noted broad resemblances between European and African fossils from this period, suggesting a single taxon ancestral to both modern humans and Neanderthals. Others point out 'incipient' Neanderthal features in the morphology of the European sample and have argued for their inclusion in the Neanderthal lineage exclusively, following a model of accretionary evolution of Neanderthals. We approach these questions using geometric morphometric methods which allow the intuitive visualization and quantification of features previously described qualitatively. We apply these techniques to evaluate proposed cranio-facial 'incipient' facial, vault, and basicranial traits in a middle-late Pleistocene European hominin sample when compared to a sample of the same time depth from Africa. Some of the features examined followed the predictions of the accretion model and relate the middle Pleistocene European material to the later Neanderthals. However, although our analysis showed a clear separation between Neanderthals and early/recent modern humans and morphological proximity between European specimens from OIS 7 to 3, it also shows that the European hominins from the first half of the middle Pleistocene still shared most of their cranio-facial architecture with their African contemporaries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Face; Geometric morphometrics; Homo heidelbergensis; Neanderthal; Occipital; Temporal","archaeology; cranium; fossil record; human evolution; morphometry; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; three-dimensional modeling; visualization; Homo heidelbergensis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958177900

Nonetheless, important gaps remain to this day in the map of Pleistocene Europe; perhaps the most glaring of these is located in the southeastern corner of the continent. This region's record is critical for addressing questions about the course of human evolution in Europe because its geographic position lends it a dual role: on one hand, it encompasses a frequently hypothesized dispersal corridor from Africa into Europe for both archaic and early modern humans; on the other, as one of the three Mediterranean peninsulas, it acted as a refugium for plant, animal, and, most likely, human populations during glacial conditions.

However, it has been suggested that different cranial regions preserve phylogenetic information differentially. Some parts of the face and neurocranium are thought to be relatively developmentally flexible, and therefore to be subject to the epigenetic influence of the environment. Other parts are thought to be particularly responsive to selection for adaptation to local climate. The basicranium, on the other hand, and in particular the temporal bone, is thought to be largely genetically determined and has been argued to preserve a strong phylogenetic signal with little possibility of homoplasy. Here we test the hypotheses that cranial morphology is related to population history among recent humans, and that different cranial regions reflect population history and local climate differentially. Morphological distances among ten recent human populations were calculated from the face, vault and temporal bone using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics methods. The distance matrices obtained were then compared to neutral genetic distances and to climatic differences among the same or closely matched groups. Results indicated a stronger relationship of the shape of the vault and the temporal bone with neutral genetic distances, and a stronger association of facial shape with climate. Vault and temporal bone centroid sizes were associated with climate and particularly temperature; facial centroid size was associated with genetic distances. Temporal bone shape was more successful in tracking older population history than vault shape. Of the three cranial regions, it is therefore most appropriate for phylogenetic reconstructions among fossil humans. Analysis of temporal bone shape of both recent and Middle-Late Pleistocene humans showed Neanderthals to be morphologically very distant from both recent and fossil modern humans, indicating that Neanderthals represent a distinct evolutionary lineage. © 2008 Springer.","Climate; Craniofacial morphology; Genetics; Neanderthals; Phylogeny; Population history",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937991635

This method seemed relatively straightforward and precise especially as new discoveries were fitted into the schemes, apparently strengthening the correlations and increasing their validity. However, recent studies of deep‐sea cores and terrestrial deposits, combined with new developments in relative and absolute dating, have shown that the fourfold schemes are oversimplified. This paper critically reviews some of the dating evidence from sites with hominid remains generally considered as Middle Pleistocene (ca. 700,000–128,000 BP). The hominid and archaeological remains are shown to require independent dating and a cautious approach is adopted towards the use of mammalian faunal remains as chronological indicators. The techniques and results of absolute dating are discussed with reference to present problems and future prospects. At a time of transition from an old framework to new correlations, it is inevitable that some conclusions seem tentative and others rather negative. Nevertheless, the Middle Pleistocene in Europe is more fully understood and better dated than the equivalent period in other parts of the world.

Moro 5, 00185 Roma, Italy","The discovery in 1994, of a fossilized human calvarium near Ceprano, Italy, dated about 800-900 thousand years before present, opened a new page for the study of human evolution in Europe. It extended the continental fossil record over the boundary between Early and Middle Pleistocene for the first time and revealed the cranial morphology of humans that where probably ancestral to both Neanderthals and modern Homo sapiens. A tomographic analysis of the Italian specimen is reported here in order to describe size and shape, vascular traces, and other features of the endocranium, as well as some relevant ectocranial traits (particularly of the frontal region). Our results show that the Ceprano calvarium displays plesiomorphies shared by early Homo taxa, involving a general archaic phenotype. At the same time, the presence of some derived features suggests a phylogenetic relationship with the populations referred to the subsequent polymorphic species H. keidelbergensis. The morphology of the supraorbital structures is different from the double-arched browridge of the African H. ergaster, while its superior shape shows similarities with African Middle Pleistocene specimens (Bodo, Kabwe). In contrast, the relationship between supraorbital torus and frontal squama points to an archaic pattern of the relationship between face and vault, associated to moderately narrow frontal lobes and limited development of the upper parietal areas. Despite a nonderived endocranial shape, the increase of cranial capacity (related to a general endocranial widening) and the probable absence of a clear occipital projection also suggest an evolutionary independence from the Asian H. erectus lineage. This analysis therefore supports the conclusion that the Ceprano calvarium represents the best available candidate for the ancestral phenotype of the cranial variation observed among Middle Pleistocene fossil samples in Africa and Europe.

In particular, the degree to which the three adult crania exhibit recent East Asian morphology, as well as their degree of within-group variability, has long been debated. Several early researchers described a resemblance to East Asian populations, but these findings have been for the most part rejected by more recent metric and non-metric analyses. Nevertheless, the Upper Cave specimens have not been classified conclusively into any recent modern human population to which they have been compared, and classification results differ for each cranium. Here, the question of the affinities of Upper Cave 101 and 103, the two better-preserved crania, is examined from the perspective of the Late Pleistocene human fossil record using the methodology of 3-D geometric morphometrics. The degree of morphological variation between the two specimens is also evaluated within the context of recent population variability. Neurocranial and facial morphology are analyzed separately so as to maximize comparative samples. Results show a morphological resemblance of the Upper Cave material to Upper Paleolithic Europeans. It is proposed that the Upper Cave specimens retain important aspects of modern human ancestral morphology, and possibly share a recent common ancestral population with Upper Paleolithic Europeans, in accordance with the Single Origin model of modern human origins. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This specimen is dated to the Middle Pleistocene (the latest estimate is between 250 and 350 kyr) and is associated with the Acheulo‐Yabrudian, which makes it the oldest cranium from the region. It has been previously regarded as a Neandertal, and early “anatomically modern Homo sapiens,” and a generalized specimen ancestral to both. These different phylogenetic interpretations of its features have a historic basis but in our view also result from a confusion of grade and intraspecies clade as valid sources of variation. We show here that generally the differences that distinguish Zuttiyeh from Neandertals are similarities it shares with the Zhoukoudian remains. These similarities involve a unique combination of features, and suggest the possibility of an ancestral relationship. It is less likely that Middle Pleistocene remains from Europe or sub‐Saharan Africa are uniquely or significantly ancestral to Zuttiyeh. An accurate understanding of the relationship between populations of eastern and western Asia is important for resolving the more general questions surrounding the position of the Upper Pleistocene Levant populations in human evolution, including (1) whether there are significantly different contemporary Mousterian populations in the Upper Pleistocene, (2) whether Neandertals are clearly intrusive in the region, and (3) whether there is an early appearance of (what many workers call) “anatomically modern Homo sapiens.” The hypothesis of a recent unique African ancestry for all modern humans is disproved by our study, which shows Asia as a significant source area for at least some living populations. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Nevertheless, the diagnosis and hypodigm of H. heidelbergensis still remain to be clarified. Here we evaluate the morphology of the incomplete cranium (calvarium) known as Ceprano whose age has been recently revised to the mid of the Middle Pleistocene, so as to test whether this specimen may be included in H. heidelbergensis. The analyses were performed according to a phenetic routine including geometric morphometrics and the evaluation of diagnostic discrete traits. The results strongly support the uniqueness of H. heidelbergensis on a wide geographical horizon, including both Eurasia and Africa.

Demographic expansion into new areas that took place during this period and the diffusion of burial practices resulted in an unprecedented number of well-preserved human remains. This skeletal record, dovetailed with archeological, environmental, and chronological contexts, allows testing of hypotheses regarding biological processes at the population level. In this article, we review key studies about the biology of Upper Paleolithic populations based primarily on European samples, but integrating information from other areas of the Old World whenever possible. Data about cranial morphology, skeletal robusticity, stature, body proportions, health status, diet, physical activity, and genetics are evaluated in Late Pleistocene climatic and cultural contexts. Various lines of evidence delineate the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) as a critical phase in the biological and cultural evolution of Upper Paleolithic populations. The LGM, a long phase of climatic deterioration culminating around 20,000 BP, had a profound impact on the environment, lifestyle, and behavior of human groups. Some of these effects are recorded in aspects of skeletal biology of these populations. Groups living before and after the LGM, Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) and Late Upper Paleolithic (LUP), respectively, differ significantly in craniofacial dimensions, stature, robusticity, and body proportions. While paleopathological and stable isotope data suggest good health status throughout the Upper Paleolithic, some stress indicators point to a slight decline in quality of life in LUP populations. The intriguing and unexpected incidence of individuals affected by congenital disorders probably indicates selective burial practices for these abnormal individuals. While some of the changes observed can be explained through models of biocultural or environmental adaptation (e.g., decreased lower limb robusticity following decreased mobility; changes in body proportions along with climatic change), others are more difficult to explain. For instance, craniodental and upper limb robusticity show complex evolutionary patterns that do not always correspond to expectations. In addition, the marked decline in stature and the mosaic nature of change in body proportions still await clarifications. These issues, as well as systematic analysis of specific pathologies and possible relationships between genetic lineages, population movements and cultural complexes, should be among the goals of future research.",,"ice; agriculture; animal; body size; bone; climate; cultural anthropology; diet; feeding behavior; female; fossil; histology; history; hominid; human; Italy; male; paleontology; review; skull; Agriculture; Animals; Body Size; Bone and Bones; Climate; Culture; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Ice; Italy; Male; Paleontology; Skull",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-59849125888

In this paper, the midsagittal vault profile and the 3D frontal bone morphology of Ceprano are investigated comparatively, using landmark coordinates and Procrustes superimposition. In fact, despite the fact that the skull appears partially distorted by diagenetic pressures (thus precluding a comprehensive landmark-based analysis), some aspects of the overall morphology are suitable for consideration in terms of geometric morphometrics. The midsagittal profile shows an archaic shape, comparable with the H. ergaster/erectus range of variation because of the fronto-parietal flattening, the development of the supraorbital and nuchal structures, and the occurrence of a slightly larger occipital bone. By contrast, the frontal bone displays a derived 3D shape that, mostly because of the widening of the frontal squama, appears comparable with the Afro-European variation of the Middle Pleistocene (i.e., H. heidelbergensis/rhodesiensis). Taking into account the unique morphological pattern displayed by Ceprano, its role as a link between early Homo and the Middle Pleistocene populations of Europe and Africa is not falsified. Thus, when aspects of the Ceprano's morphology are described within the analytical framework provided by geometric morphometrics, the relationships between Ceprano and the subsequent Afro-European fossil record are emphasized, suggesting the occurrence of an ancestral stock of H. heidelbergensis/ rhodesiensis that is properly represented by the Italian specimen. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cranial morphology; Europe; Geometric morphometrics; Homo; Human evolution","Africa; article; calvaria; craniofacial morphology; Europe; evolution; fossil; frontal bone; geometry; hominid; homo erectus; Homo ergaster; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo rhodesiensis; human; Italy; Middle Pleistocene; morphometrics; occipital bone; skull; Animals; Cephalometry; Evolution; Fossils; Hominidae; Italy; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33847037058

The skull from Hofmeyr, South Africa, which has been dated to c. 36. ka, is one of the only specimens known from this critical part of the late Pleistocene. The Hofmeyr skull was largely intact at the time of its discovery but has suffered post-recovery mishandling, with the resultant loss of most of the lower facial skeleton, the mandibular angle, the right mastoid process, and much of the occipital. Given the potential significance of this specimen, we have undertaken its restoration and reconstruction so as to provide a more complete picture of the cranial morphology of the late Pleistocene population from which it derived. On the basis of photographs, measurements, and morphological description recorded prior to its having been damaged, we reconstructed some of the missing bone in modeling clay on a high resolution plastic cast of the cranium. The original specimen was CT scanned, as was the cast with the reconstructed maxilla and mastoid; these scans were employed in the final computer reconstruction of the skull. Virtual reconstruction of the remainder of the cranium was accomplished using mirror-imaging and reference-based methods, employing 3D geometric morphometrics from a sample of recent human crania to compute coordinate-based estimates of the missing parts. This reconstruction provides a more complete picture of the Hofmeyr cranium and serves as a basis for more comprehensive morphometric comparisons. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Clay modeling; Cranial capacity; Craniometry; Cranium; CT scan; Geometric morphometrics; Mandible; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline; Virtual reconstruction","hominid; human evolution; morphology; paleontology; Pleistocene; reconstruction; skeletal remains; skull; three-dimensional modeling; Eastern Cape; Hofmeyr; South Africa; Crania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954214835

Phylogenetic relationships among these groupings are also explored using neighbor-joining analysis of the metric data. Results indicate that the terminal Pleistocene/early Holocene fossils from Australasia exhibit a close genetic affinity with early modern humans from the Levant. Furthermore, recent human populations and Upper Paleolithic Europeans share a most recent common ancestor not shared with either the early Australasians or the early Levantine humans. This pattern of genetic and phylogenetic relationships suggests that the early modern humans from the Levant either contributed directly to the ancestry of an early lineage of Australasians, or that they share a recent common ancestor with them. The principal findings of the study, therefore, lend support to the notion of an early dispersal from Africa by a more ancient lineage of modern human prior to 50 ka, perhaps as early as OIS 5 times (76-100 ka). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Fifty-five fossil crania dating from the early to the late Pleistocene were analyzed. Using a modified pantograph, outlines of the frontal bone were collected along the midsagittal and two parasagittal planes. The profile from nasion to bregma, as well as two profiles above the medial and lateral sections of the orbit, respectively, extending from the orbital margin to the coronal suture were traced. The outlines were measured using Elliptical Fourier Function Analysis (EFFA), which enabled a quantification of aspects of the frontal bone that have historically been described primarily in nonmetric or linear terms. Four measurements were obtained: 1) overall morphology as expressed in the Fourier harmonic amplitudes; 2) maximum projection of the supraorbital torus at three points along the browridge (glabella and the medial and lateral aspects of the torus above the orbit); 3) maximum distance of the frontal squama from the frontal chord, capturing forehead curvature; and 4) nasion-bregma chord length. The results indicate that the midsagittal profile is significantly different among all Pleistocene groups in analyses that include both size and shape, as well as size-adjusted data. Homo erectus is significantly different from the late Pleistocene groups (Neandertals and early modern H. sapiens) in glabellar projection. Anatomically modern humans are significantly different from all other groups in both raw and size-standardized analyses of all three outlines that captured overall morphology, as well as forehead curvature and lateral supraorbital torus prominence, and middle Pleistocene Homo are significantly different in both medial and lateral overall parasagittal form. However, for the majority of analyses there were no significant differences among the Pleistocene archaic groups in supraorbital torus projection, frontal squama curvature, nasion-bregma chord length, or overall frontal bone morphology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Its affinity is important to studies of Late Pleistocene hominin growth and development as well as interpretations of the Central Asian Middle Paleolithic and the geographic distribution of Neandertals. A close examination of the original Russian monograph reveals the incompleteness of key morphologies associated with the cranial base and face and problems with the reconstruction of the Teshik-Tash cranium, making its Neandertal attribution less certain than previously assumed. This study reassesses the Neandertal status of Teshik-Tash 1 by comparing it to a sample of Neandertal, Middle and Upper Paleolithic modern humans, and recent human sub-adults. Separate examinations of the cranium and mandible are conducted using multinomial logistic regression and discriminant function analysis to assess group membership. Results of the cranial analysis group Teshik-Tash with Upper Paleolithic modern humans when variables are not size-standardized, while results of the mandibular analysis place the specimen with recent modern humans for both raw and size-standardized data. Although these results are influenced by limitations related to the incomplete nature of the comparative sample, they suggest that the morphology of Teshik-Tash 1 as expressed in craniometrics is equivocal. Although, further quantitative studies as well as additional sub-adult fossil finds from this region are needed to ascertain the morphological pattern of this specimen specifically, and Central Asian Middle Paleolithic hominins in general, these results challenge current characterizations of this territory as the eastern boundary of the Neandertal range during the Late Pleistocene. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Dispersals; Late pleistocene; Logistic regression; Sub-adult hominin fossil","Animals; Asia, Central; Child; Child, Preschool; Hominidae; Humans; Mandible; Paleontology; Regression Analysis; Sample Size; Skull; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149524816

However, by about 20,000 BP this area was settled by modern humans who had highly sophisticated and sometimes unique technologies. Not many Upper Paleolithic human fossils have been described from this area and consequently the morphology of these people remains largely unknown. Here, we present descriptions and a comparative morphological analysis of four possibly late Pleistocene fossils from European Russia: Skhodnya, Khvalynsk, Satanay, and Podkumok. The frontal bone is chosen for study because it is preserved in all of these fossils and is known to provide good discrimination among groups of Pleistocene hominins. All four fossils have been previously claimed to possess 'archaic' features of frontal morphology, such as developed supraorbital relief and a flat frontal squama. The results of a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of frontal bone landmarks and semilandmarks indicate that these fossils indisputably belong to modern humans. However, there are good reasons to associate Khvalynsk, Skhodnya, and Podkumok with Upper Paleolithic fossils from central and western Europe, whereas Satanay is more similar to a pooled sample of recent modern humans. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Frontal bone; Geometric morphometrics; Russian calvariae","bone; dispersal; fossil; hominid; morphology; morphometry; Paleolithic; Russian Federation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650863246

The fossil material consists of more than 100 specimens from the large Main Cave (e.g., Mladeč 1 and 2) and from the Quarry Cave (e.g., Mladeč 5 and 6). Both sites seem to be accumulations of human remains that fell through chimneys or fissures into the karstic cave system (Frayer, 1986; Svoboda, 2000). The morphological differences of Mladeč 5 and 6 vs. 1 and 2 (interestingly each group originating from a different cave) are attributed to sexual dimorphism by most authors (Jelínek, 1983; Frayer, 1986; Wolpoff et al., this volume). In spite of substantial morphological variation within sex (Frayer, 1986), the specimens considered to be male (Mladeč 5 and 6) are very robust, with a low braincase, thick cranial bones, Neandertal-like occipital bunning, marked spongy bone development, thick projecting supraorbitals shaped differently than in Neandertals, and large cranial capacities, whereas the female specimens (Mladeč 1 and 2) are more gracile than the Mladeč males but robust nevertheless in comparison with recent Homo sapiens. Since 1900 (Anthropology-Congress Halle a. S., IX/1900), the Mladeč remains have been generally considered to be modern Homo sapiens (""Cro-Magnon race""; Szombathy, 1925) or, according to the discoverer, as ""definitely belonging to the Homo sapiens fossilis"" (ibid.). Most anthropologists today accept Mladeč as modern Homo sapiens, but the prominent supraorbitals, the welldeveloped occipital bun reminiscent of the Neandertal ""chignon"", and the distinct nuchal ridge have stimulated speculations about possible anatomical links to the Neandertals who preceded them. The relation of this assemblage (one of the earliest in Central Europe) to other groups of fossil hominids is crucial and likewise the question of hybridisation (Bräuer, 1980; Duarte et al., 1999; Tattersall and Schwartz, 1999) because of the chronological and regional overlapping of anatomically modern humans and Neandertals in Europe. That relation has therefore been the focus of diverse studies, including comparisons of gross morphology (Jelínek, 1951; Smith, 1982; Frayer, 1986; Bräuer and Broeg, 1998, Wolpoff et al., 2001; Frayer et al., this volume; Wolpoff et al., this volume) and of mtDNA (Serre et al., 2004) and new radiometric datings of hominid and faunal remains (Wild et al., 2005). Especially Mladeč 5 (see Fig. 1.) was described as Neandertal-like in several aspects by Smith (1982), Jelínek (1983), and Wolpoff (1999), and also as resembling Jebel Irhoud-like or archaic Homo (Stringer et al., 1984). Frayer (1986) saw Mladeč as ""good evidence in support of the gradualist model,"" with ""a greater number of archaic features shared with Neandertals"" (see also Frayer et al., this volume). Others have reached quite opposite conclusions: for instance, Bräuer and Broeg (1998) via a non-metric analysis. Klein (2003), too, noted that the typical cranial traits of Neandertals preclude a major Neandertal contribution to living human populations. © 2006 Springer-Verlag/Wien.
