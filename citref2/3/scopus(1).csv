Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Γ yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets ≥4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25 057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51 089 bp) taxa, respectively. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,"article; calculation; controlled study; data analysis software; genetic algorithm; information processing; intermethod comparison; maximum likelihood method; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; priority journal; process model; process optimization; sequence alignment; taxon; Algorithms; Conserved Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Software; Species Specificity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750403801

Moreover, because of the next-generation sequencing revolution, datasets used for conducting phylogenetic analyses grow at an unprecedented pace. RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a popular program for phylogenetic analyses of large datasets under maximum likelihood. Since the last RAxML paper in 2006, it has been continuously maintained and extended to accommodate the increasingly growing input datasets and to serve the needs of the user community. Results: I present some of the most notable new features and extensions of RAxML, such as a substantial extension of substitution models and supported data types, the introduction of SSE3, AVX and AVX2 vector intrinsics, techniques for reducing the memory requirements of the code and a plethora of operations for conducting postanalyses on sets of trees. In addition, an up-to-date 50-page user manual covering all new RAxML options is available. © The Author 2013.

These methods show differences in shape among specimens as residuals after rotation, translation, and scaling them so that they align as well as possible. A new method is presented that generalizes Siegel and Benson's (1982) resistant-fit theta-rho analysis so that more than two objects can be compared at the same time. Both least-squares and resistant-fit approaches are generalized to allow for affine transformations (uniform shape change). The methods are compared, using artificial data and data on 18 landmarks on the wings of 127 species of North American mosquitoes. Graphical techniques are also presented to help summarize the patterns of differences in shape among the objects being compared. © 1990 Society of Systematic Zoology.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860428591

This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format. © 2014 Bouckaert et al.",,"article; Bayes theorem; computer interface; controlled study; data analysis software; mathematical computing; phylogenetic tree; phylogeography; population size; simulation; stochastic model; system analysis; computer language; computer program; evolution; Bayes Theorem; Biological Evolution; Programming Languages; Software",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901305512

The dog is of particular interest because it provides important evolutionary information and because existing breeds show great phenotypic diversity for morphological, physiological and behavioural traits. We use sequence comparison with the primate and rodent lineages to shed light on the structure and evolution of genomes and genes. Notably, the majority of the most highly conserved non-coding sequences in mammalian genomes are clustered near a small subset of genes with important roles in development. Analysis of SNPs reveals long-range haplotypes across the entire dog genome, and defines the nature of genetic diversity within and across breeds. The current SNP map now makes it possible for genome-wide association studies to identify genes responsible for diseases and traits, with important consequences for human and companion animal health. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Disease control; Genes; Health care; Non-coding sequences; Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP); Biodiversity; biology; article; breeding; comparative study; development; dog; gene cluster; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene mapping; gene sequence; gene structure; genetic line; genetic variability; haplotype; human; mammal; molecular evolution; morphology; nonhuman; phenotype; primate; priority journal; rodent; single nucleotide polymorphism; Animalia; Canis familiaris; Canis lupus; Mammalia; Primates; Rodentia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-28644447707

Obtained from 4,000-year-old permafrost-preserved hair, the genome represents a male individual from the first known culture to settle in Greenland. Sequenced to an average depth of 20Ã-, we recover 79% of the diploid genome, an amount close to the practical limit of current sequencing technologies. We identify 353,151 high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 6.8% have not been reported previously. We estimate raw read contamination to be no higher than 0.8%. We use functional SNP assessment to assign possible phenotypic characteristics of the individual that belonged to a culture whose location has yielded only trace human remains. We compare the high-confidence SNPs to those of contemporary populations to find the populations most closely related to the individual. This provides evidence for a migration from Siberia into the New World some 5,500 years ago, independent of that giving rise to the modern Native Americans and Inuit. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We find that a loss of short molecules can occur during DNA extraction and present an improved silica-based extraction protocol that enables their efficient retrieval. In combination with single-stranded DNA library preparation, this method enabled us to reconstruct the mitochondrial genome sequence from a Middle Pleistocene cave bear (Ursus deningeri) bone excavated at Sima de los Huesos in the Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain. Phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the U. deningeri sequence forms an early diverging sister lineage to all Western European Late Pleistocene cave bears. Our results prove that authentic ancient DNA can be preserved for hundreds of thousand years outside of permafrost. Moreover, the techniques presented enable the retrieval of phylogenetically informative sequences from samples in which virtually all DNA is diminished to fragments shorter than 50 bp.",,"DNA fragment; article; bear; DNA extraction; DNA library; DNA sequence; gene sequence; Middle Pleistocene; mitochondrial genome; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; permafrost; phylogeny; Pleistocene; priority journal; Upper Pleistocene; Animals; Base Sequence; Caves; DNA; Genome, Mitochondrial; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Time Factors; Ursidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884624229

However, the techniques used contain inherent problems, particularly with regards to the generation of authentic and useful data. The solution currently advocated to reduce contamination and artefactual results is to adopt criteria for authentication. Nevertheless, these criteria are not foolproof, and we believe that they have, in practice, replaced the use of thought and prudence when designing and executing ancient DNA studies. We argue here that researchers in this field must take a more cognitive and self-critical approach. Specifically, in place of checking criteria off lists, researchers must explain, in sufficient enough detail to dispel doubt, how the data were obtained, and why they should be believed to be authentic. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have failed to establish the time and precise place of origin because of lack of phylogenetic resolution in the so far studied control region (CR), and inadequate sampling. We therefore analyzed entire mitochondrial genomes for 169 dogs to obtain maximal phylogenetic resolution and the CR for 1,543 dogs across the Old World for a comprehensive picture of geographical diversity. Hereby, a detailed picture of the origins of the dog can for the first time be suggested. We obtained evidence that the dog has a single origin in time and space and an estimation of the time of origin, number of founders, and approximate region, which also gives potential clues about the human culture involved. The analyses showed that dogs universally share a common homogenous gene pool containing 10 major haplogroups. However, the full range of genetic diversity, all 10 haplogroups, was found only in southeastern Asia south of Yangtze River, and diversity decreased following a gradient across Eurasia, through seven haplogroups in Central China and five in North China and Southwest (SW)Asia, down to only four haplogroups in Europe. The mean sequence distance to ancestral haplotypes indicates an origin 5,400-16,300 years ago (ya) from at least 51 female wolf founders. These results indicate that the domestic dog originated in southern China less than 16,300 ya, from several hundred wolves. The place and time coincide approximately with the origin of rice agriculture, suggesting that the dogs may have originated among sedentary hunter-gatherers or early farmers, and the numerous founders indicate that wolf taming was an important culture trait.","Canis familiaris; Dog; Domestication; Mitochondrial DNA","mitochondrial DNA; Africa; article; China; controlled study; DNA sequence; dog; Europe; evolution; female; genetic variability; haplotype; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; phylogeography; Southeast Asia; wolf; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; China; DNA, Mitochondrial; Dogs; Europe; Female; Gene Pool; Genome, Mitochondrial; Geography; Haplotypes; Locus Control Region; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Rivers; Time Factors; Wolves; Canidae; Canis familiaris",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450227389

Using ancient and modern genome-wide data, we found that the ancestors of all present-day Native Americans, including Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago (ka) and after no more than an 8000-year isolation period in Beringia. After their arrival to the Americas, ancestral Native Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches around 13 ka, one that is now dispersed across North and South America and the other restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow resulted in some Native Americans sharing ancestry with present-day East Asians (including Siberians) and, more distantly, Australo-Melanesians. Putative ""Paleoamerican"" relict populations, including the historical Mexican Pericúes and South American Fuego-Patagonians, are not directly related to modern Australo-Melanesians as suggested by the Paleoamerican Model. © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

However, despite decades of study, its timing remains controversial, with recent reappraisals suggesting that it may have occurred much later than the date of A.D. 1000 most often assumed for it. In this paper, we present newly obtained radiocarbon dates from two early Thule sites, Nelson River (OhRh-1) and Washout (NjVi-2), located on the Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf coasts. This region is crucial to any understanding of the migration, because Thule Inuit would have had to pass through it in order to reach the eastern Arctic. Nelson River in particular has long been considered a good candidate for the earliest Thule site east of Alaska, based on a number of lines of evidence including the presence of both Natchuk and Sicco harpoon heads. In this paper, we present new dates for Nelson River and Washout that demonstrate that neither site was occupied before the thirteenth century A.D. The new dates have profound implications for Arctic archaeology, because they strengthen the case for a thirteenth-century migration, and by doing so demonstrate that it was more rapid and widespread than has generally been believed. The dates also suggest that the ""Classic"" Thule period is a relatively brief phenomenon, lasting perhaps only 200 years or less, before being rapidly reorganized into the diversity of Inuit societies encountered in later Arctic history.

However, from the perspective of conservation, hybridization poses a concern, as it can threaten the integrity and fitness of many wild species, including canids. As a result of habitat fragmentation and extensive hunting pressure, gray wolf (Canis lupus) populations have declined dramatically in Europe and elsewhere during recent centuries. Small and fragmented populations have persisted, but often only in the presence of large numbers of dogs, which increase the potential for hybridization and introgression to deleteriously affect wolf populations. Here, we demonstrate hybridization between wolf and dog populations in Estonia and Latvia, and the role of both genders in the hybridization process, using combined analysis of maternal, paternal and biparental genetic markers. Eight animals exhibiting unusual external characteristics for wolves - six from Estonia and two from Latvia - proved to be wolf-dog hybrids. However, one of the hybridization events was extraordinary. Previous field observations and genetic studies have indicated that mating between wolves and dogs is sexually asymmetrical, occurring predominantly between female wolves and male dogs. While this was also the case among the Estonian hybrids, our data revealed the existence of dog mitochondrial genomes in the Latvian hybrids and, together with Y chromosome and autosomal microsatellite data, thus provided the first evidence from Europe of mating between male wolves and female dogs. We discuss patterns of sexual asymmetry in wolf-dog hybridization. © 2012 Hindrikson et al.",,"mitochondrial DNA; animal tissue; article; autosome; controlled study; dog; Estonia; female; gene locus; genetic analysis; genetic marker; genetic variability; hybridization; Latvia; male; mating; mitochondrial genome; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; population abundance; population size; wolf; Y chromosome; Animals; DNA, Satellite; Dogs; Female; Genetic Variation; Hybridization, Genetic; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Wolves; Animalia; Canidae; Canis familiaris; Canis lupus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867034288

Consequently, humans have taken dogs to nearly every corner of the globe. Recent translocations of Western dogs stemming from the Victorian era dog fancy have erased some of the ancient genetic signatures of these earlier migrations. Here we used DNA of ancient and modern dogs from the North American Arctic of Alaska and Greenland to assess their genetic continuity in time and space. We successfully sequenced 23 archaeological (ca. AD 1250-1910) and recent (ca. AD 1930-1990) surfacecollected Canis bone and tooth samples and compared them to 51 modern Inuit Sled Dogs and to published sequences of modern Alaskan Malamutes (and additional Inuit Sled Dogs) to test for evidence of lineage replacement or genetic continuity through time. Ancient samples from Alaska and Greenland and modern sequences from Greenland all contained a high frequency of haplotype A31, which was previously described only in modern North American Arctic dogs. Thus, A31 was a common thread tyingt he entire North American Arctic together prior to European colonization and, in the Eastern Arctic, indicates genetic continuity between past and present dogs as well. However, A31 is rare in modern Alaskan dogs, consistent with post-colonization replacement by Eurasian matrilines. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ancient DNA; Arctic; Genetic continuity; Inuit Sled Dog; Thule culture","canid; colonization; DNA; genetics; translocation; Alaska; Arctic; Greenland; United States; Canis; Canis familiaris",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873839807

BP). In 2003, however, Goebel et al. reported that layer 7 more likely formed only 13,000. cal. BP, nearly 4000 years later than N.N. Dikov, the site's primary excavator, originally reported. Some researchers have downplayed the significance of the new dates, continuing to regard Dikov's early dates as evidence that at least some of the hearth and dwelling features previously excavated at Ushki-1 date to as early as 17,000. cal. BP. Here we present four new radiocarbon dates (and two previously unpublished dates) on curated charcoal from hearth features excavated at Ushki-1 more than 20 years ago. They indicate that these hearths and associated dwelling features date to about 13,000. cal. BP. We now know 15 radiocarbon dates on charcoal from a variety of features and profiles across Ushki-1 and Ushki-5 that indicate the age of layer 7 is about 13,000. cal. BP. We discount the four 16,000-17,000. cal. BP dates, first, because two of them came from a deeply dug human burial pit and were likely secondarily introduced into the burial; second, because provenience data for the other two dated samples were never reported and do not exist in the records of the radiocarbon laboratories that produced them; and, third, because sediments immediately underlying layer 7 at Ushki-1 are only a few centuries earlier than 13,000. cal. BP, providing an important lower-limiting age for the layer-7 occupation. We conclude that the age of all of the layer-7 features at Ushki-1 and Ushki-5 should be considered to be about 13,000. cal.

Whether models obtained through photogrammetry can be used for zooarchaeological studies requires a systematic examination. In the context of research into dog domestication, we explore whether 3D models of wolf crania, obtained through a photogrammetric approach, accurately describe the original cranium in term of colouration, texture and most importantly, geometry.To answer this question, we compared the topology of 3D models obtained with a high-resolution surface scanner (used as reference geometry) with models reconstructed from the same five wolf crania using photogrammetry. The pairs of models were then compared using both a visual, qualitative and two quantitative approaches. The latter, a geometric comparison computed the deviation map between the pairs of 3D models, which was then followed by a 3D landmark based geometric morphometric approach using corresponding analyses.Our results demonstrate that photogrammetry can produce 3D models with visually satisfying levels of morphological detail in terms of texture, colouration and geometry. In addition, the quantitative comparison of the models revealed an average distance between the two surfaces of 0.088 mm with an average standard deviation of 0.53 mm. The geometric morphometric analyses revealed the same degree of measurement error for the two series of scans (2.04% and 1.95%), with only 6.31% of the morphometric variation being due to the acquisition technique. Photogrammetry, therefore, offers a low cost, easily portable and simple to perform alternative to traditional surface scanning, affording advantages that make it a highly useful tool for zooarchaeological research. © 2016 The Authors.","3D models; Canis lupus; Geometric morphometrics; Photogrammetry; Skull; Surface scanning; Wolf",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978225025

Genomic analysis of the oldest human remains from the Americas showed a direct relationship between a Clovis-related ancestral population and all modern Central and South Americans as well as a deep split separating them from North Americans in Canada. We present 91 ancient human genomes from California and Southwestern Ontario and demonstrate the existence of two distinct ancestries in North America, which possibly split south of the ice sheets. A contribution from both of these ancestral populations is found in all modern Central and South Americans. The proportions of these two ancestries in ancient and modern populations are consistent with a coastal dispersal and multiple admixture events. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

To clarify the morphological characteristics of the Zhokhov dogs' skulls, they were compared to the modern skulls of the Eastern Siberian wolves. This analysis shows, that around 9000 years ago a fully formed, as a species, domesticated dog was present at the Zhokhov site and used by the inhabitants of the area while hunting and as a draft animal. Presence of a developed form of dog sledding has been securely established for this culture. The Zhokhov site osteological dog remains analysis showed that the comparison of two proportional ratios (the ratio of skull height in the cranial region to total skull length and the ratio of snout height at Рm1 – Рm2 to total skull length) is a universal and reliable criterion for distinguishing wolf skulls from wolf-like dog skulls. This method prevents the influence of any single measurement on the identification of any individual as a dog or a wolf. We propose to name them indices DD1 and DD2, accordingly (for Dog Domestication). We also show that a sled dog and hunting dog standard existed, which significantly changes the current ideas about the timing of specialized dog breed formation via directed selection. Full completion of this process marks the third stage of domestication. Two earlier stages precede it in time and space (natural selection via the feeding behavior within specific ecological niche, formed by the human activity, followed by artificial selection based on the animal's ability to be tamed). We suggest that sled dogs could have been used in Siberia around 15,000 years ago. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dog evolution; Dog fossils; Dog morphology; Early Holocene; Siberian Arctic",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018300983

We sequenced 71 mitochondrial and 7 nuclear genomes from ancient North American and Siberian dogs from time frames spanning ~9000 years. Our analysis indicates that American dogs were not derived from North American wolves. Instead, American dogs form a monophyletic lineage that likely originated in Siberia and dispersed into the Americas alongside people. After the arrival of Europeans, native American dogs almost completely disappeared, leaving a minimal genetic legacy in modern dog populations. The closest detectable extant lineage to precontact American dogs is the canine transmissible venereal tumor, a contagious cancer clone derived from an individual dog that lived up to 8000 years ago. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The close relationship between dogs and humans has also been used by archaeologists to draw inferences about human society (particularly in terms of diet and subsistence) from various analyses of their remains. Here, we apply the complementary approaches of stable isotope and zooarchaeological analysis to dog remains from the permafrost-preserved, pre-contact Yup'ik village site of Nunalleq (c. CE 1300–1750), in coastal western Alaska, specifically to investigate dog-human dietary relationships and the role that dogs played in this community. Zooarchaeological data indicate an abundance of dogs at the site, with butchery marks suggesting that they were processed for meat. Stable isotope analysis of multiple tissues indicates dog diet was largely based on fish (particularly salmonids), with possible short-term increases in marine mammal consumption. Comparison with data from contemporaneous human hair from Nunalleq indicates a close similarity between human and dog diets, supporting the use of dogs as a proxy for human palaeodiet in societies at high-latitude societies consuming significant amounts of animal protein. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Alaska; Carbon; Dog; Nitrogen; Palaeodiet; Prehistory; Yup'ik",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964596859

We document complex population dynamics during this period, including at least three major migration events: an initial peopling by a previously unknown Palaeolithic population of ‘Ancient North Siberians’ who are distantly related to early West Eurasian hunter-gatherers; the arrival of East Asian-related peoples, which gave rise to ‘Ancient Palaeo-Siberians’ who are closely related to contemporary communities from far-northeastern Siberia (such as the Koryaks), as well as Native Americans; and a Holocene migration of other East Asian-related peoples, who we name ‘Neo-Siberians’, and from whom many contemporary Siberians are descended. Each of these population expansions largely replaced the earlier inhabitants, and ultimately generated the mosaic genetic make-up of contemporary peoples who inhabit a vast area across northern Eurasia and the Americas. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"genetic analysis; genome; Holocene; hunter-gatherer; indigenous population; internal migration; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; population dynamics; American Indian; article; genome; Holocene; human; hunter-gatherer; Koryak (people); Paleolithic; population dynamics; Russian Federation; Upper Pleistocene; Western Hemisphere; Asia; ethnology; Europe; gene pool; genetics; haplotype; history; human genome; male; migration; Russian Federation; ancient DNA; Asia; DNA, Ancient; Europe; Gene Pool; Genome, Human; Haplotypes; History, 15th Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Human Migration; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Siberia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066934053

However, the North American Arctic harbors dogs that are potentially descended from pre-historical ancestors, as well as those affected by post-colonial translocations and admixtures. In particular, Inuit dogs from Canada and Greenland are thought to descend from dogs associated with Thule peoples, who relied on them for transportation ca. 1000 years ago. Whether Thule dogs reflected an earlier colonization by Paleoeskimo dogs ca. 4500 years ago is unknown. During the Alaskan Gold Rush, additional sled dogs, possibly of post-colonial derivation, the Alaskan Husky, Malamute and Siberian Husky, were used in the Arctic. The genealogical relationships among and origins of these breeds are unknown. Here we use autosomal, paternal and maternal DNA markers to (1) test the hypothesis that Inuit dogs have retained their indigenous ancestry, (2) characterize their relationship to one another and to other Arctic breeds, and (3) estimate the age of North American indigenous matrilines and patrilines. On the basis of the agreement of all three markers we determined that Inuit dogs have maintained their indigenous nature, and that they likely derive from Thule dogs. In addition, we provide support for previous research that the Inuit dogs from Canada and Greenland dog should not be distinguished as two breeds. The Alaskan Husky displayed evidence of European introgression, in contrast to the Malamute and Siberian Husky, which appear to have maintained most of their ancient Siberian ancestry. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"ancestry; canid; colonization; DNA; genetic marker; genetic variation; hypothesis testing; Arctic; Canada; Greenland; North America; Siberia; Canis familiaris; genetic marker; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; Arctic; breeding; DNA sequence; dog; female; genetic marker; genetic variation; genetics; haplotype; male; molecular evolution; population genetics; Y chromosome; Animals; Arctic Regions; Breeding; DNA, Mitochondrial; Dogs; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Y Chromosome",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947045788

In order to examine the history of the Canid species in the Siberian Arctic, we carried out genetic analysis of fourteen canid remains from various sites, including the well-documented Upper Paleolithic Yana RHS and Early Holocene Zhokhov Island sites. Estimated age of samples range from as recent as 1,700 years before present (YBP) to at least 360,000 YBP for the remains of the extinct wolf, Canis cf. variabilis. In order to examine the genetic affinities of ancient Siberian canids species to the domestic dog and modern wolves, we obtained mitochondrial DNA control region sequences and compared them to published ancient and modern canid sequences. The older canid specimens illustrate affinities with pre-domestic dog/wolf lineages while others appear in the major phylogenetic clades of domestic dogs. Our results suggest a European origin of domestic dog may not be conclusive and illustrates an emerging complexity of genetic contribution of regional wolf breeds to the modern Canis gene pool. © 2015 Lee et al.

They were subsequently joined and largely displaced around 1,000 years ago by ancestors of the present-day Inuit and Yup’ik1–3. The genetic relationship between Palaeo-Eskimos and Native American, Inuit, Yup’ik and Aleut populations remains uncertain4–6. Here we present genomic data for 48 ancient individuals from Chukotka, East Siberia, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the Canadian Arctic. We co-analyse these data with data from present-day Alaskan Iñupiat and West Siberian populations and published genomes. Using methods based on rare-allele and haplotype sharing, as well as established techniques4,7–9, we show that Palaeo-Eskimo-related ancestry is ubiquitous among people who speak Na-Dene and Eskimo–Aleut languages. We develop a comprehensive model for the Holocene peopling events of Chukotka and North America, and show that Na-Dene-speaking peoples, people of the Aleutian Islands, and Yup’ik and Inuit across the Arctic region all share ancestry from a single Palaeo-Eskimo-related Siberian source. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Alaska; allele; ancestry group; Arctic; Canada; Chukotka; data analysis; ethnic group; genetic analysis; haplotype; Holocene; human; Inupiat (people); language ability; Letter; North America; Palaeo-Eskimo; Paleosiberian people; principal component analysis; priority journal; Russian Federation; Yupik (people); cladistics; Palaeo Eskimo (people); population genetics; population research; single nucleotide polymorphism; Africa; classification; ethnology; Europe; genetics; history; human genome; Inuit; migration; phylogeny; phylogeography; Southeast Asia; Africa; Alaska; Alleles; Arctic Regions; Asia, Southeastern; Canada; Europe; Genome, Human; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Inuits; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Principal Component Analysis; Siberia",Letter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067075462

Nunalleq is deeply stratified, presenting a robust relative chronological framework of well-defined individual house floors abundant in ecofacts suitable for radiocarbon dating. Capitalizing on this potential, we present the results of one of the first applications of Bayesian statistical modeling of radiocarbon data from an archaeological site in the North American Arctic. Using these methods, we demonstrate that it is possible to generate robust, high-resolution chronological models from Arctic archaeology. Radiocarbon dates, procured prior to the program of dating and modeling presented here, suggested an approximately three-century duration of occupation at the site. The results of Bayesian modeling nuance this interpretation. While it is possible that there may have been activity for almost three centuries (beginning in the late fourteenth century), occupation of the dwelling complex, which dominates the site, was more likely to have endured for no more than a century.

Both landmasses were covered by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 years before present [YBP]); after the glacier retreated, ice patches remained on the island until ca. 9,000 calibrated (cal) YBP [1]. Nevertheless, indigenous peoples, whose ancestors had trekked some 5,000 km from the west coast, arrived approximately 10,000 cal YBP in Labrador and ca. 6,000 cal YBP in Newfoundland [2, 3]. Differential features in material culture indicate at least three settlement episodes by distinct cultural groups, including the Maritime Archaic, Palaeoeskimo, and Beothuk. Newfoundland has remained home to indigenous peoples until present day with only one apparent hiatus (3,400–2,800 YBP). This record suggests abandonment, severe constriction, or local extinction followed by subsequent immigrations from single or multiple source populations, but the specific dynamics and the cultural and biological relationships, if any, among these successive peoples remain enigmatic [4]. By examining the mitochondrial genome diversity and isotopic ratios of 74 ancient remains in conjunction with the archaeological record, we have provided definitive evidence for the genetic discontinuity between the maternal lineages of these populations. This northeastern margin of North America appears to have been populated multiple times by distinct groups that did not share a recent common ancestry, but rather one much deeper in time at the entry point into the continent. Duggan et al. generate 74 whole mitochondrial genomes and stable-isotope data from three ancient aboriginal populations from coastal Eastern Canada, spanning eight millennia as well as European contact. The findings indicate a lack of genetic continuity between successive cultural groups and suggest complex dynamics of population and settlement. © 2017","ancient DNA; Beothuk; Maritime Archaic; mitochondrial genomes; population genetics; stable isotopes","ancient DNA; adolescent; adult; aged; American Indian; archeology; child; female; genetic variation; human; human genome; infant; male; middle aged; migration; mitochondrial genome; newborn; Newfoundland and Labrador; preschool child; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Archaeology; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA, Ancient; Female; Genetic Variation; Genome, Human; Genome, Mitochondrial; Human Migration; Humans; Indians, North American; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Newfoundland and Labrador; Young Adult",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031307133

Although the Paleo-Inuit were present for millennia, archaeological and genetic studies suggest that modern peoples descend from a second, more recent tradition known as the Neo-Inuit. Origins of the Neo-Inuit and their relations to the earlier and later Indigenous peoples are an area of active study. Here, we genetically analyze the maternal lineages present at Nuvuk, once the northernmost community in Alaska and located in a region identified as a possible origin point of the Neo-Inuit Thule. The cemetery at Nuvuk contains human remains representing a nearly one thousand year uninterrupted occupation from early Thule to post-contact Iñupiat. Materials and methods: We selected 44 individuals from Nuvuk with calibrated dates between 981 AD and 1885 AD for molecular analysis. We amplified and sequenced the hypervariable segment I of the mitogenome. We compared the Nuvuk data with previously published sequences from 68 modern and ancient communities from across Asia and North America. Phylogeographic analyses suggest possible scenarios of Holocene Arctic and sub-Arctic population movements. Results: We successfully retrieved sequence data from 39 individuals. Haplogroup frequencies in Nuvuk were typed as 66.7% A2b1, 25.6% A2a, and 7.7% D4b1a2a1a. These results suggest that the population at Nuvuk was closest to the ancient Thule and modern Inuit of Canada, and to the Siberian Naukan people. We confirm that haplogroups A2a, A2b1, D2a, and D4b1a2a1a appear at high frequency in Arctic and sub-Arctic populations of North America and Chukotka. Sister clades D2b and D4b1a2a1b are present in Asian and Eastern European populations. Discussion: The ancient mitochondrial sequences from Nuvuk confirm the link between the North Slope and the Thule who later spread east, and the maternal discontinuity between the Neo-Inuit and Paleo-Inuit. We suggest haplogroups A2a, A2b, and D4b1a2a1a are linked to the ancestors of the Thule in eastern Beringia, whereas the D2 and D4b1a2a1 clades appear to have Asian Holocene origins. Further Siberian and Alaskan genomes are necessary to clarify these population migrations beyond a simple two-wave scenario of Neo-Inuit and Paleo-Inuit. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ancient DNA; Arctic; mtDNA; Neo-Inuit; Thule","DNA; ancient DNA; mitochondrial DNA; Alaska; Arctic; Article; Asia; Canada; cemetery; community; DNA extraction; gene amplification; gene sequence; genetic analysis; haplogroup; Holocene; human; human tissue; North America; phylogeography; genetics; haplotype; history; Inuit; physical anthropology; Alaska; Anthropology, Physical; Arctic Regions; DNA, Ancient; DNA, Mitochondrial; Haplotypes; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, Medieval; Humans; Inuits; Phylogeography",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059746323

I focus on their disparate hunting technologies in order to achieve a nuanced understanding on how cultural factors influenced this relationship and to ultimately better understand why Late Dorset disappeared from the archeological record. I assess how hunting technologies impacted each society’s archaeofaunas and describe what appear to be culturally distinct trends in the faunal remains. In light of these findings, differences between Late Dorset and Thule Inuit hunting strategies, and other societal aspects including labor organization, hierarchy, and food provisioning are considered. This research discusses how generalized versus specialized hunting technologies impacted the social trajectory of each society, and methodologically, it provides a case study for how the use of specialized technologies can be viewed in the archeological record. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Arctic archaeology; Human–animal interaction; Hunter-gatherers; Hunting technologies; Zooarchaeology",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041924104
