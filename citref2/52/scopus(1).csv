These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

Distinctions include the orientation of the fetus as it passes through the birth canal, the way the fetus emerges from the birth canal, difficulty during labor, and behavior by the mother and/or other individuals around the time of birth. Birth has important implications for the morphology of the pelvis, for sex differences in the pelvis, for such aspects of human biology as size (and maturity) at birth, and for behavior (including cooperative behavior). This paper reviews the fossil and comparative evidence for when and how the modern pattern of birth evolved. The modern human pattern of birth evolved in a mosaic manner with some unique features appearing early in human evolution and others quite late. A human‐like entry of the fetal head into the birth canal was already present among australopithecines as a result of their wide pelvic apertures. Other aspects of modern human birth such as the rotation of the head and body within the birth canal and the emergence of the fetal head in an occiput anterior position probably evolved later, when encephalization had placed increasing selection on both the form of the pelvis and the timing of birth. Cooperative behavior during and after birth accompanied the origin of the fully modern human mechanism of birth. The unique phenomenon of modern human birth did not evolve in response to a single “obstetrical dilemma” but as part of a complex interplay between changes in a number of aspects of human biology. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

A hypothetical ranking of the accuracy of traits was drawn from the literature. Next, individual traits were evaluated for precision and accuracy of observations, and combinations of two and three traits were evaluated for their collective effectiveness as sex indicators. The effect of age on the accuracy of traits for sex determination was also examined. Precision of traits was generally good. Several combinations of three criteria produced higher levels of accuracy than the trait list as a whole. A total of six traits was judged to be most effective as sex discriminators because of low intraobserver error levels and better than 83% accuracy rates.

However, cephalo-pelvic disproportion is not exclusive to humans, and is present in some primate species of smaller body size. The fossil record indicates mosaic evolution of the obstetric dilemma, involving a number of different evolutionary processes, and it appears to have shifted in magnitude between Australopithecus, Pleistocene Homo, and recent human populations. Most attention to date has focused on its generic nature, rather than on its variability between populations. We reevaluate the nature of the human obstetric dilemma using updated hominin and primate literature, and then consider the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to variability in its magnitude. Both maternal pelvic dimensions and fetal growth patterns are sensitive to ecological factors such as diet and the thermal environment. Neonatal head girth has low plasticity, whereas neonatal mass and maternal stature have higher plasticity. Secular trends in body size may therefore exacerbate or decrease the obstetric dilemma. The emergence of agriculture may have exacerbated the dilemma, by decreasing maternal stature and increasing neonatal growth and adiposity due to dietary shifts. Paleodemographic comparisons between foragers and agriculturalists suggest that foragers have considerably lower rates of perinatal mortality. In contemporary populations, maternal stature remains strongly associated with perinatal mortality in many populations. Long-term improvements in nutrition across future generations may relieve the dilemma, but in the meantime, variability in its magnitude is likely to persist. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Birth; Cephalopelvic disproportion; Encephalization; Growth; Nutrition; Obstetric dilemma; Pelvis; Phenotypic plasticity","animal; article; body size; brain; cephalopelvic disproportion; evolution; female; histology; human; pelvis; physical anthropology; physiology; pregnancy; primate; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Biological Evolution; Body Size; Brain; Cephalopelvic Disproportion; Female; Humans; Pelvis; Pregnancy; Primates; Australopithecus; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872273232

Two reliable visual methods are suggested to assess sex from the hip bone. However, the authors recommend the use of a method based on discriminant function analysis including a probabilistic approach that the authors recently developed with a large sample of known-sex individuals. The population specificity of sexual dimorphism of the other parts of the skeleton is also discussed.

However, researchers disagree in the identification and obstetric significance of pelvic dimorphisms. This study addresses three issues. First, common patterns in dimorphism are identified by analysis of pelvimetrics from six independent samples (Whites and Blacks of known sex and four Amerindian samples of unknown sex). Second, an hypothesis is tested that the index of pelvic dimorphism (female mean × 100/male mean) is inversely related to pelvic variability. Third, the pelvic dimensions of the Neandertal male from Kebara cave, Israel are compared with those of the males in this study. The results show that the pelvic inlet is the plane of least dimorphism in humans. The reason that reports often differ in the identification of dimorphisms for this pelvic plane is that both the length of the pubis and the shape of the inlet are related to nutrition. The dimensions of the pelvis that are most dimorphic (that is, female larger than male) are the measures of posterior space, angulation of sacrum, biischial breadth, and subpubic angle. Interestingly, these dimensions are also the most variable. The hypothesis that variability and dimorphism are inversely related fails to be supported. The factors that influence pelvic variability are discussed. The Kebara 2 pelvis has a spacious inlet and a confined outlet relative to modern males, though the circumferences of both planes in the Neandertal are within the range of variation of modern males. The inference is that outlet circumference in Neandertal females is also small in size, but within the range of variation of modern females.

Its frequent preservation in the fossil record gives the temporal bone added significance in the study of human evolution, but its morphology has proven difficult to quantify. In this study we use techniques of 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify differences among humans and great apes and discuss the results in a phylogenetic context. Twenty-three landmarks on the ectocranial surface of the temporal bone provide a high level of anatomical detail. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) is used to register (adjust for position, orientation and scale) landmark data from 405 adults representing Homo, Pan, Gorilla and Pongo. Principal components analysis of residuals from the GPA shows that the major source of variation is between humans and apes. Human characteristics such as a coronally orientated petrous axis, a deep mandibular fossa, a projecting mastoid process, and reduced lateral extension of the tympanic element strongly impact the analysis. In phenetic cluster analyses, gorillas and orangutans group together with respect to chimpanzees, and all apes group together with respect to humans. Thus, the analysis contradicts depictions of African apes as a single morphotype. Gorillas and orangutans lack the extensive preglenoid surface of chimpanzees, and their mastoid processes are less medially inflected. These and other characters shared by gorillas and orangutans are probably primitive for the African hominid clade.","Geometric morphometrics; Hominids; Hominoids; Relative warp analysis; Thin-plate spline analysis","Africa; analytic method; Anthropoidea; ape; article; bone structure; chimpanzee; cladistics; cluster analysis; comparative anatomy; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; evolution; fossil; geographical variation (species); geometry; gorilla; hominid; human; human versus animal comparison; mandible; mastoid; middle ear; morphometrics; morphotype; nonhuman; orang utan; Pan paniscus; petrous bone; phylogeny; priority journal; register; structure analysis; temporal bone; Adult; Animals; Gorilla gorilla; Hominidae; Humans; Pan troglodytes; Phylogeny; Pongo pygmaeus; Temporal Bone; Alocasia macrorrhizos; Animalia; Anthropoidea; Hominidae; Homo; Pan (ape); Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Paniscus; Pongo; Pongo pygmaeus; Procrustes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18744389738

Sexual dimorphic characteristics can be studied morphologically and metrically, although morphologic studies pose several problems such as difficulties with quantification and interobserver error. Geometric morphometrics is a relatively new method that allows better assessment of morphologic characteristics. This paper aims to investigate the usability of this method by assessing three different morphologic characteristics in a sample of South African blacks: shape of the greater sciatic notch, mandibular ramus flexure, and shape of the orbits. Relative warps, thin-plate splines, and canonical variates analysis (CVA) analyses were performed. As expected, the shape of the greater sciatic notch provided the best separation between the sexes. Surprisingly, however, the shape of the orbits performed better that ramus flexure. Several possible explanations for this result are possible, which include the possibility that orbit shape is more sexually dimorphic than previously expected, or that biological reality is not reflected by this technique. More research is, however, needed. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Greater sciatic notch; Orbit shape; Ramus flexure","analytic method; anatomy; article; canonical analysis; canonical variates analysis; evolution; female; geometric morphometry; geometry; human; human tissue; male; mandibular nerve; morphometrics; Negro; orbit; pelvis; quantitative analysis; sex difference; skeleton; South Africa; African Continental Ancestry Group; Body Size; Bone and Bones; Female; Humans; Male; Sex Characteristics; South Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-29244439935

The chance of attaining a high level of accuracy regarding sex allocations is related to the skeletal component analyzed and the ability of the techniques employed to describe shape and size differences among the sexes. Current opinion regards the hip bone as the most reliable sex indicator because it is the most dimorphic bone, particularly in adult individuals. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the greater sciatic notch and the ischiopubic complex morphology by employing geometric morphometric techniques, based on semilandmark and multivariate statistical methods, in order to develop a reliable and accurate technique for adult sex estimation. The sample analyzed consisted of 121 adult left hip bones randomly selected from the collection of documented skeletons housed at the Museu Antropologico de Coimbra. Morphometric analysis was based on coordinates of landmarks and semilandmarks of the ilium and ischiopubic regions that were digitized on 2D photographic images. Discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation and k-means clustering of shape and shape-size variables were used in order to classify individuals by sex. For the greater sciatic notch, average accuracy of 90.9% was achieved with both multivariate analyses based on shape variables. For the ischiopubic complex, the values obtained with shape variables were 93.4% and 90.1% for discriminant and k-means, respectively. Females were misclassified more frequently than males, especially for the ischiopubic complex. When multivariate statistical analyses were performed using shape-size variables, the percentages of correct classifications were lower than those obtained with shape variables. We conclude that the use of geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics is a reliable method to quantify pelvic shape differences between the sexes and could be applied to discriminate between females and males. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Forensic anthropologists frequently employ morphologic and metric methods for sex estimation of human remains. These methods are still very imperative in identification process in spite of the advent and accomplishment of molecular techniques. A constant boost in the use of imaging techniques in forensic anthropology research has facilitated to derive as well as revise the available population data. These methods however, are less reliable owing to high variance and indistinct landmark details. The present review discusses the reliability and reproducibility of various analytical approaches; morphological, metric, molecular and radiographic methods in sex estimation of skeletal remains. Numerous studies have shown a higher reliability and reproducibility of measurements taken directly on the bones and hence, such direct methods of sex estimation are considered to be more reliable than the other methods. Geometric morphometric (GM) method and Diagnose Sexuelle Probabiliste (DSP) method are emerging as valid methods and widely used techniques in forensic anthropology in terms of accuracy and reliability. Besides, the newer 3D methods are shown to exhibit specific sexual dimorphism patterns not readily revealed by traditional methods. Development of newer and better methodologies for sex estimation as well as re-evaluation of the existing ones will continue in the endeavour of forensic researchers for more accurate results. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Direct methods versus indirect methods; Forensic anthropology; Forensic Anthropology Population Data; Forensic sciences; Sex estimation methods; Skeletal remains","accuracy; analytic method; Article; artificial neural network; bone examination; diagnose sexuelle probabiliste; digital radiography; discriminant analysis; DNA determination; DNA fingerprinting; geometry; human; intermethod comparison; morphometrics; physical anthropology; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reproducibility; sex determination; short tandem repeat; validation process; diagnostic imaging; factual database; forensic anthropology; procedures; sex determination; sexual development; Databases, Factual; Diagnostic Imaging; Discriminant Analysis; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Sex Characteristics; Sex Determination Analysis; Sex Determination by Skeleton",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960799609

This study addresses the issue of body size and obstetric advantage. The relationship between pelvic size and three nonpelvic measures of body size is determined for females and males. The skeletal sample consists of blacks, whites, and Native Americans. The variables include 28 measures of the pelvis, length and head diameter of the femur, and clavicular length. The coefficient of multiple determination (CMD) is computed for each pelvic measure using multiple regression, with the three nonpelvic measures serving as the independent variables. Partial correlation coefficients are also calculated between each pelvic and nonpelvic variable, while controlling for the other two nonpelvic variables. The results show that all CMDs in females and all but one CMD in their CMDs for 22 of the 28 pelvic variables; of the six variables that are significantly different, five are of the midplane. The sexes are also broadly comparable in their partial correlations. The results are explained as follows. First, the concordance between the sexes in the relationship between pelvic size and nonpelvic measures of body size is due to their genetic similarity for homologous structures. Second, as pelvic size is at the minimum at the midplane, the sexual differences in CMDs are the result of selection with respect to obstetrics. Third, four explanations for the low CMDs are discussed: 1) lack of populationally or racially specific analysis; 2) nonlinear relationship between pelvic size and nonpelvic measures of body size; 3) combination of negative allometric selection between newborn body weight and maternal stature and weight with positive selection for maternal pelvic size; and 4) hormonally induced increase in pelvic capacity during parturition.

Recent research on South African skeletal material indicated that this feature may not be so reliable, especially in South African white males. In this study the greater sciatic notches of 115 known skeletons of South African origin were analysed using geometric morphometrics. Geometric morphometrics is a relatively new method that helps to quantify shape. Using this method, it was observed that South African black males have the typical narrow shape, while both the black and white females have typical wide notches. The white males, however, showed a very wide variation and their shapes scattered across the range. The shape of the greater sciatic notch is therefore not reliable to use in sex determination in this population group.

It has been shown that within a given population, taller/larger-bodied women have larger pelvic canals. This study investigates whether in a population where small body size is the norm, pelvic geometry (size and shape), on average, shows accommodation to protect the obstetric canal. Osteometric data were collected from the pelves, femora, and clavicles (body size indicators) of adult skeletons representing a range of adult body size. Samples include Holocene Later Stone Age (LSA) foragers from southern Africa (n = 28 females, 31 males), Portuguese from the Coimbra-identified skeletal collection (CISC) (n = 40 females, 40 males) and European-Americans from the Hamann-Todd osteological collection (H-T) (n = 40 females, 40 males). Patterns of sexual dimorphism are similar in the samples. Univariate and multivariate analyses of raw and Mosimann shape-variables indicate that compared to the CISC and H-T females, the LSA females have relatively large midplane and outlet canal planes (particularly posterior and A-P lengths). The LSA males also follow this pattern, although with absolutely smaller pelves in multivariate space. The CISC females, who have equally small stature, but larger body mass, do not show the same type of pelvic canal size and shape accommodation. The results suggest that adaptive allometric modeling in at least some small-bodied populations protects the obstetric canal. These findings support the use of population-specific attributes in the clinical evaluation of obstetric risk. ©2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Body size; Later Stone Age; Morphometric analysis; Pelvis","allometry; article; body height; body mass; body size; clavicle; female; femur; forager; geological time; geometry; human; inguinal canal; Late Holocene; locomotion; male; measurement; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; pelvis; sex difference; South Africa; univariate analysis; Adaptation, Biological; Analysis of Variance; Anthropometry; Body Size; Clavicle; Female; Femur; Humans; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Pelvis; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547471114

However, little work has been undertaken to determine whether neutral processes might also be influencing the postcranium, perhaps due to substantial evidence for selection and plastic environmental responses in these regions. Recent work has provided evidence for neutral effects in the pelvis, but has been limited in regard to shape data (small numbers of linear measurements) and restricted only to males. Here, we use geometric morphometric methods to examine population variation in the human os coxae (pelvic bone) in both males and females. Neutrality is examined via apportionment of variance patterns and fit to an Out-of-Africa serial founder effect model, which is known to structure neutral genetic patterns. Moreover, we compare males and females directly, and the true versus false pelvis, in order to examine potential obstetrical effects. Our results indicate evidence for substantial neutral population history effects on pelvic shape variation. They also reveal evidence for the effect of obstetrical constraints, but these affect males and females to equivalent extents. Our results do not deny an important role for selection in regard to specific aspects of human pelvic variation, especially in terms of features associated with body size and proportions. However, our analyses demonstrate that at a global level, the shape of the os coxae reveals substantial evidence for neutral variation. Our analyses thus indicate that population variation in the human pelvis might be used to address important questions concerning population history, just as the human cranium has done. © 2013 Betti et al.",,"analog digital converter; anatomic landmark; anatomic model; anatomical variation; article; body size; comparative anatomy; controlled study; female; geographic distribution; geographic origin; hip; human; human experiment; human tissue; male; mathematical computing; morphometrics; pelvic girdle; pelvis; phenotypic variation; population research; sex determination; sex difference; Biological Evolution; Female; Founder Effect; Genetics, Population; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Pelvis; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873585922

MANCOVA results show that sex and size have a significant effect on shape for both European Americans (Sex, F = 17.50, d.f. = 36, 63, p > F = 0.0001; Size, F = 2.56, d.f. = 36, 63, p > F = 0.0022) and African Americans (Sex, F = 21.18, d.f. = 36, 63, p > F = 0.0001; Size, F = 2.59, d.f. = 36, 63, p > F = 0.0005). The discriminant analysis shows that sexing accuracy for European Americans is 98% for both males and females, 98% for African American females, and 100% for African American males. © 2010 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","discriminant function analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic science; geometric morphometrics; os coxa; sex determination","adult; article; Caucasian; computer program; discriminant analysis; female; histology; human; image processing; male; methodology; Negro; pelvic girdle; physical anthropology; principal component analysis; sex determination; Adult; African Continental Ancestry Group; Discriminant Analysis; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Pelvic Bones; Principal Component Analysis; Sex Determination by Skeleton; Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954344705

J. Phys. Anthropol. 7:401-424) presented a conundrum: among primates, sexual dimorphism of the pelvis is a developmental adjunct to dimorphism in other aspects of the body, albeit in the converse direction. Among species in which males are larger than females in body size, females are larger than males in some pelvic dimensions; species with little sexual dimorphism in nonpelvic size show little pelvic dimorphism. Obstetrical difficulty does not explain this relationship. The present study addresses this issue, evaluating the relationship between pelvic and femoral sexual dimorphism in 12 anthropoid species. The hypothesis is that species in which males are significantly larger than females in femoral size will have a higher incidence, magnitude, and variability of pelvic sexual dimorphism, with females having relatively larger pelves than males, compared with species monomorphic in femoral size. The results are consistent with the hypothesis. The proposed explanation is that the default pelvic anatomy in adulthood is that of the female; testosterone redirects growth from the default type to that of the male by differentially enhancing and repressing growth among the pelvic dimensions. Testosterone also influences sexual dimorphism of the femur. The magnitude of the pelvic response to testosterone is greater in species that are sexually dimorphic in the femur than in those that are monomorphic. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Obstetrics; Pelvis; Primate; Sexual dimorphism; Testosterone; Variability","testosterone; article; body mass; female; femur head; male; measurement; nonhuman; pelvis; primate; sex difference; species differentiation; Animals; Anthropometry; Body Size; Female; Femur; Male; Pelvic Bones; Primates; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-22544478437

There is a complex relationship between selection for obstetric sufficiency and for overall body size in humans. The relationship between selective pressures may differ among populations of different body sizes and proportions, as pelvic canal dimensions vary among populations. Size and shape of the pelvic canal in relation to body size and shape were examined using nine skeletal samples (total female n = 57; male n = 84) from diverse geographical regions. Pelvic, vertebral, and lower limb bone measurements were collected. Principal component analyses demonstrate pelvic canal size and shape differences among the samples. Male multivariate variance in pelvic shape is greater than female variance for North and South Africans. High-latitude samples have larger and broader bodies, and pelvic canals of larger size and, among females, relatively broader medio-lateral dimensions relative to low-latitude samples, which tend to display relatively expanded inlet antero-posterior (A-P) and posterior canal dimensions. Differences in canal shape exist among samples that are not associated with latitude or body size, suggesting independence of some canal shape characteristics from body size and shape. The South Africans are distinctive with very narrow bodies and small pelvic inlets relative to an elongated lower canal in A-P and posterior lengths. Variation in pelvic canal geometry among populations is consistent with a high degree of evolvability in the human pelvis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","body proportions; ecogeographic variation; morphometric analysis; obstetric selection; pelvis","article; body build; body size; female; human; latitude; leg; male; morphology; morphometrics; pelvis; principal component analysis; Analysis of Variance; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Body Size; Continental Population Groups; Female; Femur; Humans; Male; Pelvic Bones; Principal Component Analysis; Sex Factors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876464940

There is, however, a theoretical problem in interpreting a pattern of variation as evidence of selection without first accounting for the effects of neutral evolutionary processes (i.e., mutation, genetic drift and migration). Here, we analyse 3D configurations of 27 landmarks on the os coxae of 1494 modern human individuals representing 30 male and 23 female populations from five continents and a range of climatic conditions. We test for the effects of climate on the size and shape of the pelvic bone, while explicitly accounting for population history (i.e., geographically-mediated gene flow and genetic drift). We find that neutral processes account for a substantial proportion of shape variance in the human os coxae in both sexes. Beyond the neutral pattern due to population history, temperature is a significant predictor of shape and size variation in the os coxae, at least in males. The effect of climate on the shape of the pelvic bone, however, is comparatively limited, explaining only a small percentage of shape variation in males and females. In accordance with previous hypotheses, the size of the os coxae tends to increase with decreasing temperature, although the significance of the association is reduced when population history is taken into account. In conclusion, the shape and size of the human os coxae reflect both neutral evolutionary processes and climatically-driven adaptive changes. Neutral processes have a substantial effect on pelvic variation, suggesting such factors will need to be taken into account in future studies of human and fossil hominin coxal variation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate; Neutral variation; Pelvis; Selection","bone; climate conditions; climate effect; fossil; hominid; human evolution; selection; shape; size; adaptation; anatomy and histology; climate; evolution; female; genetic drift; human; male; migration; pelvic girdle; Adaptation, Biological; Biological Evolution; Climate; Female; Genetic Drift; Human Migration; Humans; Male; Pelvic Bones",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905754659

Some workers have proposed that the structure of the female primate pelvis is influenced by the presence of the birth canal, but others have sought to explain pelvic dimorphism as the allometric consequence of differences in body size between the sexes. Measurements of five pelvic dimensions together with the length of the femur (an indicator of overall body size) were obtained for several species of primates including modern man. In some species the females exhibit differential pelvic growth, resulting in a difference between the size dimorphism of the pelvis and that of the femur. Differential female pelvic growth is confined to pelvic dimensions that are related to the size of the birth canal, confirming previous suggestions that relative neonatal size is a determinant of pelvic dimorphism in primates. © 1986 Academic Press Inc.

Levels of variation in three skeletal regions (pelvic canal, noncanal pelvis, and limbs) of females and males are compared to each other and between sexes. Methods: Nine human skeletal samples (total female n=101; male n=117) representing diverse populations were included. Osteometric data were collected from the articulated pelvis, os coxa, sacrum, femur, tibia, humerus, radius, and clavicle. Coefficients of variation, adjusted for small sample size (V*), were calculated for variables in separate samples by sex, and mean V*s were taken for the skeletal regions. Size variances were measured as V* of the geometric mean (GM) of the skeletal region variables. Using nonparametric methods, coefficients were compared between sexes and skeletal regions and correlations among V*s were calculated. Results: Females and males do not differ in levels of variation for any skeletal region. The pelvic canal is the most variable region in both sexes, while size variability (GM) is similar among the three skeletal regions. Across the samples, canal and noncanal pelvic regions share patterns of variability in females but not males, while variability of the limb skeleton is independent in both sexes. Conclusions: The results suggest that stabilizing selection does not limit variability in the female pelvic canal. Biological plasticity may be greater in the canal than that in other skeletal regions. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"anthropometry; article; bones of the arm and hand; female; genetic selection; histology; human; leg; male; pelvic girdle; sexual development; Anthropometry; Arm Bones; Female; Humans; Leg Bones; Male; Pelvic Bones; Selection, Genetic; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886286477

Probabilistic Sex Diagnosis (DSP: Diagnose Sexuelle Probabiliste) developed by Murail et al., in 2005, is a sex determination method based on a worldwide hip bone metrical database. Sex is determined by comparing specific measurements taken from each specimen using sliding callipers and computing the probability of specimens being female or male. In forensic science it is sometimes not possible to sex a body due to corpse decay or injury. Skeletalization and dissection of a body is a laborious process and desecrates the body. There were two aims to this study. The first aim was to examine the accuracy of the DSP method in comparison with a current visual sexing method on sex determination. A further aim was to see if it was possible to virtually utilise the DSP method on both the hip bone and the pelvic girdle in order to utilise this method for forensic sciences.For the first part of the study, forty-nine dry hip bones of unknown sex were obtained from the Body Donation Programme of the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). A comparison was made between DSP analysis and visual sexing on dry bone by two researchers. CT scans of bones were then analysed to obtain three-dimensional (3D) virtual models and the method of DSP was analysed virtually by importing the models into a customised software programme called lhpFusionBox which was developed at ULB. The software enables DSP distances to be measured via virtually-palpated bony landmarks. There was found to be 100% agreement of sex between the manual and virtual DSP method. The second part of the study aimed to further validate the method by analysing thirty-nine supplementary pelvic girdles of known sex blind. There was found to be a 100% accuracy rate further demonstrating that the virtual DSP method is robust. Statistically significant differences were found in the identification of sex between researchers in the visual sexing method although both researchers identified the same sex in all cases in the manual and virtual DSP methods for both the hip bones and pelvic girdles. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Forensic; LhpFusionBox; Pelvis; Sex determination; Sexing","article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; female; forensic science; gender identity; human; image analysis; intermethod comparison; linear system; male; measurement accuracy; pelvic girdle; pelvis; priority journal; sex determination; three dimensional imaging; validation study; virtual reality; Forensic; LhpFusionBox; Pelvis; Sex determination; Sexing; Adult; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Pelvic Bones; Sex Determination by Skeleton; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891346784

We tested the robustness of GSN sex classification on the basis of geometric morphometrics (GM) and support vector machines (SVM), using two different population samples. Using photographs, the shape of the GSN in 229 samples from two assemblages (documented collections of a Euroamerican population from the Maxwell Museum, University of New Mexico, and a Hispanic population from Universidad Nacional Autõnoma de México, Mexico City) was segmented automatically and evaluated using six curve representations. The optimal dimensionality for each representation was determined by finding the best sex classification. The classification accuracy of the six curve representations in our study was similar but the highest and concurrently homologous cross-validated accuracy of 92% was achieved for a pooled sample using Fourier coefficient and Legendre polynomial methods. The success rate of our classification was influenced by the number of semilandmarks or coefficients and was only slightly affected by GSN marginal point positions. The intrapopulation variability of the female GSN shape was significantly lower compared with the male variability, possibly as a consequence of the intense selection pressure associated with reproduction. Males were misclassified more often than females. Our results show that by using a suitable GSN curve representation, a GM approach, and SVM analysis, it is possible to obtain a robust separation between the sexes that is stable for a multipopulation sample.

Firstly, intra- and interobserver error associated with the placement of point coordinates in geometric morphometric analyses were evaluated through intraclass correlation coefficient and Kappa index. Our results indicate that such techniques, in contrast to morphoscopic analysis, allow quantification and objective description of sexual dimorphism in pelvic traits, as well as, performing repeated analyses of numerous individuals with no previous observer experience required. Secondly, relative warp analyses calculated based on semilandmarks were used to describe sexual dimorphism pattern of the ischiopubic region and the greater sciatic notch of two unknown sex Amerindian samples from Argentina, and k-means clustering analysis was applied to detect two groups within each sample. One sample corresponds to hunter-gatherers from South Argentina (n = 29), whereas the other comprises farmers from Northwest Argentina (n = 30). The results obtained suggest that: (a) the first relative warps axis obtained for both structures summarizes shape changes due to sexual dimorphism; (b) the individuals grouped into clusters can be assigned as female or male based on their shape; and (c) sexual dimorphism is not equally expressed in both archaeological samples. These findings support the hypothesis that patterns of pelvic sexual dimorphism vary among human populations and thus, criteria for sexing are population-specific. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

There is evidence that microevolutionary processes, both neutral (i.e., population history) and selective (e.g., thermoregulatory adaptation and size-related obstetrical constraints) contribute to explain pelvic variation among populations, but the extent to which these factors affect pelvic sexual dimorphism is unknown. In this study, I analyze sexual dimorphism of the os coxae in 20 globally distributed human populations, using 3D morphometric data to separate the size and shape components of sexual differences. After evaluating population differences in the degree and pattern of sexual dimorphism, I test for the effect of population history, climate, and body size in shaping global diversity. The results show that size and shape dimorphism follow different patterns. Coxal size dimorphism is generally quite consistent through populations, with males bigger than females, but it appears to be reduced in small-bodied populations, possibly in relation to obstetrically-related selective pressures for a spacious birth canal. Beyond a general species-wide pattern of shape dimorphism, commonly used for forensic sex determination, other aspects of sexual differences in coxal shape vary among human populations, reflecting the effects of neutral demographic processes and climatic adaptation. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","climate; obstetrical constraints; pelvis; population history","anatomical variation; article; body mass; body size; climate; demography; evolution; female; hip; hip shape; hip size; human; male; morphometrics; musculoskeletal system parameters; pelvis; pubic bone; sex determination; sex difference; climate; obstetrical constraints; pelvis; population history; Analysis of Variance; Anthropology, Physical; Biological Evolution; Body Size; Female; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Male; Pelvic Bones; Sex Characteristics; Somatotypes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892577557

Several tools have been developed using different osseous structures. With the intention to provide an objective method comparison, we reported the analysis of three different methods (visual, metric and geometric morphometrics) for sex assessment of the greater sciatic notch. One hundred and thirty pelvic bones (45.4% females and 54.6% males) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico Skeletal Collection pertaining to the contemporary Mexican population were analyzed.We used the ROC-analysis to test between desired false positive thresholds (1-specificity) and expected true positive rates (sensitivity) in order to predict the best approach to sex assessment. The comparison of the area under the ROC-curves shows significant differences among visual and metric methods. At the same time, the analysis suggested that higher morphological variation among the sexes is independent of the methodological approach.The results indicate that the metric (angle), with a high percent of indeterminate cases (34.6%), and visual, with 26.2% of the cases allocated as intermediate cases, were poorly accurate; we cannot recommend these techniques for sexing an unknown specimen. On the other hand, the geometric morphometrics approach improves sex estimation in 82.3% of correctly classified individuals with more than 95% of posterior probability.In addition to the method comparison, the major sexual variation of the greater sciatic notch was determined to be located on its posterior border. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Forensic anthropology population data; Forensic osteology; Geometric morphometrics; Greater sciatic notch; Sex diagnosis","accuracy; adult; aged; angular morphometrics; area under the curve; article; false positive result; female; forensic identification; geometric morphometrics; Hispanic; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; male; methodology; morphometrics; pelvic girdle; physical anthropology; prediction; priority journal; probability; receiver operating characteristic; sciatic notch; sensitivity and specificity; sex determination; sex difference; visual morphometrics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864326754

Given the abundance of potentially confounding evolutionary and mechanical factors influencing pelvic form, it is important to tease apart the effects of shape and size in the major component of the primate pelvis, the os coxae. However, os coxae form is difficult to assess via traditional morphometric methods. Here, we adopt a 3D geometric morphometric approach to landmark data. Our analyses included data from 30 extant catarrhine taxa. Data were transformed and registered using Procrustes analysis and analyzed via examination of principal components. Two analyses were performed: one excluding Homo sapiens, and a second including them. Results of the first analysis demonstrate that the total diversity of os coxae morphology is significantly greater in hominoids than it is in cercopithecoids. This appears to be driven by the greater effects of size diversity (i.e., allometric effects) in the case of the hominoids. This analysis also revealed a clear taxonomic/phylogenetic distinction between hominoids and cercopithecoids in terms of os coxae shape. The second analysis showed that Procrustes distances in shape space are significantly greater between extant Pan and Homo than they are between any two non-human catarrhine taxa. This analysis thus quantifies, on a comparative basis, the dramatic effect that the course of hominin evolution had upon the morphology of the human pelvis, within what is - even by catarrhine standards - a relatively short span of evolutionary time. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Allometry; Catarrhines; Geometric morphometrics; Os coxae; Pelvis","allometry; anthropology; comparative study; evolution; geometry; hominid; human evolution; morphometry; paleontology; phylogenetics; taxonomy; Cercopithecoidea; Homo; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875229368

Despite this female-specific stabilizing selection, variability of linear dimensions of the pelvic canal and overall size are not reduced in females, suggesting shape may instead be variable among females of a population. Female canal shape has been shown to vary among populations, while male canal shape does not. Within this context, we examine within-population canal shape variation in comparison with that of noncanal aspects of the pelvis and the limbs. Materials and Methods Nine skeletal samples (total female n = 101, male n = 117) representing diverse body sizes and shapes were included. Principal components analysis was applied to size-adjusted variables of each skeletal region. A multivariate variance was calculated using the weighted PC scores for all components in each model and F-ratios used to assess differences in within-population variances between sexes and skeletal regions. Results Within both sexes, multivariate canal shape variance is significantly greater than noncanal pelvis and limb variances, while limb variance is greater than noncanal pelvis variance in some populations. Multivariate shape variation is not consistently different between the sexes in any of the skeletal regions.

Compromised growth in females may result in contracted pelvic dimensions and elevated risk of cephalopelvic disproportion. The basis for the use of clinical pelvic contracture thresholds for evaluating health and growth in skeletal populations is examined through comparisons of contracture frequencies and the relationships between pelvic canal size and body size in 11 skeletal samples (total . n=. 195). The small-bodied samples show higher frequencies of contracted inlet and midplane posterior space dimensions. Canal breadth is correlated with femoral head diameter and bi-iliac breadth, but not femoral length. These results suggest that modern clinical standards do not take into account the variation in human body size and shape and the effect this variation may have on obstetric capacity without compromising obstetric function. It is problematic to use small pelvic dimensions, in the absence of evidence of death during childbirth, to infer compromised obstetric function resulting from biological stress, as is assuming that small size represents compromised skeletal growth. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..","Cephalopelvic disproportion; Obstetrics; Skeletal size",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857233295

In the present study sex was determined for 354 skeletons from the medieval Swedish town Sigtuna, using well-recognized sexing techniques on the pelvis, skull and femur. The preservation of the skeletons varied markedly, thus affecting possibilities for sex assessments. An attempt was made to evaluate the result of the sex assessment when weighting of different traits with different scales was used. The resulting estimation for each individual was called total mean value A. In addition, a total mean value B that considers unobservable missing traits was estimated.

This article investigates the sexual dimorphism of the human sacro-iliac joint, using geometric morphometric techniques that assess morphological characters better than the traditional approaches for recording outline shapes, which are subject to quantification and inter-observer problems. Eight two-dimensional landmarks were recorded from digital images of 29 female and 35 male auricular surfaces of the ilium and sacrum. The specimens were analyzed using geometric morphometric methods (Generalized Procrustes analysis, relative warp analysis, Goodall's F) and multivariate statistics (ANOVA, MANCOVA, principal component analysis, discriminant function analysis [DFA]). Both the size and shape of the analyzed structures were found to be sexually dimorphic. The DFA illustrated that when the form of both the iliac and sacral articular surface is taken as a predictor variable, 94.5% of the individuals are assigned to the correct sex. The successful sex determination obtained by the DFA makes the further study of the sacro-iliac joint's sexual dimorphism promising. © 2012 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","Auricular surface; Discriminant function analysis; Forensic science; Geometric morphometrics; Procrustes coordinates; Sacro-iliac joint; Sexual dimorphism; Thin-plate spline","adult; analysis of variance; article; computer program; discriminant analysis; female; histology; human; image processing; male; methodology; middle aged; photography; physical anthropology; principal component analysis; sacroiliac joint; sex determination; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Photography; Principal Component Analysis; Sacroiliac Joint; Sex Determination by Skeleton; Software; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872311195

The purposes of the present study are to (1) evaluate the success rate of this proposed method using modern American os coxae from different population subgroups; (2) compare the success rate of the new method with that obtained using traditional techniques; and (3) determine replicability of the new method and interobserver error. Eight hundred and seventy-six adult left os coxae were independently evaluated by both authors. Summary statistics for sex classifications were calculated for the total sample and for a random sample of 400 individuals. The impact of sex and ancestry on the success of each method was calculated on the random sample using Pearson's χ2 values. Results demonstrate that for modern American os coxae, neither sex nor race have a significant impact on the success rate for either the new or traditional methods (p&lt;0.01). Additionally, the success rate of the new method is comparable with that obtained using traditional techniques. Finally, interobserver error using the new method for overall sex determination is low.

The study aimed at connecting obstetrical adaptations in Catarrhines with (1) locomotor specializations in the pelvic cavity, and (2) neonate encephalization. The material comprised 49 pelves, 18 skulls of adult females, and 9 neonate skulls. The neonate dimensions were placed in the pelvic inlet, midplane and outlet (mean pelvic shape obtained by Procrustes superimposition) and compared with adult dimensions. The results showed that non-human primates possess simple obstetrical mechanics that may present some difficulties, either because the fetus is proportionally large (Hylobates), or because locomotor specializations reduce the pelvic dimensions (Papio). Humans have complex obstetrical mechanics, resulting from bipedalism and parturition interactions. Encephalization did not play a determinant role in the evolution of human obstetrics.

In the 1990's, this field, which has not altered its focus upon the quantitative analysis of biomedical shape variation and shape change, was principally centered around concerns of medical image analysis; but now it is driven mainly by the demands of researchers in human variability, physical anthropology, primatology, and paleoanthropology instead.
