These methods show differences in shape among specimens as residuals after rotation, translation, and scaling them so that they align as well as possible. A new method is presented that generalizes Siegel and Benson's (1982) resistant-fit theta-rho analysis so that more than two objects can be compared at the same time. Both least-squares and resistant-fit approaches are generalized to allow for affine transformations (uniform shape change). The methods are compared, using artificial data and data on 18 landmarks on the wings of 127 species of North American mosquitoes.

This paper demonstrates that the preshape space of planar triangles Procrustes aligned to a reference triangle corresponds to a unit hemisphere. An overview of methods used as linear approximations of D. G. Kendall's non-Euclidean shape space is given, and the equivalence of several methods based on orthogonal projections is shown. Some problems with approximations based on stereographic projections are also discussed.

The Gelasian until then had been the uppermost stage of the Pliocene Series/Epoch. The base of the Gelasian corresponds to Marine Isotope Stage 103, and has an astronomically tuned age of 2.58 Ma. A proposal that the base of the Pleistocene Series/Epoch be lowered to coincide with that of the Quaternary (the Gelasian GSSP) was also accepted by the IUGS Executive Committee. The GSSP at Vrica, Calabria, Italy, which had hitherto defined the basal boundary of both the Quaternary and the Pleistocene, remains available as the base of the Calabrian Stage/Age (now the second stage of the revised Pleistocene). In ratifying these proposals, the IUGS has acknowledged the distinctive qualities of the Quaternary by reaffirming it as a full system/period, correctly complied with the hierarchical requirements of the geological timescale by lowering the base of the Pleistocene to that of the Quaternary, and fully respected the historical and widespread current usage of both the terms 'Quaternary' and 'Pleistocene'. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Gelasian; Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP); Pleistocene; Quaternary; Quaternary/Pleistocene lower boundary","geochronology; marine isotope stage; Pleistocene; Pliocene; Quaternary; stratotype; Calabria; Caltanissetta; Italy; Monte San Nicola; Sicily",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-74349122804

In contrast with the uncertain taxonomic affinity of the mandible, the new fossils are comparable in size and morphology with Homo ergaster from Koobi Fora, Kenya. Paleontological, archaeological, geochronological, and paleomagnetic data from Dmanisi all indicate an earliest Pleistocene age of about 1.7 million years ago, supporting correlation of the new specimens with the Koobi Fora fossils.

However, the purportedly oldest of the Early Pleistocene sites in Eurasia lack precise age control and contain stone tools rather than human fossil remains. Here we report the discovery of a human mandible associated with an assemblage of Mode 1 lithic tools and faunal remains bearing traces of hominin processing, in stratigraphic level TE9 at the site of the Sima del Elefante, Atapuerca, Spain. Level TE9 has been dated to the Early Pleistocene (approximately 1.2-1.1 Myr), based on a combination of palaeomagnetism, cosmogenic nuclides and biostratigraphy. The Sima del Elefante site thus emerges as the oldest, most accurately dated record of human occupation in Europe, to our knowledge. The study of the human mandible suggests that the first settlement of Western Europe could be related to an early demographic expansion out of Africa. The new evidence, with previous findings in other Atapuerca sites (level TD6 from Gran Dolina), also suggests that a speciation event occurred in this extreme area of the Eurasian continent during the Early Pleistocene, initiating the hominin lineage represented by the TE9 and TD6 hominins. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,"anthropology; biostratigraphy; cosmogenic radionuclide; fossil assemblage; hominid; human settlement; occupation; paleomagnetism; Pleistocene; article; biostratigraphy; hominid; human; Lower Pleistocene; magnetism; mandible; paleoanthropology; priority journal; Spain; species differentiation; Western Europe; Burgos [Castilla y Leon]; Castilla y Leon; Eurasia; Europe; Sima del Elefante; Southern Europe; Spain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41349095733

Since its synonimization into Homo, views of the species and its distribution have varied from a single, widely dispersed, polytypic species ultimately ancestral to all later Homo, to a derived, regional isolate ultimately marginal to later hominin evolution. A revised chronostratigraphic framework and recent work bearing either directly or indirectly on reconstructions of life-history patterns are reviewed here and, together with a review of the cranial and postcranial anatomy of H. erectus, are used to generate a natural history of the species. Here I argue that H. erectus is a hominin, notable for its increased body size, that originates in the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene of Africa and quickly disperses into Western and Eastern Asia. It is also an increasingly derived hominin with several regional morphs sustained by intermittent isolation, particularly in Southeast Asia. This view differs from several current views, most especially that which recognizes only a single hominin species in the Pleistocene, H. sapiens, and those which would atomize H. erectus into a multiplicity of taxa. Following Jolly ([2001] Yrbk Phys Anthropol 44:177-204), the regional morphs of H. erectus may be productively viewed as geographically replacing allotaxa, rather than as the focus of unresolvable species debates. Such a view allows us to focus on the adaptations and biology of local groups, including questions of biogeographic isolation and local adaptation. A number of issues remain unresolved, including the significance of diversity in size and shape in the early African and Georgian records. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Africa; China; Dispersal; H. ergaster; Indonesia; Life history","anatomical variation; anatomy; biodiversity; biogeographic region; chronosequence; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; geographic distribution; history; hominid; homo erectus; human; life history; Pliocene; review; stratigraphy; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Pithecanthropus",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0942301483

One of the earliest direct evidences for fossil hominins in western Europe comes from an infilled karstic cave site called Gran Dolina at Atapuerca, in a stratum ∼1.5 m below the Brunhes-Matuyama (B-M) geomagnetic boundary (780 ka) within lithostratigraphic unit TD6. However, most of the meters of fossil- and tool-bearing strata at Gran Dolina have been difficult to date. Therefore, we applied both thermoluminescence (TL) and infrared-stimulated-luminescence (IRSL) multi-aliquot dating methods to fine-silt fractions from sediment samples within Gran Dolina and the nearby Galería cave site. We also applied these methods to samples from the present-day surface soils on the surrounding limestone hill slopes to test the luminescence-clock-zeroing-by-daylight assumption. Within the uppermost 4 m of the cave deposits at Gran Dolina, TL and paired TL and IRSL ages range stratigraphically from 198 ± 19 ka to 244 ± 26 ka. Throughout Gran Dolina, all luminescence results are stratigraphically self-consistent and, excepting results from two stratigraphic units, are consistent with prior ESR-U-series ages from progressively deeper strata. Thermoluminescence ages culminate at 960 ± 120 ka approximately 1 m below the 780 ka B-M boundary. At Galería, with one exception, TL and IRSL ages range stratigraphically downward from 185 ± 26 ka to 503 ± 95 ka at the base of the lowermost surface-inwash facies. These results indicate that TL and (sometimes) IRSL are useful dating tools for karstic inwash sediments older than ca. 100 ka, and that a more accurate chronostratigraphic correlation is now possible among the main Atapuerca sites (Gran Dolina, Galería, Sima de los Huesos).

Most attention has focused recently on the evidence for or against a late Pliocene dispersal, ca. 1.8 Ma., of hominids out of Africa into Asia and possibly southern Europe. Here, the focus is widened to include North Africa as well as southern Asia and Europe, as well as the evidence in these regions for hominids after their first putative appearance ca. 1.8 Ma. It suggests that overall there is very little evidence for hominids in most of these regions before the Middle Pleistocene. Consequently, it concludes that the colonising capabilities of Homo erectus may have been seriously over-rated, and that even if hominids did occupy parts of North Africa, southern Europe and southern Asia shortly after 2 Ma, there is little evidence of colonisation. Whilst further fieldwork will doubtless slowly fill many gaps in a poorly documented Lower Pleistocene hominid record, it appears premature to conclude that the appearance of hominids in North Africa, Europe and Asia was automatically followed by permanent settlement. Rather, current data are more consistent with the view that Lower Pleistocene hominid populations outside East Africa were often spatially and temporally discontinuous, that hominid expansion was strongly constrained by latitude, and that occupation of temperate latitudes north of latitude 40° was largely confined to interglacial periods. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the lake beds contain a wide range of micromammals including Mimomys savini and Allophaiomys burgondiae and large mammals such as Mammuthus and Hippopotamus together with the African saber-toothed felid Megantereon. The association of the lithic artifacts along with the fossil assemblages, themselves of prime significance in the Eurasian mammal biochronology, is providing new insight into the controversy of the human settlement in Southern Europe. Despite the importance of the artifacts and fossil assemblage, estimates of the geological age of the site are still in conflict. Some attempts at dating the sediments have included biochronology, uranium series, amino acid racemization, and stratigraphic correlation with other well-dated sections in the basin, but so far have failed to yield unambiguous ages. Here we present paleomagnetic age dating at the relevant localities and thus provide useful age constraints for this critical paleoanthropological and mammal site.

The lithic industry, composed by three cores and some flakes, has been found to be associated to an Early Pleistocene vertebrate fossil assemblage. The fossil association contains a wide range of micromammals, including Allophaiomys ruffoi and Episoriculus gibberodon and large mammals including Bison degiulii and Equus altidens together with African elements as the gelada baboon Theropithecus and the saber-toothed cat Megantereon whitei. It defines the latest Villafranchian chronological unit (Pirro Nord Faunal Unit) in the Western European mammal biochronology. The lithic industry of Pirro Nord represents the oldest occurrence of the genus Homo in Europe as it is attributable to a chronological interval between 1.3 and 1.7 Ma. This supports the hypothesis that the genus Homo, with Oldowaian technology, extended its range in Europe, probably from western Asia, during the first half of the Early Pleistocene.

This paper addresses two aspects of the debate, one dealing with the chronology of occupation, which is put to use in the second issue, an exploration of the behaviour of the earliest occupants of Europe. The review of the debate on chronology concludes that a short chronology applies to Europe north of the large mountain chains of the Alps and the Pyrences, where the earliest traces of a human presence date back to about half a million years ago. In this phased-colonisation model, the Mediterranean, and especially Spain, saw an earlier occupation, starting around the end of the Lower Pleistocene. The archaeological record of these first Europeans suggests that from the first presence in northern Europe onwards, regular hunting of large game was common practice among Middle Pleistocene hominids. By situating this archaeological evidence in the context of findings from a range of other disciplines I develop a behavioural scenario which suggests that, at its latest by the Middle Pleistocene, increased forms of social cooperation, exchange of information within larger groups and in general forms of behaviour based on a ""release from proximity"" had become a standard ingredient of the hominid behavioural repertoire.","Colonization; Europe; Hominid behaviour; Hunting; Palaeolithic; Pleistocene","archaeological evidence; behavior; hunting; Pleistocene; (Northern); Europe; Hominidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035153958

This assumption also seems to apply for the Early and Middle Pleistocene populations, whose presence in Europe has been largely explained by a discontinuous flow of African emigrant waves. Only recently, some voices have speculated about the possibility of Asia being a center of speciation. However, no hard evidence has been presented to support this hypothesis. We present evidence from the most complete and up-to-date analysis of the hominin permanent dentition from Africa and Eurasia.

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549154351

ATD6-96 is the left half of a gracile mandible belonging to a probably female adult individual with premolars and molars in place. This mandible shows a primitive structural pattern shared with all African and Asian Homo species. However, it is small and exhibits a remarkable gracility, a trait shared only with the Early and Middle Pleistocene Chinese hominins.

The study of Lower Paleolithic sites in this region and in the neighboring Caucasus area sheds some light on several potential colonization events. Sites such as 'Ubeidiya (Jordan Valley) and Dmanisi (Georgia) suggest the early sorties took place around 1.4-1.0 Ma. Despite the lack of radiometric dates, sequences of raised beaches, marine deposits, river terraces, and paleolake formations have enabled various investigators to identify several series of major aggradation and erosion periods within the Pleistocene. Lithic assemblages derived from a few systematic excavations and collections from stratigraphically dated outcrops led to a threefold subdivision of the Acheulian sequence into the Lower, Middle, and Upper Acheulian. The study of nonbiface assemblages, however, has not resolved the question of whether these assemblages deserve inclusion as separate entities or should be viewed as sites within the Acheulian settlement pattern. While the typotechnological definitions of each major phase can be compared to what is known from other regions of the Old World, the Acheulo-Yabrudian (or the Mugharan Tradition) is seen as a local entity.

Next, the appearance of a recognisably modern type of human behaviour is considered; an assessment is made of how human societies were affected by climatic and environmental changes.

Among the principal difficulties in these evaluations is the absence of discrete, discernible, and comparable anatomical structures for rigorous quantitative assessment. Previous research has addressed either internal crown surface features (such as cusps and fossae) or the morphology of the crown outline. In the present paper, we integrate both types of information in the examination of morphological variation of lower P4s (n = 96) among various fossil hominin species with an emphasis on genus Homo. We use a set of 34 2D landmarks combining coordinate data from four classical dental landmarks on the occlusal surface and 30 sliding semilandmarks of the crown outline. Our results indicate that external shape variation is closely related to the configuration of the occlusal morphological features and influenced by dental size. The external and internal shapes of P4 are polymorphic but still useful in depicting a primitive-derived gradient. The primitive pattern seems to have been an asymmetrical contour with a mesially displaced metaconid, development of a bulging talonid, and a broad occlusal polygon. The trend toward dental reduction during the Pleistocene produced different morphological variants with a reduced occlusal polygon and decreased lingual occlusal surface in later Homo species. Homo heidelbergensis/neanderthalensis have fixed plesiomorphic traits in high percentages, whereas in modern humans a symmetrical outline with a centered metaconid and talonid reduction evolved. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Usually these analyses have been performed by means of classic morphometric methods, including the measurement of relative cusp areas or the angles defined between cusps. Although these studies have provided valuable information for the morphological characterization of some hominin species, we believe that the analysis of this particular tooth could be more conclusive for taxonomic assignment. In this study, we have applied geometric morphometric methods to explore the morphological variability of the upper first molar (M1) across the human fossil record. Our emphasis focuses on the study of the phenetic relationships among the European middle Pleistocene populations (designated as H. heidelbergensis) with H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, but the inclusion of Australopithecus and early Homo specimens has helped us to assess the polarity of the observed traits. H. neanderthalensis presents a unique morphology characterized by a relatively distal displacement of the lingual cusps and protrusion in the external outline of a large and bulging hypocone. This morphology can be found in a less pronounced degree in the European early and middle Pleistocene populations, and reaches its maximum expression with the H. neanderthalensis lineage. In contrast, modern humans retain the primitive morphology with a square occlusal polygon associated with a round external outline. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This nomen, formulated by Schoetensack in 1908 to describe the Mauer jaw (Germany), was almost forgotten during most of the past century. Numerous fossils have been attributed to it but no consensus has arisen concerning their classification. The holotype anatomical traits are still poorly understood, and numerous fossils with no mandibular remains have been placed in the taxon. Some researchers propose H. heidelbergensis as an Afro-European taxon that is ancestral to both modern humans and Neandertals whereas others think it is a strictly European species that is part of the Neandertal lineage. We focus on the validity of H. heidelbergensis, using the traditional basis of species recognition: anatomical description. We provide a comparative morphological analysis using 47 anatomical traits of 36 Pleistocene fossils from Africa, Asia, and Europe and 35 extant human mandibles. We re-examine the mandibular features of Mauer and discuss the specimen's inclusion in H. heidelbergensis, as well as alternative evolutionary theories. To lend objectivity to specimen grouping, we use multiple correspondence analysis associated with hierarchical classification that creates clusters corresponding to phenetic similarities between jaws. Our phenetic and comparative morphological analyses support the validity of H. heidelbergensis as a taxon. A set of morphological features can be statistically identified for the definition of the species. Some traits can be used to delimit H. heidelbergensis in an evolutionary framework (e.g., foramina mentale posteriorly positioned, horizontal retromolar surface). Those traits are also present on African (e.g., Tighenif) and European (e.g., Sima de los Huesos) specimens that show a close relationship with the Mauer mandible. Therefore, the definition of H. heidelbergensis is more precise and mainly supports the theory of an Afro-European taxon, which is the last common ancestor of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. However, the results of this study fail to entirely discount the hypothesis that considers H. heidelbergensis as a chronospecies leading to the Neandertals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The taxonomic allocation of the teeth, which represent at least 46 individuals, was based on nondental evidence. Specimens were allocated to one of two major taxonomic categories, (EAFROB or EAFHOM), East African Homo erectus (EAFHER), or their taxonomic affinity was regarded as 'unknown' (N = 17). Information about the root system was derived from radiography and direct observation. Morphometric data were in the form of nine linear and two angular measurements based on eighteen reference points. Root form was also assessed using a scheme which recognised four classes of root morphology. Data were compared using both univariate and multivariate techniques, including Principal Component and Canonical Variate analysis. Posterior probabilities derived from the latter were used (in a two-taxon design model) to assess the affinities of the 'unknown' specimens. The variation in hominid mandibular premolar root form was interpreted as two morphoclines, based on the presumed primitive condition of the P3 (with mesiobuccal and distal roots, 2R: MB and D) and P4 (with mesial and distal root, 2R: M and D) root systems. One trend apparently leads towards root reduction (i.e. P3 = 1 R; P4 = 1 R), and the other to root elaboration (i.e. P3 and P4 = 2R:M and D). The extreme form of the latter is the 'molarisation' of the premolar roots seen in EAFROB. Despite major differences in root form there was relatively little taxonomic variation in root metrics, except for a more robust distal root system in EAFROB. Molar root form showed little interspecific variation except for M2 in which the roots in EAFROB were larger and more robust, with differences in root height being greater for the distal than for the mesial roots. Root form and metrics enable four of the 'unknown' specimens (KMN-ER 819, 1482, 1483 and 1801) to be tentatively allocated to EAFHOM, and a single specimen, KMN-ER 3731, to EAFROB. Published assessments of the root morphology of the 'robust' australopithecines from Swartkrans suggest that the premolar root form of Australopithecus (Paranthropus) robustus is not obviously intermediate between the presumed ancestral condition, and the 'molarised' mandibular premolar root systems of Australopithecus (Paranthropus) boisei.",,"adult; hominid; human cell; mandible; methodology; molar tooth root; morphology; morphometrics; pleistocene; tooth; Africa, Eastern; Bicuspid; Comparative Study; Cuspid; Evolution; Female; Fossils; History of Medicine, Ancient; Human; Male; Mandible; Paleodontology; Paleontology; Statistics; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Tooth Root",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023876808

The TD6 dental sample consists of two deciduous and 28 permanent teeth, belonging to a minimum of six individuals. Paleomagnetic analyses of the TD sequence suggest an age for the Aurora stratum of greater than 780 ka. The associated fossil macro- and micrommals are consistent with a date for the Atapuerca-TD6 hominids at the end of the Early Pleistocene. As a whole, the size of the TD6 teeth is large and comparable to that of the African Lower Pleistocene hominids. Most morphological dental traits are plesiomorphic for the genus Homo, whereas the shape analysis has revealed some size-related trends that differ from those seen in early Homo. Thus, the relative size increase of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth and buccolingual diameter of the first molars, the reduction of the third molars and lower canines, and the P3&gt;P4 size sequence are all characteristic of the population represented by the TD6 hominids. The morphological evidence suggests that the TD6 hominids are closer to African Lower and early Middle Pleistocene hominids than they are to European Middle Pleistocene hominids. However, some dental traits of the TD6 hominids, such as the expansion of the anterior teeth, the P3&gt;P4 size sequence, and the morphology of the lower canine also suggest an evolutionary continuity between the population represented by these hominids and the European Middle Pleistocene population. Furthermore, dental evidence indicates that the TD6 hominids are clearly distinct from Asian H. erectus. Dental evidence also suggests that the TD6 hominids could represent an evolutionary connection between H. ergaster and H. heidelbergensis.

After the analysis of the lower second premolar and the upper first molar crown shapes, we apply the same technique to lower first premolar morphology. Our results show a clear distinction between the morphology seen in earlier hominin taxa such as Australopithecus and African early Homo, as well as Asian H. erectus, and more recent groups such as European H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens. The morphology of the earlier hominins includes an asymmetrical outline, a conspicuous talonid, and an occlusal polygon that tends to be large. The morphology of the recent hominins includes a symmetrical outline and a reduced or absent talonid. Within this later group, premolars belonging to H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis tend to possess a small and mesiolingually-displaced occlusal polygon, whereas H. sapiens specimens usually present expanded and centered occlusal polygons in an almost circular outline. The morphological differences among Paranthropus, Australopithecus, and African early Homo as studied here are small and evolutionarily less significant compared to the differences between the earlier and later homin taxa. In contrast to the lower second premolar and the upper first molar crown, the inclusion of a larger hominin sample of lower first premolars reveals a large allometric component. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously, P4 shape was assessed qualitatively, and results suggested marked differences between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans (Bailey [2002] New Anat. 269:148-156). The goal of this study was to investigate the P4 shape in more detail, quantifying it in order to determine its utility for taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analysis. A comparison of mean shapes confirms that the mesiolingual portion of the P4 is truncated in Neandertals, and that this produces a distinctively asymmetrical P4. A randomization test confirms that the shape difference between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans is significant. Principal component and discriminant function analyses indicate that the relative size of the lingual portion of the tooth also affects tooth shape, with the lingual portion of the Neandertal P4 being narrower than that of anatomically modern humans. Classification of P4 crown shapes using discriminant functions analysis is far from perfect. While 86.4% of the teeth were correctly classified, classification was much better for anatomically modern humans (98.1%) than it was for Neandertals (65%). Fortunately, crown shape is but one of several diagnostic characters of the P4 crown. P4 crown asymmetry can be added to the growing list of dental morphological characters distinguishing Neandertals from anatomically modern humans. Moreover, based on a comparison of mean tooth shapes in fossil and recent humans, symmetry, rather than asymmetry, appears to be the primitive state, and the high frequency of P4 asymmetry is likely derived in Neandertals. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Elliptic Fourier analysis; Morphometrics; Postcanine dental morphology","anatomical variation; article; controlled study; fossil; Fourier analysis; geological time; human; human tissue; mandible; neandertal; phylogeny; physical anthropology; species comparison; species difference; taxonomy; tooth crown; tooth size; Animals; Discriminant Analysis; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Mandible; Molar; Paleodontology; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Tooth Crown",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-13544271764

The sites are located in long and stratigraphically well-documented sections, ranging from the Early to the Middle Pleistocene. They yielded an impressive amount of fossils but also of lithic industries, which provide an insight into Man's earliest records and activities in Western Europe (cannibalism, earliest burial, food processing). The stratigraphic distribution of the Atapuerca mammals reveals 6 different local faunal assemblages, which are here designated the Atapuerca faunal units (ATA FU), defined by the co-occurrence of particular mammalian taxa. Moreover, the Sierra de Atapuerca sites are well known for their Early to Middle Pleistocene hominid-bearing localities. Level 6 of the Gran Dolina site has yielded the oldest fossil hominid in Western Europe, Homo antecessor, dated palaeomagnetically, radiometrically as well as biostratigraphically to around 800 ka B.P. This level TD6 characterizes the ATA FU 4. The Sierra de Atapuerca also yields the best collection of Middle Pleistocene fossil hommid remains, designated Homo heidelbergensis, from Sima de los Huesos and Trinchera Galeria. The Sima de Ins Huesos has an age of 530 ka B.P. SH and TG are referred to ATA FU 6. Numerous fossils from other Atapuerca sites are excellently preserved. Large carnivores and herbivores, small mammals, as well as birds, lizards, fishes, and frogs are found in almost every level. To date, a total of 103 taxa belonging to 9 orders, 27 families and 61 genera are recorded from the Atapuerca cave localities. © E. Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung (Nägele u.

This determination, in conjunction with various other lines of dental morphological evidence, was interpreted to be supportive of an African origin for modern humans. The present investigation expands upon this work by using: 1) direct observations of fossil hominin teeth, rather than data gleaned from published sources, 2) a single morphological scoring system (the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System) with consistent trait breakpoints, and 3) data from larger and more varied modern human comparative samples. As before, a multivariate distance statistic, the mean measure of divergence, was used to assess diachronic phenetic affinities among the Plio-Pleistocene hominins and modern humans. The present study also employed principal components analysis on dental trait frequencies across samples. Both methods yielded similar results, which support the previous findings; that is, of all modern human samples, sub-Saharan Africans again exhibit the closest phenetic similarity to various African Plio-Pleistocene hominins-through their shared prevalence of morphologically complex crown and root traits. The fact that sub-Saharan Africans express these apparently plesiomorphic characters, along with additional information on their affinity to other modern populations, evident intra-population heterogeneity, and a world-wide dental cline emanating from the sub-continent, provides further evidence that is consistent with an African origin model. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A fragmentary mandible of an adolescent (VBI), preserving nearly a full set of teeth, exhibits a symphyseal tubercle and slight incurvatio mandibulae anterior on the external symphysis. Both the superior and inferior transverse tori are present on the internal aspect. A second individual (VB2) is represented by a set of ten deciduous teeth consistent with an age at death of 6-9 months. A proximal manual phalanx (VB3) displays a relatively broad head, a characteristics which is found in both Neandertals, as well as European Middle Pleistocene hominids. VB4 is a fourth metatarsal that lacks the distal epiphysis, indicating it comes from an adolescent individual, and has a relatively high robusticity index. Finally, VB5 is a fifth metatarsal of an adult. The VB1 mandible shows a combination of archaic characteristics as well as more specific Neandertal morphological traits. The VB2 deciduous teeth are very small, and both the metrics and morphology seem more consistent with a modern human classification. The postcranial elements are undiagnostic, U-Th dating has provided an age of >350 ka for the base of the sequence and a date of <73.2 ± 5 ka for level 7, near the top. Faunal analysis and radiometric dates from other nearby Mousterian sites suggests that the Valdegoba site is correlative with oxygen isotope stages 3-6 on the Iberian peninsula, and an Upper Pleistocene age for the Valdegoba hominids seems most reasonable.","Deciduous teeth; Early modern human; Hand phalanx; Mandible; Metatarsals; Neandertal; Spain; Valdegoba; Western Europe","morphology; Neanderthal; oxygen isotope; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; Castilla y Leon; Huermeces; Spain; Hominidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035150255

The Dmanisi mandible is perhaps one of the most interesting findings, as it supposedly represents one of the oldest hominids outside of Africa. Recently, different interpretations have been published about this specimen. Our comparison of the Dmanisi mandible with a large sample of mandibles and teeth has led us to a new interpretation. In our view, the Dmanisi mandible exhibits a unique combination of traits. Some of its features, taken in isolation, may be attributed to morphological extremes within the genus Homo. The architecture of the mandible as well as the morphology and dimensions of incisors, canines, and P3s are clearly primitive. However, dental traits such as the reduction of the talonid in the P4s and a distally decreasing molar series seems to be derived. Some combinations of these traits are found in specimens of Homo ergaster and differ from those generally present in later hominids. Thus, we propose that the Dmanisi mandible might be taxonomically classified as Homo sp. indet. (aft. ergaster). Furthermore, some aspects of the dentition in Dmanisi display close similarities to Asian Homo erectus. If the 1.8-1.6 Myr dating for the Dmanisi mandible is correct, the differentiation of the Asian branch of the genus Homo could be regarded as a very ancient event.","Dentition; Dmanisi; H. ergaster; Homo; Mandible","article; bone development; dentition; evolution; hominid; mandible; physical anthropology; taxonomy; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Classification; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Mandible; Phylogeny",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031654616

Recently discovered fossils of H. erectus are allowing new insights into aspects of its evolution, such as the timing and mode of the species' emergence in Africa and its relationship to Asian populations. However, the currently available African record predating 1.0 Ma is poor, consisting of the Turkana basin, Olduvai and the more limited South African materials. Here, we describe and compare eight craniodental fossils of ∼1.4 Ma recovered from Konso, Ethiopia, that we attribute to H. erectus. These include KGA10-1, one of the better-preserved H. erectus mandibular specimens known from eastern Africa, and other fragmentary dental and cranial remains. The Konso H. erectus fossils show a mosaic of primitive and derived features. These include a large and thick mandibular corpus, a moderately developed lateral prominence, a reduced premolar morphology, and a tendency for smaller relative sizes of the posterior molars compared with earlier Homo. In some dentognathic details, such as the lack of a buccolingually narrow M1 and the presence of double mental foramina, the Konso fossils differ from eastern African H. erectus of ≥1.5 Ma. The fragmentary cranial remains exhibit weak angular and occipital tori, and an apparently weak occipital flexion, as with the eastern African H. erectus examples known from ∼1.65 to 1.2 Ma. The available evidence is consistent with the interpretation that African early H. erectus shows morphological continuity within the ∼1.65 to 1.0 Ma time period, with relatively little morphological evolution prior to 1.4 Ma and advanced dentognathic gracility occurring sometime thereafter. The Konso evidence corroborates the hypothesis that the African H. erectus populations represent a variable but continuous evolutionary succession that was a likely source of multiple events of gene flow to the Eurasian continent. © 2007 The Anthropological Society of Nippon.","Early Pleistocene; Ethiopia; Hominid evolution; Homo erectus; Konso",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548434845

This is a cave deposit more than 21 m thick of sedimentary sequence that has been divided into 21 litostratigraphic units, grouped in three sedimentary phases, with well-distinguished texture, colour and composition. The 'Sima del Elefante' has offered a variety of paleontological record, with a particular richness in fossil birds, rodents and carnivores. Paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic data allow dating the lower levels of the site (E-8 to E-14) as Lower Pleistocene. On the other hand, the middle and upper levels of the sequence (E-15 to E-19) seem to correspond to the end of the Middle Pleistocene in the light of the macro-vertebrates remains and the presence of several archaeological levels with a lithic industry of musterian features. During the 2000 field season, a flake on flint of anthropic manufacture was discovered at E-11 level. This finding, together with other evidences recovered in previous seasons, represent the oldest evidence of human occupation at the Sierra de Atapuerca, and confirms the presence of humans in Europe at least one million years ago. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.","Atapuerca; Cave infilling; Europe; Human occupation; Lower Pleistocene",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18044404448

It is thus of great importance for the understanding of early humans outside of Africa, especially because it, together with the remains from the nearby Ubeidiya site in Israel, is one of the few early finds from this region. The aim of the present study was to assess Dmanisi's affinities by comparing its major descriptive and metrical characteristics with those of a wide range of Homo fossils dated from ca. 1-9 to 0'25 Ma B.P. Original fossils from Africa and Asia, as well as a cast collection of the Zhoukoudian specimens, were used in this comparison. The analyses focus on features of the mandibular body and dimensions of the teeth. The metrical variables were also analysed with multivariate statistics. As the results show, many features and analyses reveal great overlap between early Homo/Homo habilis and chronologically defined subgroups of Homo erectus. Nevertheless, Dmanisi exhibits clear affinities to the H. erectus range. Despite its early date, this hominid possesses a number of progressive features (e.g. in the chin region, symphyseal cross-section, and teeth dimensions) which otherwise are more likely to occur in considerably later H. erectus specimens. © 1996 Academic Press Limited.","Dmanisi; Early Pleistocene; Homo erectus; Mandible","Hominidae; Homo erectus; Homo habilis; Homo erectus; mandible; Pleistocene; Georgia, Dmanisi",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030470499

The role of climate change in the last phase (900-700 ka) of the Middle Pleistocene Transition (MPT) in the Levant and northeast Africa was examined, using marine and non-marine records. During the MPT the global climate system shifted from a linear 41 k.yr. into a highly non-linear 100 k.yr. system, considerably changing its global modulation. Northeast Africa aridity further intensified around 950. ka, as indicated by a sharp increase in dust flux, and a jump to overall higher levels thereafter, coinciding with a lack of sapropels in the deep eastern Mediterranean (930-690. ka). The increased dust flux centering at ∼800. ka corresponds to the minima in 400 k.yr. eccentricity, a minima in 65 °N solar forcing and in the weakest African monsoon precession periodicity. This resulted in expansion of hyper-arid conditions across North Africa, the lowest lake levels in eastern Africa and the lowest rainfall in the Nile River headwaters. In the eastern Mediterranean an increasing continental signature is seen in glacial stages 22 (∼880. ka) and 20 (∼800. ka). Lower arboreal pollen values also indicate arid conditions during these glacial stages. The southern and eastern parts of the Negev Desert, unlike its northern part, were hyper-arid during the MPT, making them highly unsustainable. The fluctuations in the stands of Lake Amora follow global climate variability but were more moderate than those of its last glacial Lake Lisan successor. In the northern Jordan-Valley Hula Lake, frequent fluctuations in lake level coincide with both global climate changes and minor changes in water salinity varying from fresh to oligohaline. It appears therefore that the most pronounced and widespread deterioration in climate occurred in northeast Africa from 900 to 700. ka, whereas in the Levant the corresponding climatic changes were more moderate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Early/middle Pleistocene transition; Levant; Paleoclimate","glaciation; hominid; human evolution; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; Levant; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952354610

However, analyses of large mammal turnover at this time in Africa have been lacking, largely because of the low number of sites dated to this interval. Recent work, particularly in the last 10 years, has resulted in a much larger published sample of sites and we synthesize these data in this paper. In our multivariate (TWINSPAN) analyses of African and Levantine large mammal faunas we found that localities were subdivided by geographic regions, not by age. There were some small-scale changes with the appearance or extinction of particular taxa, but there was no large-scale turnover such as that seen in Europe. The Levant was included as a possible route for faunal interchange with east Africa, but no similarities were found between these areas. It therefore appears that the modern zoogeographic separation of the Levant and north Africa into the Palaearctic region and sub-Saharan Africa into the African region can be traced back to at least the Early-Middle Pleistocene boundary. © The Geological Society of London 2005.",,"mammal; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; Africa; Levant; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-31344459333

However, distinctive African traits, such as corpus robustness and strong alveolar prominence, are absent in the Gran Dolina specimen. At the same time, none of the apomorphic features that characterize Middle and early Upper Pleistocene European hominids can be recognized in ATD6-5. Finally, the Gran Dolina specimen displays a remarkable position of the mylohyoid groove, only comparable to that found in immature specimens of Homo ergaster, and very rarely in adult H. sapiens. The morphology of ATD6-5 supports the hypothesis of an African origin for the first Europeans with subsequent phylogenetic continuity with Middle Pleistocene populations in Europe. These findings are consistent with H. antecessor being the last common ancestor of Neandertals and H. sapiens.

They include the left side of the body and the symphyseal region of an adult mandible that contains three molar teeth (KNM‐ER 730), an edentulous left‐sided mandibular fragment (KNM‐ER 731) and the shaft of a left femur (KNM‐ER 737). The specimens are described in anatomical detail, illustrated and selected measurements given. It is concluded that they should be attributed to the genus Homo sp. indet. Detailed comparative studies will be published in due course.
