Most regression, correlation, and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of these phenomena are given, and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny is proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies. -from Author",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022203256

As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

This change followed in large part from the realization that traditional methods of statistical analysis tacitly assumed independence of all observations, when in fact biological groups such as species are differentially related to each other according to their evolutionary history. New phylogenetically based analytical methods were then rapidly developed, incorporated into 'the comparative method', and applied to many physiological, biochemical, morphological and behavioral investigations. We now review the rationale for including phylogenetic information in comparative studies and briefly discuss three methods for doing this (independent contrasts, generalized least-squares models, and Monte Carlo computer simulations). We discuss when and how to use phylogenetic information in comparative studies and provide several examples in which it has been helpful, or even crucial, to a comparative analysis. We also consider some difficulties with phylogenetically based statistical methods, and of comparative approaches in general, both practical and theoretical. It is our personal opinion that the incorporation of phylogeny information into comparative studies has been highly beneficial, not only because it can improve the reliability of statistical inferences, but also because it continually emphasizes the potential importance of past evolutionary history in determining current form and function.","Allometry; Comparative method; Evolutionary physiology; Model of evolution; Phylogeny; Statistical analysis","computer simulation; methodology; Monte Carlo method; phylogeny; physiology; review; statistical model; statistics; Computer Simulation; Models, Statistical; Monte Carlo Method; Phylogeny; Physiology, Comparative; Statistics",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-24644494898

The phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), phylogenetic generalized least-squares (PGLS), and phylogenetic autocorrelation (PA) methods are compared. Although the independent contrasts are not orthogonal, they are independent if the data conform to the Brownian motion model of evolution on which they are based. It is shown that uncentered correlations and regressions through the origin using the PIC method are identical to those obtained using PGLS with an intercept included in the model. The PIC method is a special case of PGLS. Corrected standard errors are given for estimates of the ancestral states based on the PGLS approach. The treatment of trees with hard polytomies is discussed and is shown to be an algorithmic rather than a statistical problem. Some of the relationships among the methods are shown graphically using the multivariate space in which variables are represented as vectors with respect to OTUs used as coordinate axes. The maximum-likelihood estimate of the autoregressive parameter, ρ, has not been computed correctly in previous studies (an appendix with MATLAB code provides a corrected algorithm). The importance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connection matrix, W, for the distribution of ρ is discussed. The PA method is shown to have several problems that limit its usefulness in comparative studies. Although the PA method is a generalized least-squares procedure, it cannot be made equivalent to the PGLS method using a phylogenetic model.","Autoregressive models; Comparative method; Generalized least-squares; Independent contrasts; Maximum likelihood; Phylogenetic autocorrelation; Phylogeny; Regression","evolution; methodology; phylogenetics; statistical analysis; Otus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035685482

Reference groups constituted of prehistoric dogs, and recent wolves and dogs. The fossil large canid from Goyet (Belgium), dated at c. 31,700 BP is clearly different from the recent wolves, resembling most closely the prehistoric dogs. Thus it is identified as a Palaeolithic dog, suggesting that dog domestication had already started during the Aurignacian. The Epigravettian Mezin 5490 (Ukraine) and Mezhirich (Ukraine) skulls are also identified as being Palaeolithic dogs. Selected Belgian specimens were analyzed for mtDNA and stable isotopes. All fossil samples yielded unique DNA sequences, indicating that the ancient Belgian large canids carried a substantial amount of genetic diversity. Furthermore, there is little evidence for phylogeographic structure in the Pleistocene large canids, as they do not form a homogenous genetic group. Although considerable variation occurs in the fossil canid isotope signatures between sites, the Belgian fossil large canids preyed in general on horse and large bovids. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The precise origins and dispersal routes of the Austronesian peoples and the associated Lapita culture remain contentious, and numerous disparate models of dispersal (based primarily on linguistic, genetic, and archeological data) have been proposed. Here, through the use of mtDNA from 781 modern and ancient Sus specimens, we provide evidence for an early human-mediated translocation of the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) to Flores and Timor and two later separate human-mediated dispersals of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) through Island Southeast Asia into Oceania. Of the later dispersal routes, one is unequivocally associated with the Neolithic (Lapita) and later Polynesian migrations and links modern and archeological Javan, Sumatran, Wallacean, and Oceanic pigs with mainland Southeast Asian S. scrofa. Archeological and genetic evidence shows these pigs were certainly introduced to islands east of the Wallace Line, including New Guinea, and that so-called ""wild"" pigs within this region are most likely feral descendants of domestic pigs introduced by early agriculturalists. The other later pig dispersal links mainland East Asian pigs to western Micronesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines. These results provide important data with which to test current models for human dispersal in the region. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Domestication; mtDNA; Pacific colonization; Phylogeography","mitochondrial DNA; animal tissue; article; DNA determination; domestic pig; geological time; migration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Pacific islands; paleoanthropology; paleoenvironment; phylogeography; population movement pattern; priority journal; Southeast Asia; swine; unindexed sequence; animal; Bayes theorem; genetics; geography; haplotype; history; molecular genetics; phylogeny; population migration; principal component analysis; swine; Gabaza; Suidae; Sus; Sus celebensis; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica; Animal Migration; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; Bayes Theorem; DNA, Mitochondrial; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceania; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Swine",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247626810

These have been used to reconstruct the general paleoecological setting of the sites as well as provide more specific inferences on hominid habitat use. Previous paleoecological studies utilizing the Olduvai fauna have been taxon-based, substituting the habitat preferences of modern taxa for those of their extinct relatives. Here we investigate the relationship between bovid metapodial functional anatomy and habitat preference using taxon-free discriminant function analyses. We develop discriminant function models linking metapodial morphology to three broadly-defined habitat categories (open, intermediate, closed) using modern bovids of known ecology. The models developed for complete, proximal and distal metapodials are then applied to metapodials from four Bed I archeological localities: DK I, FLK NN I, FLK I and FLK N I. Results support the presence of the drying trend previously noted from middle to upper Bed I. They contradict taxon-based studies of the Olduvai bovids, suggesting a higher proportion of intermediate and closed habitats. The results of this study do not support theories of hominid foraging based on the exploitation of a single habitat type. The bovids from each locality exhibit a range of morphologies, suggesting that hominids at Olduvai were utilizing habitats ranging from open to closed, perhaps the full range available in the lake margin zone. © 1994 Academic Press.

It aims to establish the extent to which the distinctive features of adult representatives of these populations are present in the early post natal period and to what extent population differences in ontogenetic scaling and allometric trajectories contribute to distinct facial forms. The analyses utilize configurations of facial landmarks and are carried out using geometric morphometric methods. The results of this study show that modern human populations can be distinguished based on facial shape alone, irrespective of age or sex, indicating the early presence of differences. Additionally, some populations have statistically distinct facial ontogenetic trajectories that lead to the development of further differences later in ontogeny. We conclude that population-specific facial morphologies develop principally through distinctions in facial shape probably already present at birth and further accentuated and modified to variable degrees during growth. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the plasticity of facial growth patterns in modern humans. Further, they have important implications in relation to the study of growth in the face of fossil hominins and in relation to the possibility of developing effective discriminant functions for the identification of population affinities of immature facial skeletal material. Such tools would be of value in archaeological, forensic and anthropological applications. The findings of this study underline the need to examine more deeply, and in more detail, the ontogenetic basis of other causes of craniometric variation, such as sexual dimorphism and hominin species differentiation.","Allometric vectors; Craniofacial variation; Facial ontogeny","adolescent; adult; allometry; anthropology; archeology; article; controlled study; craniofacial development; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; face; face growth; facial bone; female; forensic medicine; fossil; geometry; human; human experiment; male; normal human; perinatal period; plasticity; population differentiation; population research; priority journal; sex difference; species differentiation; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Continental Population Groups; Facial Bones; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maxillofacial Development; Morphogenesis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036737886

Habitat reconstructions typically rely upon various biological or physical habitat indicators, and here we present reconstructions of the Plio-Pleistocene paleohabitats of Koobi Fora and Olduvai Gorge as based on fossil bovids (Artiodactyla: Bovidae). Bovids are the most common faunal element at most Neogene hominid and hominoid fossil localities and have been widely studied. This study addresses the funtional morphology of the bovid femur through discriminant function analysis and provides additional support for the observation that certain features of the femur demonstrate clear correlations with the amount of vegetative cover in different modern habitats. The reconstructions for both Koobi Fora and Olduvai Gorge suggest that the full range of environments inhabited by living bovids was present during the Plio-Pleistocene. Koobi Fora appears to have had a somewhat higher percentage of more closed habitats than the relatively more open habitats of Olduvai Gorge. These habitat reconstructions are in broad agreement with other reconstructions based on a purely taxonomic approach to the bovid remains. Grounding our reconstructions of paleoenvironments in studies of functional morphology can help to develop a richer idea of the habitats and resources available to early hominids. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Bovids; Hominids; Koobi fora; Olduvai; Plio-pleistocene","Artiodactyla; Bovidae; Hominidae; Hominoidea; Animalia; Artiodactyla; Bovidae; Hominidae; Hominoidea; Mammalia; bovid; fossil mammal; hominid; palaeoenvironment; Pleistocene; Pliocene; vegetation cover; Africa; animal; article; bovids; discriminant analysis; environment; evolution; Africa, Eastern; Animals; Discriminant Analysis; Environment; Evolution; Ruminants; Kenya, Koobi Fora; Tanzania, Olduvai Gorge",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031064119

However, form provides the basis for the description of organisms, and the study of fossils crucially depends on morphology. Complex organisms tend to evolve as 'mosaics', in which parts may be modified at varying rates and in response to different selective pressures. Thus, individual anatomical regions may contain different phylogenetic signals. In the present study, we used computerized methods to 'dissect' the skulls of a primate clade, the guenons, into functional and developmental modules (FDM). The potential of different modules as proxies for phylogenetic divergence in modern lineages was investigated. We found that the chondrocranium was the only FDM in which shape consistently had a strong and significant phylogenetic signal. This region might be less susceptible to epigenetic factors and thus more informative about phylogeny. The examination of the topology of trees from the chondrocranium suggested that the main differences evolved at the time of the radiation of terrestrial and arboreal guenons. However, phylogenetic reconstructions were found to be strongly affected by sampling error, with more localized anatomical regions (i.e. smaller/less complex FDMs) generally producing less reproducible tree topologies. This finding, if confirmed in other groups, implies that the utility of specific FDMs for phylogenetic inference could, in many cases, be hampered by the low reproducibility of results. The study also suggested that uncertainties due to sampling error may be larger than those from character sampling. This might have implications for phylogenetic analyses, which typically provide estimates of support of tree nodes based on characters but do not generally take into account the effect of sampling error on the tree topology. Nonetheless, studies of the potential of different FDMs as proxies for phylogenetic divergence in modern lineages, such as the present study, provide a framework that may help in modelling the morphological evolution of present and fossil species. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.","Cercopithecini; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological evolution; Reliability and reproducibility; Skull modules","cranium; divergence; evolution; fossil; morphology; morphometry; phylogenetics; primate; signal; skull; species complex; topology; Animalia; Cercopithecini; Primates",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-40749104643

This methodological paper examines approaches to optimizing the classification of specimens based on their outlines. This study examines the performance of four approaches to the mathematical representation of outlines and two different approaches to curve measurement as applied to a collection of feather outlines. A new approach to the dimension reduction necessary to carry out a CVA on this type of outline data with modest sample sizes is also presented, and its performance is compared to two other approaches to dimension reduction. Results: Two semi-landmark-based methods, bending energy alignment and perpendicular projection, are shown to produce roughly equal rates of classification, as do elliptical Fourier methods and the extended eigenshape method of outline measurement. Rates of classification were not highly dependent on the number of points used to represent a curve or the manner in which those points were acquired. The new approach to dimensionality reduction, which utilizes a variable number of principal component (PC) axes, produced higher cross-validation assignment rates than either the standard approach of using a fixed number of PC axes or a partial least squares method. Conclusion: Classification of specimens based on feather shape was not highly dependent of the details of the method used to capture shape information. The choice of dimensionality reduction approach was more of a factor, and the cross validation rate of assignment may be optimized using the variable number of PC axes method presented herein. © 2006 Sheets et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749530871

For the most part, this stems from the difficulty of reconstructing ancient hominin habitats. Bovids are among the most frequently utilized paleoenvironmental indicators, but little is known about the habitat preferences of extinct taxa. It is generally assumed that fossil bovids both ate the same things and occupied the same habitats as their closest extant relatives. We test the first part of this assumption by reconstructing the diets of seven bovids from Makapansgat Limeworks, South Africa. Since diet and habitat are linked, these reconstructions have implications for our understanding of fossil bovid habitat tolerances. Ecomorphological and stable carbon isotope analyses are employed, allowing us to take advantage of the strengths and overcome the weaknesses of both. In most cases, fossil bovids did have similar diets to their extant relatives, and probably occupied similar habitats.

However, investigators using DFA must account for (1) the possibility of correct classification due to chance alone, and (2) the influence of prior probabilities of group membership on classification results. A search of the recent otolith chemistry literature showed that these two concerns are sometimes ignored, so we used simulated data sets to explore the potential pitfalls of such oversights. We found that when estimating reclassification success for a training data set, small sample sizes or unbalanced sampling designs can produce remarkably high reclassification success rates by chance alone, especially when prior probabilities are estimated from sample size. When using a training data set to classify unknown individuals, maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions and group membership afforded up to 20% improvement over DFA with uninformative priors when groups contributed to the sample unequally. Given these results, we recommend the use of (1) randomization tests to estimate the probability that reclassification success is better than random, and (2) maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions in place of uninformative priors. © Inter-Research 2007.","Classification; Discriminant function analysis; Jackknife reclassification success; Null hypothesis; Otolith chemistry; Prior probabilities; Randomization test","classification; data set; discriminant analysis; marine ecosystem; maximum likelihood analysis; otolith; probability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846990136

Such techniques have some advantages over taxon-based methods of inferring paleoenvironments (e.g. they do not assume stasis in a lineage's habitat preference over evolutionary time). Current methods for predicting habitat preference from bovid postcrania are restricted to femora and metapodials, whose preservation is often limited. We describe here a method for predicting paleohabitats using measurements of bovid astragali. The astragalus method correctly predicted the habitat preference for 146 of 218 modern bovid specimens (67%, 2.7 times better than chance; p<0.0001). This accuracy compares well with that of femur and metapodial methods (1.8-3.4 times better than chance). In addition, analysis of the probabilities associated with the habitat predictions allows a confidence threshold to be established that identifies specific predictions which have <5% chance of being in error. This raises the effective accuracy of the method to 95%. Extensive exploration and manipulation of the underlying data demonstrate that the habitat predictions are generally robust, and are relatively independent of body weight, taxonomy, and sample composition. The accuracy of this method and its broad applicability make it a useful addition to the existing array of techniques for inferring past environments. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Bovids are the most abundant mammals at Fort Ternan. Understanding their habitat preferences provides a basis for reconstructing the paleoenvironment. I present here a study of the morphology of the bovid hind limb that demonstrates a functional linkage between several femoral characters and habitat type as these features relate to locomotion. The majority of bovids living today in savannas are highly cursorial. These species possess a laterally expanded femoral head that limits hind limb movements to the parasagittal plane, and an elliptically shaped patellar groove that provides a large moment arm for the muscles of extension. Forest bovids have a more spherically shaped femoral head that facilitates a high degree of hip abduction and axial rotation. This morphology aids locomotion across the complexly structured substrate of the forest floor. Bovids from broken cover or woodland habitats display intermediate morphologies. A discriminant function analysis that uses the femoral characters to predict habitat type demonstrates a statistically significant separation among a large sample of extant bovids from forest, woodland, and savanna. This study provides a sound basis for interpreting the locomotor adaptations of fossil bovids. The bovids from Fort Ternan display a set of intermediate morphologies most similar to those of extant woodland bovids. The Chinji Formation of Pakistan contains the middle Miocene hominoidSivapithecus and a parallel analysis of the fossil bovids from these sediments shows that they are most similar to extant forest bovids. This contrast in paleoenvironments suggests thatKenyapithecus andSivapithecus may have lived in different paleoecological settings. Establishing the relationship between the dietary and locomotor adaptations of these two species and the specific nature of their paleoenvironments has important implications for understanding the course of later hominoid evolution. © 1991 Academic Press Limited.","bovids; functional morphology; hominoid evolution; Kenyapithecus; middle Miocene; paleoecology","bovid; habitat; hominoid; Kenyapithecus; palaeoenvironment; Kenya, Nyanza, Fort Ternan; Bovidae; Hominoidea; Kenyapithecus; Kenyapithecus wickeri; Mammalia; Sivapithecus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026064849

A global sample of extant bovids (n = 205), cervids (n = 14), and tragulids (n = 5) from seven known habitat types constitutes the comparative data set. All long bones, carpals, tarsals, and phalanges were measured. Discriminant function analyses (DFA) were conducted in order to evaluate the ability of each element to accurately predict habitat affiliation. The baseline of chance accuracy for DFAs (i.e., the percentage of correct predictions that can be expected when habitat assignments are randomized) served as the cut-off point between good and bad habitat predictors. A total of 22 elements yielded percentages of correct classification over the baseline of accuracy, and these were extended to the Laetoli fossil assemblages. Summaries of the number of specimens predicted to belong to each habitat type were used to reconstruct the paleoenvironment. The results indicate that, at the time of the deposition of the Laetolil Beds, the area had heavy woodland-bushland cover with some lighter tree and bush cover and grass available. These results lend strong support to recent suggestions that the area was on the more wooded end of the habitat spectrum, contra initial conclusions that it represented a mosaic of more open habitats. The results also indicate that, during the deposition of the Ndolanya Beds, the environment had become more open and the grassland component of the environment had increased significantly. Light woodland-bushland and an abundance of grass cover dominated the landscape, although tracts of land with denser vegetation likely existed. This conclusion agrees with earlier suggestions that the area was a semiarid bushland. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of geometric morphometrics allows us 1) to define size and shape variations as independent factors (an essential but seldom respected condition for heterochrony), and 2) to calculate in percentage of shape changes and to graphically represent the parts of shape variation which are related to various biological phenomena: common allometry, intraspecific allometry, and allometric and nonallometric shape discrimination. Three tridimensional Procrustes analyses and the calculation of multivariate allometries, discriminant functions, and statistical tests are used to compare the skulls of 50 Pan troglodytes, and 50 Gorilla gorilla of different dental stages. The results both complement and modify classical results obtained from similar material but with different methods (Shea [1983] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 62:275-289; Shea [1983] Folia Primatol. (Basel) 40:32-68; Shea [1985] Size and Scaling in Primate Morphology, New York: Plenum, p. 175-205). As previously described by Shea, the common growth allometric pattern is very important (64% of total shape variation). It corresponds to a larger increase of facial volume than of neurocranial volume, a more obliquely oriented foramen magnum, and a noticeable reshaping of the nuchal region (higher inion). However, the heterochronic interpretation based on common allometry is rather different from Shea. Gorillas differ from chimpanzees not only with a larger magnitude of allometric change (rate peramorphosis), as is classically said, but also grow more in size than in shape (size acceleration). In other words, for a similar stage of growth, gorillas have the size and shape corresponding to older chimpanzees, and for a similar shape, gorillas have a larger size than chimpanzees. In contrast, sexual dimorphism actually corresponds to allometric changes only, as classically demonstrated (time hypermorphosis). Sexual dimorphism is here significant in adult gorillas alone, and solely in terms of allometry (size-related shape and size, given that sagittal and nuchal crests are not taken into account). The study also permits us to differentiate two different shape variations that are classically confused in ontogenetic studies: a very small part of allometric shape change which is specific to each species (1% of the total shape variation), and nonallometric species-specific traits independent of growth (8% of total shape change). When calculated in terms of intraspecific allometries (including common allometry and noncommon allometry), shape changes are more extensive in gorillas (36% of total shape change) than in chimpanzees (29% of total shape change). The allometric differences mainly concern the inion, which becomes higher; the position of the foramen magnum, more dorsally oriented; and the palate, more tilted in adult gorillas than in adult chimpanzees. In contrast, nonallometric species-specific traits in gorillas are the long and flat vault characterized by a prominent occipital region, the higher and displaced backward glabella, and the protrusive nose. Biomechanical schemes built from shape partition suggest that the increased out-of-plumb position of the head during growth is partially compensated in gorillas by a powerful nuchal musculature due to the peculiar shape of the occipital region. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Allometry; Gorilla gorilla; Heterochrony; Pan troglodytes; Procrustes; Sexual dimorphism; Skull","Africa; allometry; ape; article; calculation; chimpanzee; female; gorilla; male; morphometrics; nonhuman; ontogeny; Pan troglodytes; physical anthropology; sex difference; skull; species differentiation; statistical model; Africa; Animals; Biometry; Female; Gorilla gorilla; Male; Models, Biological; Models, Theoretical; Pan troglodytes; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-2642523749

In this paper I review the basic procedures used for discriminating groups of organisms based on morphological characteristics – measures of size and shape. A critical reading of morphometric discrimination studies of various kinds of organisms in recent years suggests that a review of procedures is warranted, particularly with regard to the kinds of assumptions being made.

Some common pitfalls of these methods when used to analyze fossil specimens are: (1) ignoring the possibility that a fossil belongs to a group other than one of the predefined reference samples (i.e., restricted versus unrestricted approaches to classification), (2) misinterpreting probabilities of group membership (i.e., posterior versus typicality probabilities), and (3) failing to understand how sample sizes influence multivariate ordinations in trying to effectively illustrate the morphometric affinities of a fossil (i.e., weighted versus unweighted analyses with fossils entered indirectly or directly into the analysis). To better understand canonincal variate analysis and generalized distances, the workings of these methods are portrayed graphically as a series of rotations and rescaling of data plotted in a multivariate data space. The influence of sample sizes and the importance of higher-numberer canonical variates are emphasized.

This approach is typically considered an ""ecomorphological"" method, and has frequently been applied to bovid postcranial remains. Methods for predicting habitat preference from bovid postcrania currently exist for femora, metapodials, and astragali. Here we describe three methods for predicting paleohabitats using measurements of African bovid phalanges (proximal, intermediate, and distal). The proximal phalanx method correctly predicted the habitat preference for 130 of 183 modern bovid specimens (71.0%, 2.8 times better than chance, p < 0.0001). The intermediate phalanx method correctly predicted the habitat preference for 115 of 163 modern bovid specimens (70.6%, 2.8 times better than chance, p < 0.0001). The distal phalanx method correctly predicted the habitat preference for 87 of 122 modern bovid specimens (71.3%, 2.8 times better than chance, p < 0.0001). These accuracies compare well with those of existing such methods (1.8-3.4 times better than chance). Analysis of the probabilities associated with the habitat predictions allows confidence thresholds to be established that identify specific predictions which have <5% chance of being in error. This raises the effective accuracy of the methods to 95%. Extensive exploration and manipulation of the underlying data demonstrate that the habitat predictions are generally robust, and are relatively independent of body weight, taxonomy, and sample composition. These methods are broadly applicable, relatively accurate, and can be used to generate independent predictions of habitat from different elements, and thus constitute a useful approach to inferring past environments. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

They have varied ecologies, include arboreal and terrestrial species, and can be found in nearly every region of sub-Saharan Africa. Species boundaries are often uncertain, with a variable number of species and subspecies mostly recognised on the basis of their geographic distribution and pelage. If guenon soft tissue patterns show high variability, the same does not seem to hold for skull morphology. Guenon skulls are traditionally considered relatively undifferentiated and homogeneous. However, patterns of variation in skulls have never been examined using a large number of specimens sampled across the breadth of species diversity. Thus, in the present study, skulls of adult guenons and two outgroup species are analysed using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics. Three-dimensional coordinates of 86 anatomical landmarks were measured on 1,315 adult specimens belonging to all living guenon species except Cercopithecus dryas. Species are well-discriminated using shape but the best discrimination occurs when species have either a long evolutionary history (e.g., Allenopithecus nigroviridis) or represent extremes of size variation (Miopithecus sp. and Erythrocebus patas). Interspecific phenetic relationships reflect size differences. Four main clusters are found that mainly correspond to four size groups: the smallest species (Miopithecus sp.), the largest species (E. patas plus the study outgroups), a group of medium-small arboreal guenons, and a group of medium-large arboreal and terrestrial guenons. Correlations between interspecific shape distances and interspecific differences in size are higher than between shape distances and genetic distances. However, if only the component of interspecific shape variation which is not correlated to evolutionary allometry is used in the comparison with genetic distances, correlations are up to 1.4 times larger than those including allometric shape. The smallest correlations are those between shape and ecological distances, which is consistent with the lack of clusters clearly reflecting broad ecological specialisations (e.g., arboreality versus terrestriality). Thus, size, which is generally considered more evolutionarily labile than shape, seems to have played a major role in the evolution of the guenons. The incongruence between interspecific shape differences and phylogeny might be explained by a large proportion of shape changes having occurred along allometric trajectories that tend to be conserved within this clade. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Interpretation of these soil signatures, however, has generally been more problematic. One approach to the problem has been the use of ethnographic or ""known"" sites to guide interpretation, but how confidently can results from one site be extrapolated to another? This study of abandoned farms tests the site specificity of soil multi-element signatures of past space use through the use of discriminant models. Data analysis suggests that one to one comparisons of similar sites are much less accurate (38% accuracy) than comparisons based on a wider range of sites (59.3% accuracy), even when the latter have contrasting geology.

Consequently, this postcranial material cannot be confidently assigned to a particular taxon, with the result that little is known about the locomotor strategies and habitat preferences of specific Plio-Pleistocene cercopithecoids from southern Africa. However, cercopithecoid postcrania can provide important information about habitats that were present at fossil sites, even when the material is not attributed to taxa. In this paper, ecomorphic analysis is used to assign cercopithecoid postcranial material from Sterkfontein Member 4, Bolt's Farm and Swartkrans Members 1 and 2 to one of three habitat/locomotor categories: forest-living arboreal quadrupeds ('forest arboreal'), open habitat terrestrial quadrupeds ('open terrestrial') and open habitat cercopithecoids using a mix of arboreal and terrestrial quadrupedalism ('open mixed'). Cercopithecoids representing all three habitat categories were found in the samples from Sterkfontein Member 4 and Bolt's Farm, suggesting that monkeys using a range of habitats and locomotor strategies were present at these sites. However, no 'forest arboreal' cercopithecoids were found in the samples from Swartkrans Members 1 and 2, indicating that cercopithecoids at these localities probably depended largely on open habitats. The habitat and locomotor strategy data were also used in combination with locality-based listings of fossil cercopithecoid craniodental remains to suggest possible locomotor strategies for several southern African Plio-Pleistocene cercopithecoid taxa, including Parapapio broomi (possibly 'forest arboreal'), Parapapio jonesi ('open terrestrial'), Papio robinsoni ('open terrestrial') and Cercopithecoides williamsi('open mixed').","Cercopithecoidea; Ecomorphology; Plio-Pleistocene; Postcranial","ecomorphology; morphology; paleoecology; Pleistocene; Pliocene; primate; Gauteng; South Africa; Cercopithecoidea; Cercopithecoidea; Mammalia; Mammalia; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Primates; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035719288

Such inferences are useful in deciphering aspects of paleocommunity structure and predator-prey relationships. Specifically, the hypsodonty index combined with δ13C values allows classifying the ungulates among grazers from open habitat (Equus altidens, Bison sp., Praeovibos sp., Hemitragus albus, Hippopotamus antiquus, and Mammuthus meridionalis), mixed feeders (Soergelia minor and Pseudodama sp.), and browsers from canopy areas (Stephanorhinus sp. and Praemegaceros cf. verticornis). Given that δ13C values indicate that all these herbivores fed exclusively on C3, plants, significant differences in isotopic values between perissodactyls (monogastric, hindgut fermenters) and ruminants (foregut fermenters) reflect differences in digestive efficiency. Values of δ18O indicate the dietary water source of ungulates, revealing that Pseudodama sp., Hemitragus albus, and Soergelia minor obtained a significant fraction of their metabolic water from vegetation. Carnivores show higher δ15N values than herbivores, which records the isotopic enrichment expected with an increase in trophic level. Hippopotamus antiquus and Praeovibos sp. have unexpectedly high δ15N values, suggesting that they predominantly consumed aquatic plants and lichens, respectively. Inferences on predator-prey relationships, derived from the use of linear mixing models, indicate resource partitioning among sympatric predators; saber-tooth Megantereon whitei and jaguar Panthera cf. gombaszoegensis were ambushers in dosed habitat while saber-tooth Homotherium latidens and wild dog Lycaon lycaonoides were coursing predators in open plains.

We based this appreciation upon the detailed morphology of the distal part of the metapodials. Landmark approaches were applied to archaeological and palaeontological samples from three distinct areas: Switzerland Plateau, Paris Basin, and Charente (France). Little differences of isometric size characterized the three regional samples. Multivariate analyses of shape (principal component analysis, discriminant, canonical variates and neural network analyses) revealed similar sets of complex shape features on both metacarpals and metatarsals. In addition, regional groups appeared clearly differentiated by well defined shape patterns, the functional implications of which remain to be established. These results evidence the existence of a regional structuration of populations (particularly clear on the CVA of both metacarpals and metatarsals) suggesting the absence of long distance migrations. Finally, it appears that the distinction between size and shape systematically operated by geometric morphometrics can provide better insights into the study of the mobility of ancient populations. Geometric morphometrics approaches such as 3D Procrustes superimpositions, appear therefore to be of great interest for archaeological purposes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment of optic disc morphology is essential in the diagnosis and management of many ophthalmic disorders. Much work has been performed to characterize size-related parameters of the optic disc; however, limited information is available on shape variation in the general population. In contrast to optic disc or cup sizes, which are conceptually meaningful variables with a defined unit of measurement, there are few metric constructs by which to quantify, visualize and interpret variation in optic disc or cup shape. This has significance in ophthalmic diseases with a genetic basis as recent evidence has suggested that optic disc shape may be heritable. Conventional optic disc shape measures of 'ovality' and 'form-factor' reduce a complex structure to a single number and eliminate information of potential diagnostic relevance from further analyses. The recent advent of 'geometric morphometrics', a branch of statistics that incorporates tools from geometry, biometrics and computer graphics in the quantitative analysis of biological forms, has enabled spatial relationships in shape data to be retained during analysis. The analytical methods employed in geometric morphometrics can be separated into two distinct groups: landmark-based (e.g. Procrustes analysis, thin-plate splines) and boundary outline techniques (e.g. Fourier analysis). In this review, we summarize current approaches to the study of optic disc morphology, discuss the underlying theory of geometric morphometrics within the context of analytical techniques and then explore the contemporary relevance of the subject matter to several biological fields. Finally we illustrate the potential application of geometric morphometrics to the specific problem of optic disc shape and glaucoma assessment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We use both methods here to review chemical imprints that might be useful for recognizing space use and identifying daily activities in a reconstructed Iron Age village at Lejre, Denmark. As documented in many previous studies, element analysis enabled separate activity areas to be distinguished, but the results could not be used to identify the specific activities pursued in the areas. A more qualitative identification of activity areas was possible through lipid analysis, however. The carbon chain distribution, studied for Average Chain Length (ACL), Carbon chain Diversity Index (CDI) and Carbon Preference Index (CPI), enabled a similar separation to be achieved as by element analysis, so that the same areas could be discerned in addition to the reference samples. The stable was distinguished by a substantial input of coprostanol and even more so by 24-ethylcoprostanol, indicating a faecal input from herbivores. Trace levels of these markers were also identified at the entrance, where the animals had passed through. The dwelling area, consisting of two adjacent rooms, could be identified by the sterol ratio (cholesterol/[stigmasterol + β-sitosterol + campesterol]). Lipids from an archaeological context have decayed further toward simpler compounds and become more difficult to identify. Some markers have however a better potential for survival. The results emphasize the importance of further studies on ethnoarchaeological material in order to recognize past activities by element analysis. Moreover, the combination of element and lipid analyses provided a tool that enabled all the separate areas to be identified and provided positive identification of the activities concerned in all areas except the smithy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Within species, sexual dimorphism in skull shape follows the direction of size-related shape variation of adults, is proportional to differences in size, and tends to be larger in large-bodied species. Interspecific divergence among shape trajectories, which explain within species sex differences, are small (i.e., trajectories of most species are nearly parallel). Thus, changes in relative proportions of skull regions that account for the distinctive shape of females and males are relatively conserved across species, and their magnitude largely depends on differences in size between sexes. A conservative pattern of size-related sexual dimorphism and a model of interspecific divergence in shape which strongly reflects size differences suggest a major role of size and size-related shape variation in the guenon radiation. It is possible that in the guenons, as in the neotropical primates (with whom they have obvious parallels), size has helped to determine morphological change along lines of least evolutionary resistance, influencing sexual dimorphism. In Miopithecus and Erythrocebus, the smallest and largest guenon genera, it is likely that the interaction of ecology and size contributes significantly to patterns of sexual dimorphism. The results of this study thus emphasise the need to consider allometry and size alongside ecology and behaviour when examining primate sexual dimorphism. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Savage (Eds.), Fossil Vertebrates of Africa, vol. 2, Academic Press, London, 1970, pp. 243-323] and Köhler [Skeleton and Habitat of Recent and Fossil Ruminants, Münchner Geowissenschaftliche Abdhandlungen 25 (1993) 1-88] have identified numerous discrete (non-metric) traits of the bovid postcranial skeleton that are said to be indicative of habitat preference. However, these traits have not been systematically tested on a modern bovid sample. We report here such a test. Eighty-six non-metric characters were evaluated using a sample of modern African bovids (n = 197). Of the 86 characters, 48 were either insufficiently defined or exhibited too much intra-individual variation to be potentially indicative of habitat. Two characters were invariant in the sample. Of the remaining 36 characters, 11 were sufficiently correlated with habitat preference (Cramer's V > 0.5) to be of some potential use in reconstructing paleohabitats. These characters are primarily concentrated on the phalanges, and provide a means by which fragmentary phalanges can be used for habitat reconstruction, albeit at a broad level of resolution (open or closed habitat). The estimated accuracy of these methods is greater than 80%. Their use on fragmentary remains may lessen the bias introduced by basing habitat reconstructions on more complete fossils. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The only conspicuous shape variation is in metapodial length, which sometimes differs significantly among genera that are similar in all other dimensions. It follows that Discriminant Analysis (DA) intended to identify metapodials to genus will depend primarily on size, and except for the occasional like-sized genera that differ in metapodial length, DA will often confuse genera of similar size. DA of the same metapodials subjected to PCA supports this prediction. PCA further shows that bovid species that favor the same habitat often differ in metapodial size, shape, or both, and species that favor different habitats often overlap substantially in their metapodial morphometrics. DA intended to assign metapodials to habitat will thus produce different results depending on the species used to characterize each habitat type and on the number of specimens by which each species is represented. Habitat reconstruction founded in DA is therefore taxon dependent rather than taxon-free, and it cannot supplant reconstruction based on taxonomic identifications below the family level. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

With this analysis we aim to provide an example of how geometric morphometrics can fruitfully be applied to the study of clinal variation in a widespread African monkey group by a simple extension of methods widely employed by macroecologists and biogeographers to multivariate shape data. Throughout the paper we aim to explain these techniques so that those who are new to them can use and adapt them for their own needs, in some cases providing specific instructions on how to perform certain operations in standard morphometrics and statistical software. Our hope is that this may stimulate morphometricians and scientists from other disciplines to explore geographic variation in size and shape using up-to-date geometric morphometric methods.

This genus is used as a major biostratigraphic tool within the Quaternary. Specific determinations using the Schmelzband-Differenzierung-Quotient or SDQ have identified many chronospecies within the fossil species Arvicola cantiana (Hinton, 1910). As SDQ calculation remains limited, this study reappraises the Arvicola genus in terms of morphodiversity and morphospace using outline analysis which takes into account the tooth as a whole. Outline analysis suggests that one single species of Arvicola, A. cantiana, was present during the Pleistocene. This species shows great variability with no trends or patterns in morphospace. Thus, these results call into question the reliability of SDQ for specific determinations and throw doubt on the biochronological framework based on Arvicola. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these measurements alone are unreliable because some specimens of M. pennsylvanicus overlap smaller individuals of M. xanthognathus in size. Therefore, I created and tested a morphometric technique that discriminates Recent lower 1st molars (mis) of M. pennsylvanicus from those of M. xanthognathus, and is applicable to other taxa (both modern and fossil).

The research presented here introduces the use of the non-parametric recursive partitioning method as a test of the linear discriminant method for predicting habitat from a collection of modern Bovid astragali from Southeast Asia.

In this paper we describe the results of a detailed magnetometry survey undertaken to investigate Roman settlement upon the floodplain. The study included the use of multilayer perceptron neural networks to further process the magnetic data and derive estimates of feature burial depths, allowing a three-dimensional reconstruction of buried subsurface remains to be made. The neural network approach potentially offers several advantages in terms of efficiency and flexibility over more conventional data inversion techniques. The paper demonstrates how this can lead to an enhanced interpretation of magnetic survey data, which when combined with other geoarchaeological data can provide a clearer picture of settlement evolution within the context of landscape change.

One exception is phyllite-tempered pottery, which was made in one corner of the basin but also across a broad upland zone adjacent to the north. The phyllite-tempered pottery from different production sources cannot be distinguished on the basis of their temper type. As shown with assays with an electron microprobe, however, both the temper and clay fractions are chemically diverse and geographically distinct, allowing many of the phyllite-tempered wares to be sourced. Among the phyllite-tempered ceramics consumed in the Phoenix basin, some are shown to have been made locally, but, surprisingly, large numbers were imported from the northern uplands.
