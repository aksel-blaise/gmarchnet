Modules are sets of traits that are internally integrated by interactions among traits, but are relatively independent from other modules. The interactions within modules rely on different mechanisms, depending on the context of a study. For morphological traits, modularity occurs in developmental, genetic, functional, and evolutionary contexts. A range of methods for quantifying integration and modularity in morphological data is available, and a number of comparative and experimental designs can be used to compare the different contexts. How development produces covariation between traits can have substantial implications for understanding genetic variation and the potential for evolutionary change, but research in this area has only begun and many questions remain unanswered.

Our sample consists of 38 crania: 20 modern adult Homo sapiens, 14 subadult H. sapiens, and four archaic Homo. All specimens were CT-scanned except for two infant H, sapiens, who were imaged by MR instead. For each specimen 84 landmarks and semilandmarks were located on the midsagittal plane and converted to Procrustes shape coordinates. Integration was quantified by the method of singular warps, a new geometric-statistical approach to visualizing correlations among regions. The two classic patterns of integration, evolutionary and ontogenetic, were jointly explored by comparing analyses of overlapping subsamples that span ranges of different hypothetical factors. Evolutionary integration is expressed in the subsample of 24 adult Homo, and ontogenetic integration in the subsample of 34 H. sapiens. In this data set, vault, cranial base, and face show striking and localized patterns of covariation over ontogeny, similar but not identical to the patterns seen over evolution. The principal differences between ontogeny and phylogeny pertain to the cranial base. There is also a component of cranial to height ratio not reducible to either process. Our methodology allows a separation of these independent processes (and their impact on cranial shape) that conventional methods have not found. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Data Sources: International computerized databases and published indices, experts in the field, conference proceedings, bibliographies. Study Selection/Data Extraction: Two hundred articles/texts on respiratory tract physiology and humidification were reviewed. Seventeen articles were selected from 40 articles for inclusion in the published data verification of the model. Selection was by independent reviewers. Extraction was by consensus, and was based on finding sufficient data. Data Synthesis: A relationship exists between inspired gas humidity and temperature, exposure time to a given humidity level, and mucosal function. This relationship can be modeled and represented as an inspired humidity magnitude vs. exposure time map. The model is predictive of mucosal function and can be partially verified by the available literature. It predicts that if inspired humidity deviates from an optimal level, a progressive mucosal dysfunction begins. The greater the humidity deviation, the faster the mucosal dysfunction progresses. Conclusions: A model for the relationship between airway mucosal dysfunction and the combination of the humidity of inspired gas and the duration over which the airway mucosa is exposed to that humidity is proposed. This model suggests that there is an optimal temperature and humidity above which, and below which, there is impaired mucosal function. This optimal level of temperature and humidity is core temperature and 100% relative humidity. However, existing data are only sufficient to test this model for gas conditions below core temperature and 100% relative humidity. These data concur with the model in that region. No studies have yet looked at this relationship beyond 24 hrs. Longer exposure times to any given level of inspired humidity and inspired gas temperatures and humidities above core temperature and 100% relative humidity need to be studied to fully verify the proposed model.","humidification; intratracheal intubation; lungs; mucociliary clearance; mucosa; respiratory mechanics; respiratory system","artificial ventilation; breathing mechanics; endotracheal intubation; human; humidity; mucociliary clearance; nonhuman; priority journal; respiratory failure; respiratory tract mucosa; review; temperature; Animals; Cilia; Heat; Humans; Humidity; Respiratory Physiology",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029803459

Some cranial regions, particularly the face and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because different cranial regions preserve population history and climate signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate adaptation; Craniofacial morphology; Human variation; Neutral genetics; Population history","accuracy; article; climate; correlation analysis; evolution; face; female; genetic distance; geometry; history; human; human tissue; hypothesis; male; morphology; morphometrics; normal human; phylogeny; population research; priority journal; reliability; skull; temporal bone; Acclimatization; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Climate; Continental Population Groups; Evolution; Face; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Temporal Bone; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845396793

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine this model by dividing it into two independent hypotheses: 1) the Upper Paleolithic population of Japan that gave rise to the Neolithic Jomon people was of southeast Asian origin, and 2) modern Ainu and Ryukyuan (Okinawa) populations are direct descendants of the Jomon people, while Hondo (Main Island)- Japanese are mainly derived from the migrants from the northeast Asian continent after the Aeneolithic Yayoi period. Our aim is to examine the extent to which the model is supported by genetic evidence from modern populations, particularly from Japan and other Asian areas. Based on genetic distance analyses using data from up to 25 'classic' genetic markers, we find first that the three Japanese populations including Ainu and Ryukyuan clearly belong to a northeast Asian cluster group. This negates the first hypothesis of the model. Then, we find that Ainu and Ryukyuans share a group contrasting with Hondo-Japanese and Korean, supporting the second hypothesis of the model. Based on these results, we propose a modified version of the dual structure model which may explain the genetic, morphological, and archaeological evidence concerning the formation of modern Japanese populations.","Ainu; Asian populations; genetic distance; origins of Japanese; Ryukyuan","article; evolution; genetic distance; genetic marker; human; hypothesis; Japan; paleoanthropology; physical anthropology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030971915

Two of these samples are artificially deformed (anteroposterior [AP] and circumferential [C] types). Measurements taken from lateral radiographs demonstrated that alternative forms of the cranial base angle (N‐S‐Ba, planum angle, planum sphenoidale to plane of the clivus and PANG angle, planum sphenoidale to basion‐sella plane) and the orbital and OANG angles (orbital roof to plane of the clivus and basion‐sella plane, respectively) of both deformed groups increased while the angle S‐Ba‐O decreased significantly with respect to the undeformed (N) sample. Changes in the AP group are largely due to anteroinferior displacement of the basion‐sella plane. Similar changes in group C are amplified by this group's posterosuperior frontal migration. This migration results in a relatively shallow orbit at the orbital plate/frontal squama interface. Unlike the deformation experienced by the external vault plates, the basion‐sella plane orientation remains stable with respect to the Frankfort Horizontal. Additionally, nasal region measurements such as maximum nasal aperture breadth and nasal height were largely stable between each deformed group and the undeformed group. However, facial (bimaxillary and bizygomatic), basicranial, cranial, and frontal breadths decreased significantly from group AP to group N to group C. Thus, gross morphological facial changes between each undeformed group and the control group are largely accounted for by dimensional changes in peripheral structures. These results stress the importance of the dynamic interrelationship between the cranial vault and base in the development of the craniofacial complex.

Recent consensus views cranial morphology as largely indicative of population history in humans, with some anatomical cranial regions/measurements being more informative on population history, while others being under selection pressure. We test earlier findings using the largest and most diverse cranial dataset available as yet: 7,423 male specimens from 135 geographic human population samples represented by 33 standard craniometric linear measurements. We calculated Mahalanobis D 2 for three datasets: complete cranial dataset; facial measurement dataset; and neurocranial measurement dataset; these morphological distance matrices were then compared to matrices of geographic distances as well as of several climatic variables. Additionally, we calculated Fst values for our cranial measurements and compared the results to the expected Fst values for neutral genetic loci. Our findings support the hypothesis that cranial, and especially neurocranial morphology, is phylogenetically informative, and that aspects of the face and cranium are subject to selection related to climatic factors. The Fst analysis suggest that selection to climate is largely restricted to groups living in extremely cold environments, including Northeast Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, though each of these regions appears to have arrived at their morphology through distinct adaptive pathways. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adaptation; Craniometrics; Fst; Human variation; Neanderthals; Population history","anatomical variation; article; climate; controlled study; data base; geography; human; human tissue; male; morphology; phylogeny; population; population differentiation; priority journal; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Asia; Cephalometry; Climate; Cold Climate; Europe; Evolution; Facial Bones; Fossils; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Male; North America; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Population; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449643229

The argument is based principally on the observation that nasal height is globally more variable than nasal breadth, with nasal breadth thus contributing little to variation in the index. This argument does not take into account the confounding effect of absolute size of these variables on their variances. In this study we compare the intrinsic variation in skeletal nasal height and breadth within and among 26 mixed‐sex populations (N = 2,408) at globally diverse localities (Howells, 1989), using 2 × 2 variance‐covariance matrices of the logarithmically transformed variates. Hypothesis tests for homogeneity of matrices and equalvariance/equal‐covariance indicate that the intrinsic variation in nasal breadth is greater than that for nasal height within populations, and that nasal breadth and nasal height exhibit equivalent intrinsic variation among populations. The argument that nasal breadth contributes little to the worldwide variation in the human nasal index is rejected. Given our present understanding of nasal physiological morpho‐function, these results support, but do not demonstrate, an adaptive role for human nasal index variation. Promising methods for elucidating natural selection on human nasal form are suggested.

Anthropology/Anatomy, Duke University, Box 90383, Durham, NC 27708, United States","Airflow dynamics are recognized as being important to the functioning of the human nose in conditioning and filtering inspired air, yet these dynamics are poorly understood. Despite considerable research on airflow dynamics by otolaryngologists, respiratory physiologists, and toxicologists, major disagreements remain about the nature of airflow in the human nose. Specifically, there is little consensus about the character of nasal airflow regimes (laminar or turbulent) and about the major pathways of airflow through the internal chamber. Additionally, a number of features in the human nose have been argued to enhance airflow turbulence, thus increasing the exposure of moving air to the nasal mucosa and facilitating heat and moisture exchange in cold and/or dry climates. These features include: an inferior orientation of the nares; a nasal sill that is high relative to the floor of the internal nasal chamber; a nasal valve that is small in cross-sectional area relative to that of the internal chamber; and large, projecting conchae. The claim that these features affect airflow dynamics has never been tested. To clarify the nature of human nasal airflow and to test these claims of functional significance to nasal variation, we studied airflow across physiological flow rates using water and dye flowing through anatomically accurate acrylic models of human nasal air passageways (with adjustment of water flow rates to maintain dynamic similarity). The models were derived from direct casting of the nasal passageways of 10 Caucasian (""leptorrhine"") cadavers (six male, four female). Measures of naris angle, nasal sill height, nasal valve area relative to internal chamber cross-sectional area, and relative projection of the inferior and middle turbinates were taken directly on the resulting casts. The relationships between aspects of nasal morphology and turbulent air flow were evaluated by examining the flow regimes (laminar, semiturbulent, or turbulent) at varying flow rates, with the expectation that the greater the development of the proposed turbulence-enhancing features the slower the flow rate at which flow would shift from one regime to another. Flow characteristics (both flow regimes and principal pathways) were highly variable within our sample. The relative projection of the inferior turbinate was the only variable that significantly affected the flow rate at which flow became turbulent. However, more projecting turbinates appear to laminate flow rather than to induce turbulence. Nostril orientation was moderately correlated with flow dynamics (with more inferiorly directed nares producing turbulence at slower flow rates), but this correlation was not statistically significant. Relative nasal valve area and nasal sill height were unrelated to turbulence in our models. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"dye; adult; aged; airway dynamics; anatomical variation; article; biological model; cadaver; Caucasian; controlled study; correlation function; craniofacial morphology; facial bone; female; flow rate; functional anatomy; human; human tissue; laminar airflow; male; nose airflow; nose cavity; priority journal; statistical significance; turbulent flow; water flow; Algorithms; Cadaver; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological; Nose; Pulmonary Ventilation; Turbinates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-8744244366

The temperature increase should be similar to a heated tube model, depending on the airflow. Study Design: Intranasal temperature values of 50 volunteers were measured after inspiration at different locations: nasal vestibule, nasal valve area, anterior to the head of the middle turbinate, and the nasopharynx. Temperature values were related to nasal airway resistance data. Methods: Intranasal temperature measurements were made with a miniaturized thermocouple. Nasal airway resistance was detected by active anterior rhinomanometry. Results: A logarithmic increase of air temperature from the anterior segment of the nose to the posterior part was noted. In the nasopharynx temperature was approximately 34°C. The highest increase in temperature was observed in the nasal valve area. Conclusions: The temperature increase of ambient air in the nasal airways can be compared with a logarithmic curve of the heating of air passing a heated tube. As the heating of air is important for water transport, the space between the nasal valve and the middle turbinate is of special functional importance.

Because humans inhabit environments that can be seen as extreme from the perspective of respiratory function, nasal cavity shape is expected to show climatic adaptation. This study examines the relationship between modern human variation in the morphology of the nasal cavity and the climatic factors of temperature and vapor pressure, and tests the hypothesis that within increasingly demanding environments (colder and drier), nasal cavities will show features that enhance turbulence and air-wall contact to improve conditioning of the air. We use three-dimensional geometric morphometrics methods and multivariate statistics to model and analyze the shape of the bony nasal cavity of 10 modern human population samples from five climatic groups. We report significant correlations between nasal cavity shape and climatic variables of both temperature and humidity. Variation in nasal cavity shape is correlated with a cline from cold-dry climates to hot-humid climates, with a separate temperature and vapor pressure effect. The bony nasal cavity appears mostly associated with temperature, and the nasopharynx with humidity. The observed climate-related shape changes are functionally consistent with an increase in contact between air and mucosal tissue in cold-dry climates through greater turbulence during inspiration and a higher surface-to-volume ratio in the upper nasal cavity.

STUDY DESIGN: A literature review. METHODS: The review includes human epidemiological studies, human and animal experimental studies, as well as human studies about management of the cold air-provoked respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: Cold air is unlikely to be a causal factor initiating respiratory diseases but a symptom trigger. In the present review, the airway responses beyond these symptoms were divided into three types. The short-term responses are those that develop within minutes in response to sudden cooling of the airways. Subjects with asthma or rhinitis are especially prone to these responses. The long-term responses are those that develop in response to repeated and long-standing cooling and drying of the airways, usually in endurance athletes. Finally, there are the physiological, reflex-mediated lower-airway responses to cooling of the skin or upper airways. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanisms beyond cold air-provoked respiratory symptoms vary considerably and mainly depend on the individual's susceptibility and the ventilation level during the cold exposure. An understanding of these mechanisms is essential for successful management of the symptoms.",,"animal; asthma; bronchospasm; chronic obstructive lung disease; cold climate; dehydration; exercise; human; lung lavage; pathophysiology; physiology; respiratory tract disease; respiratory tract mucosa; review; rhinitis; Animals; Asthma; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Bronchoconstriction; Cold Climate; Dehydration; Exercise; Humans; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Respiratory Mucosa; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Rhinitis",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34347264165

We delivered cold, dry air (19-1°C, <10% relative humidity) or hot, humid air (37°C, >90% relative humidity) to the nose via a nasal mask at flow rates of 5, 10, and 20 1/min. We used a water gradient across the nose (water content in nasopharynx minus water content of delivered air) to assess nasal function. We studied the characteristics of nasal air conditioning in 22 asymptomatic, seasonally allergic subjects (out of their allergy season) and 11 nonallergic normal subjects. Inhalation of hot, humid air at increasingly higher flow rates had little effect on both the relative humidity and the temperature of air in the nasopharynx. In both groups, increasing the flow of cold, dry air lowered both the temperature and the water content of the inspired air measured in the nasopharynx, although the relative humidity remained at 100%. Water gradient values obtained during cold dry air challenges on separate days showed reproducibility in both allergic and nonallergic subjects. After exposure to cold, dry air, the water gradient was significantly lower in allergic than in nonallergic subjects (1,430 ± 45 vs. 1,718 ± 141 mg; P = 0.02), suggesting an impairment in their ability to warm and humidify inhaled air.","Allergy; Humidification; Nasal air conditioning; Temperature; Water gradient","adult; air conditioning; air temperature; allergy; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; humidity; humidity meter; inhalation; male; nasopharynx; nose; priority journal; reproducibility; temperature measurement; water content; Adult; Air; Female; Humans; Humidity; Male; Nasal Cavity; Nasopharynx; Nose; Reproducibility of Results; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Temperature",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032799274

The results of the numerical simulation were compared with in vivo temperature measurements. Results: The numerical simulation demonstrated that the major increase of the inspiratory air temperature can be found in the anterior nasal segment, especially within the nasal valve area, which is comparable to in vivo measurements. Intranasal areas of high temperature were characterized by turbulent airflow with vortices of low velocity. The results of numerical simulation showed an excellent comparability to the results of previous in vivo measurements in the entire nasal cavity. Conclusion: The anterior nasal segment is the most effective part of the nose in heating of the ambient air.

Concurrent measurements of Thoracic Gas Volume (TGV)_and Airway Resistance during nose breathing (Raw (n)) were made using the plethysmographic technique. The percentage contribution of Rn to Raw (n) was significantly higher in the Caucasian infants (mean 49.2 ± 7.5 (SD) %), than in the Negro infants (mean 31.1 ± 6.8 (SD) %), which probably resulted from anatomical differences in nasal structure. In each infant, Rn was subtracted from Raw (n) in order to assess resistance, and its reciprocal, conductance (Gaw), during mouth breathing. A strong linear relationship was found to exist between Gaw (m) and TGV throughout the first year of life (r = 0.92), with no significant difference between Negro and Caucasian infants. Specific Airway Conductance during mouth breathing (SGaw (m) = Gaw (m)/TGV) was found to be considerably higher during infancy than at any other time during life, which may help to at least partially compensate for the fact that newborn infants are obligatory nose breathers. © 1978.","Airway resistance; Airways; Nasal resistance; Newborn","airway resistance; ethnic or racial aspects; human cell; infant; newborn; normal human; normal value; nose airway resistance; respiratory system; rhinomanometry; Airway Resistance; Caucasoid Race; Human; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Nasal Cavity; Negroid Race",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018085844

A high surface-area- to-volume (SA/V) ratio allows relatively more air to come in contact with the mucosa and facilitates more efficient heat and moisture exchange during inspiration and expiration, which would be adaptive in a cold, dry environment. Conversely, a low SA/V ratio is not as efficient at recapturing heat and moisture during expiration and allows for better heat dissipation, which would be adaptive in a warm, humid environment. To test this hypothesis, cross-sectional measurements of the nasal passages that reflect surface area and volume were collected from a sample of CT scans of patients of European and African ancestry. Results indicate that individuals of European descent do have higher SA/V ratios than individuals of African descent, but only when decongested. Otherwise, the two groups show little difference. This pattern of variation may be due to selection for different SA/V configurations during times of physical exertion, which has been shown to elicit decongestion. Relationships between linear measurements of the skeletal nasal aperture and cavity and cross-sectional dimensions were also examined. Contrary to predictions, the nasal index, the ratio of nasal breadth to nasal height, is not strongly correlated with internal dimensions. However, differences between the nasal indices of the two groups are highly significant. These results may be indicative of different adaptive solutions to the same problem. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adaptation; Climate; Nose","African Continental Ancestry Group; Ecology; Ethmoid Bone; European Continental Ancestry Group; Exhalation; Geography; Humans; Humidity; Inhalation; Nose; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Turbinates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149486657

Interestingly, one character that deviates from this pattern is a relatively wide nasal aperture. The ecogeographical patterning of the nasal aperture in recent humans would predict instead that Neandertals should exhibit reduced nasal breadth dimensions. To explain this apparent anomaly it has been argued that a reduction in Neandertal nasal breadth was not possible due to dentognathic constraints on their midfaces via large anterior palatal breadth dimensions, especially large intercanine distances. A complicating factor in understanding the relationship between anterior palate breadth and nasal breadth is that both measurements are also correlated with facial prognathism. It is, therefore, unknown to what degree the relationship between anterior palate breadth and nasal breadth in Neandertals is a function of the pleisiomorphic retention of a prognathic facial skeleton. We used path analysis to test for a causal relationship between intercanine breadth and nasal breadth taking into account the potential effect of facial projection and facial prognathism (i.e., basion-nasion length and basion-prosthion length) using a large sample of geographically diverse recent and fossil Homo. Additionally, we examined the ontogenetic relationship between nasal breadth and intercanine breadth using a longitudinal human growth series to determine whether these variables exhibit similar growth trajectories. The results of these analyses indicate a weaker association between intercanine breadth and nasal breadth than expected, and that more variation in nasal breadth can be explained through basion-prosthion length rather than anterior palatal breadth dimensions. Moreover, the ontogenetic development of anterior palate breadth does not correspond to the growth trajectory of the breadth of the nose. These results explain the apparent paradox of wide piriform apertures in generally cooler climate-adapted Neandertals without resorting to dentognathic constraints, and provide additional insight into both the adaptive and nonadaptive (i.e., neutral) basis for Neandertal facial evolution. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These hypotheses have been used subsequently to support the phylogenetic placement of fossil taxa relative to the living Hominoidea. The null hypothesis, that no change in sinus volume independent of size has occurred in ape evolution, is evaluated here by scaling analysis. Mixed sex samples of adult dry crania for the extant ape genera were examined by computer tomography imaging and the volume of the maxillary sinus was obtained. Sinus volume was then regressed, using both least squares and reduced major axis models, against cranial size variables. The results clearly demonstrate that the null hypothesis of no change in relative sinus volume cannot be rejected; thus, there is no support for hypotheses that maxillary sinus volume, independent of cranial size, has changed in the course of hominoid evolution. This result, in turn, has implications for the phylogenetic placement of fossil taxa and highlights the need for the careful delineation of character states in studies of hominoid systematics.","Allometry; Apes; Paranasal sinuses","evolution; phylogeny; Alocasia macrorrhizos; Animalia; Crania; Haplorhini; Hominidae; Hominidae; Hominoidea; Homo; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034029933

Here we present a study of one East Asian and seven North Asian populations in which we examine the evidence for convergent adaptations of the mid-face to a very cold climate. Our findings indicate that mid-facial morphology is strongly associated with climatic variables that contrast the temperate climate of East Asians and the very cold and dry climate of North Asians. This is also the case when either maxillary or nasal cavity measurements are considered alone. The association remains significant when mtDNA distances among populations are taken into account. The morphological contrasts between populations are consistent with physiological predictions and prior studies of mid-facial cold adaptation in more temperate regions, but among North Asians there appear to be some previously undescribed morphological features that might be considered as adaptive to extreme cold. To investigate this further, analyses of the seven North Asian populations alone suggest that mid-facial morphology remains strongly associated with climate, particularly winter precipitation, contrasting coastal Arctic and continental climates. However, the residual covariation among North Asian mid-facial morphology and climate when genetic distances are considered, is not significant. These findings point to modern adaptations to extreme climate that might be relevant to our understanding of the mid-facial morphology of fossil hominins that lived during glaciations.

These purported autapomorphies include (i) the development of an internal nasal margin bearing a well developed and vertically oriented medial projection; (ii) a pronounced medial swelling of the lateral nasal wall into the posterior nasal cavity; and (iii) the lack of an ossified roof over the lacrimal groove.

Regression analysis has yielded quantitative estimates of the effect on a given dimension of variation in one or more of the others. It seems probable that both nasal shape and the maxillary dental arch‐prognathism complex may be subject to direct selection by environmental stress. The morphological association between these complexes suggests that a part of the interpopulation variation in prognathism may be a secondary effect of selection acting on the nose.

Jomon people were the descendents of Pleistocene nomads who migrated to the Japanese Islands around 30,000 yBP. Phenotypic and genotypic evidence indicates that Yayoi people were recent migrants to Japan from continental Northeast Asia who likely interbred with Jomon foragers. Limb proportions of Jomon and Yayoi people were compared using RMA regression and ""Quick-Test"" calculations to investigate relative variability between these two groups. Cluster and principal components analyses were performed on size-standardized limb lengths and used to compare Jomon and Yayoi people with other groups from various climatic zones. Elongated distal relative to proximal limb lengths were observed among Jomon compared to Yayoi people. Jomon limb proportions were similar to human groups from temperate/tropical climates at lower latitudes, while Yayoi limb proportions more closely resemble groups from colder climates at higher latitudes. Limb proportional similarities with groups from warmer environments among Jomon foragers likely reflect morphological changes following Pleistocene colonization of the Japanese Islands. Cold-derived limb proportions among the Yayoi people likely indicate retention of these traits following comparatively recent migrations to the Japanese Islands.

Previous studies indicate that the maxillary sinuses may play a key role in accommodating climatically induced nasal variation such that a decrease in nasal cavity volume is associated with a concomitant increase in maxillary sinus volume. However, due to conflicting results in previous studies, the precise interaction of the nasal cavity and maxillary sinuses, in humans, is unclear. This is likely due to the prior emphasis on nasal cavity size, whereas arguably, nasal cavity shape is more important with regard to the interaction with the maxillary sinuses. Using computed tomography scans of living human subjects (N=40), the goal of this study is to assess the interaction between nasal cavity form and maxillary sinus volume in European- and African-derived individuals with differences in nasal cavity morphology. First, we assessed whether there is an inverse relationship between nasal cavity and maxillary sinus volumes. Next, we examined the relationship between maxillary sinus volume and nasal cavity shape using multivariate regression. Our results show that there is a positive relationship between nasal cavity and maxillary sinus volume, indicating that the maxillary sinuses do not accommodate variation in nasal cavity size. However, maxillary sinus volume is significantly correlated with variation in relative internal nasal breadth.

By contrast, during exercise, sex explains VO2 and VV better than do body size factors, probably because hormone-mediated muscularity in males produced greater work output.

Acknowledging vault modifications, researchers have sought measurements in other regions which are unaffected by deformation. In the 1970s, a set of 10 ""relatively"" unaffected facial measurements was identified in Argentinean crania that later became the basis of numerous South American biodistance studies. These measurements include: minimum frontal breadth, bizygomatic breadth, orbit height, orbit breadth, palate breath, palate length, upper facial height, basion-prosthion length, nasal height, and nasal breadth. Palate length was excluded from the present analysis due to considerable measurement error. The suitability of these measurements in populations other than Argentineans has not been rigorously tested. Using a sample of 350 prehistoric crania from the Museo Arqueológico San Miguel de Azapa (MASMA, Arica, Chile), this project tested the hypothesis that these measurements are unaffected by either annular or tabular deformation. Results obtained from MANOVA analysis indicate this hypothesis cannot be fully supported. Among males, only 3 of the 9 measurements are unaffected by either form of deformation (palate breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth), while analysis of females indicates that 4 of the 9 measurements remain unaltered (minimum frontal breadth, orbit breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth). Additionally, analogous to the vault, facial measurements display patterns consistent with the deformation applied. Two implications can be drawn from this research: 1) previous studies using these measurements must be interpreted cautiously, and 2) researchers using these measurements must explicitly test their suitability in each population. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Artificial; Biodistance; Craniofacial; Face; Intentional; South America","Argentina; article; calculation; Chile; craniofacial morphology; face malformation; geological time; measurement; multivariate analysis of variance; palate; population distribution; skull malformation; Cephalometry; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Facial Bones; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Skull; South America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746217091

The major findings are as follows. (1) Island Southeast Asians have retained some archaic and generalized craniofacial forms to the present day. (2) No Neolithic craniofacial clines can be found across East/Northeast Asia. Instead, there seems to be a boundary at about the northern part of China. North of the boundary occur the Neolithic Northeast Asians, marked by their characteristic craniofacial morphology, and south of the boundary is occupied by the generalized Asian populations. (3) The terminal and post-Neolithic expansion of the populations in the northern part of East Asia to the south could have been the main cause for the rapid change in the craniofacial features of the post-Neolithic inhabitants in China and Japan.

Although several studies have reported different morphological patterns of sexual dimorphism in different populations, this study searches for common morphological aspects related to functional anatomy of the respiratory apparatus. 3D geometric morphometrics were used to test the hypothesis that due to higher daily energy expenditure and associated greater respiratory air consumption as well as differences in body composition, males should have absolutely and relatively greater air passages in the bony cranial airways than females. We measured 25 3D landmarks in five populations (N = 212) of adult humans from different geographic regions. Male average cranial airways were larger in centroid sizes than female ones. Males tended to show relatively taller piriform apertures and, more consistently, relatively taller internal nasal cavities and choanae than females. Multivariate regressions and residual analysis further indicated that after standardizing to the same size, males still show relatively larger airway passages than females. Because the dimensions of the choanae are limiting factors for air transmission towards the noncranial part of the respiratory system, the identified sex-specific differences in cranial airways, possibly shared among human populations, may be linked with sex-specific differences in body size, composition, and energetics. These findings may be important to understanding trends in hominin facial evolution. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","cranial airways; geometric morphometrics; human craniofacial variation; respiratory apparatus","adult; airway; anatomical variation; article; body size; craniofacial morphology; evolution; female; geometry; hominid; human; male; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; regression analysis; respiratory system; sex difference; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Continental Population Groups; Female; Fossils; Humans; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Regression Analysis; Sex Characteristics; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054119001

In this study, we articulate a methodology for collecting volumetric data for the MS and nasal cavity (NC) from computed tomography (CT) scans and report details for a small sample of 39 dried human crania of known ecogeographic provenience useful for assessing variation in MS size and shape. We use scaling analyses to preliminarily test the hypothesis that volumes of the nasal cavity (NCV) and maxillary sinus (MSV) are inversely correlated such that the NC covaries with size of the face, whereas the MS ""fills in"" the leftover space [proposed by Shea: Am J Phys Anthropol 47 (1977):289-300]. Against expectation, MSV is not significantly correlated with NCV or any cranial size variable. NCV, on the other hand, scales isometrically with facial size. The results of this pilot study suggest that NCV covaries with facial size, but that the MS does not simply fill in the leftover space in the face. The role, if any, of the MSs in midfacial function and architecture remains unclear. Larger sample sizes, additional environmental variables, and assessment of MS and NC shape are necessary to resolve this issue.

This investigation augments traditional craniofacial morphometrics with internal linear and volumetric measures of the anatomic units comprising the nasal complex (i.e., internal nasal cavity depth, maxillary sinus volumes). The study focuses on macaques (i.e., Macaca mulatta and Macaca fascicularis) living at high and low altitudes, rather than on humans, since the short residency of migratory human populations may preclude using them as reliable models to test the long-term relationship of climate to nasal morphology. It is hypothesized that there will be significant differences in nasal complex morphology among macaques inhabiting different climates. This study integrated three different approaches: CT imaging, comparative anatomy, and morphometrics - in an effort to better understand the morphological structure and adaptive nature of the nasal complex. Results showed statistically significant differences when subsets of splanchnocranial and neurocranial variables were regressed against total maxillary sinus volume for particular taxa. For example, basion-hormion was significant for M. fascicularis, whereas choanal dimensions were significant only for M. mulatta. Both taxa revealed strong correlation between sinus volume and prosthion to staphylion distance, which essentially represents the length of the nasal cavity floor - and is by extension an indicator of the air conditioning capacity of the nasal region. These results clearly show that climatic effects play a major role in shaping the anatomy of the nasal complex in closely related species. The major influence upon these differing structures appears to be related to respiratory-related adaptations subserving differing climatic factors. In addition, the interdependence of the paranasal sinuses with other parts of the complex strongly indicates a functional role for them in nasal complex/upper respiratory functions. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate; Craniofacial architecture; Form-function; Maxillary sinus volume; Pneumatization","acclimatization; altitude; animal; article; body size; climate; ecosystem; environment; histology; image processing; information center; Macaca; nose; physiology; reproducibility; Acclimatization; Altitude; Animals; Body Size; Climate; Ecosystem; Environment; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Macaca fascicularis; Macaca mulatta; Museums; Nose; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149337396

The demonstrable relationship between temperature and morphology in extant primates (including humans) forms the basis of the interpretation of the Pleistocene hominin Homo neanderthalensis as a cold-adapted species. There are contradictory signals, however, in the pattern of primate craniofacial changes associated with climatic conditions. To determine the direction and extent of craniofacial change associated with temperature, and to understand the proximate mechanisms underlying cold adaptations in vertebrates in general, dry crania from previous experiments on cold- and warm-reared rats were investigated using computed tomography scanning and three-dimensional digitization of cranial landmarks. Aspects of internal and external cranial morphology were compared using standard statistical and geometric morphometric techniques. The results suggest that the developmental response to cold stress produces subtle but significant changes in facial shape, and a relative decrease in the volume of the maxillary sinuses (and nasal cavity), both of which are independent of the size of the skull or postcranium. These changes are consistent with comparative studies of temperate climate primates, but contradict previous interpretations of cranial morphology of Pleistocene Hominini. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Cranial pneumatization; Geometric morphometrics; Paranasal sinuses","adaptation; climate change; cold tolerance; cranium; fossil record; morphology; Pleistocene; primate; rodent; temperature effect; adaptation; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; anthropology; article; cold stress; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; fossil; human; morphology; nonhuman; paranasal sinus; Pleistocene; priority journal; rat; statistical significance; Student t test; Crania; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Primates; Rattus; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750023188

Therefore variation in the size and shape of these central craniofacial structures could have important consequences for the surrounding midfacial morphology during development and evolution. Yet such interactions are unclear because one school of thought, based on experimental and developmental evidence, suggests a relative independence (modularity) of these two facial compartments, whereas another one assumes tight morphological integration. This study uses geometric morphometrics of modern humans (N = 263) and 40 three-dimensional-landmarks of the skeletal nasopharynx and nasal cavity and outer midfacial skeleton to analyze these questions in terms of modularity. The sizes of all facial compartments were all strongly correlated. Shape integration was high between the cranial airways and the outer midfacial skeleton and between the latter and the anterior airway openings (skeletal regions close to and including piriform aperture). However, no shape integration was detected between outer midface and posterior airway openings (nasopharynx and choanae). Similarly, no integration was detected between posterior and anterior airway openings. This may reflect functional modularization of nasal cavity compartments related to respiratory physiology and differential developmental interactions with the face. Airway size likely relates to the energetics of the organism, whereas airways shape might be more indicative of respiratory physiology and climate. Although this hypothesis should be addressed in future steps, here we suggest that selection on morphofunctional characteristics of the cranial airways could have cascading effects for the variation, development, and evolution of the human face.

Similarly, recent studies of the adult human nasal region have documented key differences in nasal form between males and females that are potentially linked to sexual dimorphism in body size, composition, and energetics. To better understand this potential developmental and functional dynamic, we first assessed sexual dimorphism in the nasal cavity in recent humans to determine when during ontogeny male-female differences in nasal cavity size appear. Next, we assessed whether there are significant differences in nasal/body size scaling relationships in males and females during ontogeny. Using a mixed longitudinal sample we collected cephalometric and anthropometric measurements from n = 20 males and n = 18 females from 3.0 to 20.0+ years of age totaling n = 290 observations. We found that males and females exhibit similar nasal size values early in ontogeny and that sexual dimorphism in nasal size appears during adolescence. Moreover, when scaled to body size, males exhibit greater positive allometry in nasal size compared to females. This differs from patterns of sexual dimorphism in overall facial size, which are already present in our earliest age groups. Sexually dimorphic differences in nasal development and scaling mirror patterns of ontogenetic variation in variables associated with oxygen consumption and tissue maintenance.

Objective of review: To determine if there is any clinical relevance of the shape and size of the nose in relation to physiology, pathology and surgery. Type of review: Systematic review. Search strategy: A structured search of PubMed was performed from 1966 to 2008 for each section of the review focusing on the ethnic variations in nasal index, the effect of climate of nasal shape, ethic variations of nasal physiology and racial predilection for sinonasal pathology. Results: Nasal proportions do vary between ethnic groups but the size and shape of the nose does not define Caucasian, Asian and African races respectively. Anthropologists agree that the nasal variations are due to man's adaptation to the environment. However, this theory remains to be proven. Published data on nasal physiology have not shown significant differences between the ethnic groups despite obvious differences in nasal proportions. There is no evidence of ethnic specific predilection to disease due to anatomical variation, physiological vulnerability or genetic susceptibility. Rhinology research is often confounded by classifying populations according to race, as racial characteristics are not based on any scientific principles and the nasal index may be a more reliable discriminator. The only area in which the size and shape of the nose is of relevance is in aesthetic and reconstruction surgery. Conclusions: Nasal proportions are important aesthetically but appear to have little relevance to the rhinologist. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"adaptation; comparative anatomy; esthetic surgery; ethnic difference; genetic susceptibility; human; nose; nose disease; pathophysiology; physical anthropology; plastic surgery; priority journal; race difference; review; Continental Population Groups; Ethnic Groups; Geography; Humans; Mucociliary Clearance; Nose; Otolaryngology",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-66949146925

The two zones differ chiefly by a two-fold higher annual rainfall in the Sudanian zone. The pattern of differences in body weight, skinfold and limb circumferences suggests that the Sahelians allot proportionally more food and/or less physical work to women than the Sudanians. In one or both sexes, Sahelians have significantly longer lower limbs and forearms, larger hands and ears, a narrower face, and a higher and narrower nose. Sexual dimorphism of the shoulder-hip-width proportions is lower in the Sahelians, resulting from the Sahelian males, but not females, having wider hips, whereas Sahelians of both sexes have narrower shoulders. Multivariate analysis using D2 distances shows Sahelian and Sudanian populations forming two separate clusters, with the exception of the Dogon. In the male sex, nose width and sitting height account for the total multivariate interpopulational variation; nose width alone separates the two zonal groups, again with the Dogon as an exception. The position of the Dogon near to Sudanian populations while living in the Sahelian zone is explained by their migration from the Sudanian zone a few centuries ago.

Levy Place, New York, NY, United States","Neanderthals are one of the most intensely studied groups of extinct humans, as aspects of their phylogeny and functional morphology remain controversial. They have long been described as cold adapted but recent analyses of their nasal anatomy suggest that traits formerly considered adaptations may be the result of genetic drift. This study performs quantitative and qualitative analysis of aspects of the nasal complex (NC) in Neanderthals and other later Pleistocene fossils from Europe and Africa. A geographically diverse sample of modern human crania was used to establish an anatomical baseline for populations inhabiting cold and tropical climates. Nasofrontal angle, piriform aperture dimensions, and relative maxillary sinus volume were analyzed along with qualitative features of the piriform aperture rim. Results indicate that Neanderthals and other later Pleistocene Homo possessed NC's that align them with tropical modern humans. Thus comparison of Neanderthal nasal morphology with that of modern humans from cold climates may not be appropriate as differences in overall craniofacial architecture may constrain the narrowing of the piriform apertures in Neanderthals. They retain primitively long, low crania, large maxillary sinuses, and large piriform aperture area similar to mid-Pleistocene Homo specimens such as Petralona 1 and Kabwe 1. Adaptation to cold climate may have necessitated other adaptations such as bony medial projections at the piriform aperture rim and, potentially, midfacial prognathism. Nasal complex components of the upper respiratory tract remain a critical but poorly understood area that may yet offer novel insight into one of the greatest continuing controversies in paleoanthropology.

The role of the septum as a facial growth center, however, has been studied primarily in long-snouted mammals, and its precise influence on human facial growth is not as well understood. Whereas the nasal septum may be important in the anterior growth of the human facial skeleton early in ontogeny, the high incidence of nasal septal deviation in humans suggests the septum's influence on human facial length is limited to the early phases of facial growth. Nevertheless, the nasal septum follows a growth trajectory similar to the facial skeleton and, as such, its prolonged period of growth may influence other aspects of facial development. Using computed tomography scans of living human subjects (n=70), the goal of the present study is to assess the morphological relationship between the nasal septum and facial skeleton in European- and African-derived populations, which have been shown to exhibit early developmental differences in the nasal septal-premaxillary complex. First we assessed whether there is population variation in the size of the nasal septum in European- and African-derived samples. This included an evaluation of septal deviation and the spatial constraints that influence variation in this condition. Next, we assessed the relationship between nasal septal size and craniofacial shape using multivariate regression techniques. Our results indicate that there is significant population variation in septal size and magnitude of septal deviation, both of which are greater in the European-derived sample. While septal deviation suggests a disjunction between the nasal septum and other components of the facial skeleton, we nevertheless found a significant relationship between the size of the nasal septum and craniofacial shape, which appears to largely be a response to the need to accommodate variation in nasal septal size. © 2012 The Authors.

They expanded rapidly along the north-eastern coast of Hokkaido where archaeological evidence suggests an increasing dependence on hunting marine mammals. In this study, we present the results of carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of 18 faunal (including two domesticated dogs) and 58 adult human skeletons excavated from the Moyoro site of the Okhotsk culture in eastern Hokkaido. Although the mean human isotope ratios did not differ between sexes, the variances of carbon isotope ratios were significantly greater in males. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios suggest that the Moyoro humans and dogs heavily depended on marine foods for their dietary protein intake. The Bayesian mixing model suggests that humans obtained a maximum of 80-90% of their dietary protein from marine mammals, whereas domesticated dogs obtained 2-33%, 3-40%, and 5-45% of dietary protein from brackish-water fish, marine fish, and marine mammals, respectively. This suggests an avoidance of significant dietary overlap between the sympatrically living humans and dogs at the Moyoro site. Significant maritime adaptation would have enabled the subsistence of the Okhotsk people in the harsh northern environment of Hokkaido. © 2014 The Anthropological Society of Nippon.","Feeding ecology; Hokkaido; Hunter-gatherer-fisher; Maritime adaptation; Palaeodiet",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906821069

The Yukagir remain intermediate between the Baikal and Central Asian groups, while the Evenki are isolated from other Siberians, probably because of their small sample size. The Neolithic Baikalian are close to the Amur peoples, while the Troitskoe of the Mo-ho culture from the Amur basin show some close affinities with the Central Asian group. Because the Central Asian group peoples are more similar to the Northern Chinese than to the Neolithic Baikalian, the former two seem likely to have interacted with each other since the Neolithic age.

This modification is produced during early morphogenesis through the use of devices that alter the normal growth and development, to obtain a culturally established model. This paper, using a large cranial sample from the South Central Andes (1586 individuals), describes and documents a detailed morphometric study of the changes affecting the vault, cranial base, face, orbits and nasal region resulting from the tabular erect (TE), tabular oblique (TO), circular erect (CE) and circular oblique (CO) deformations with respect to the model without deformation. Data from 17 metric variables were processed by a one-way ANOVA and LSD test for paired comparisons. All of the deformation types produce significant morphometric divergence in most of the anatomical structures of the skull. The TE exhibits: a restriction of antero-posterior growth producing expansion in cranial width and height, frontal flattening, shortening of the face and cranial base, widening of the face, increased nasal and orbit height (ORH) and a foramen magnum size increase. The TO exhibits: most change reflected in the widening of the cranial vault, shortening of the cranial base and face, frontal flattening, increased nasal and ORH and foramen magnum size decrease. The CE style exhibits: a decrease in cranial width and strong increase in the cranial height, a reduction in frontal width, expansion of the cranial base and face, increased nasal and ORH, orbital widening and a foramen magnum size increase. The CO style exhibits: a decrease of the cranial vault's width and height, expansion along its length, stretching of the cranial base and face, reduced frontal width, fronto-malar and biorbitary elongation of the face and further development of foramen magnum. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Artificial cranial deformation effects; Biology and culture",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956136090

However, several previous studies have also clarified some morphological facial traits discernible between the early-modern Okinawans and the Jomon of Honshu. In the present study, to further evaluate the Jomon-Okinawan relationship, we compared facial forms between skeletal samples from the Okinawa islands and Honshu, both in the Jomon and early-modern periods. Results of the comparisons showed that the Okinawa Jomon tended to possess a flatter interorbital region than the Honshu Jomon, but most measurements did not significantly differ between the two Jomon groups. This confirms that people sharing both Jomon culture and fundamental facial features lived throughout almost the entire Japanese archipelago, including the Okinawa islands. Results also demonstrated that the early-modern Okinawans had a significantly lower and broader face with transversely broader and flatter interorbital region than the early-modern Honshu Japanese. Such facial characteristics of the early-modern Okinawans qualitatively matched those of the Okinawa Jomon. However, compared with the Okinawa Jomon, the early-modern Okinawans exhibited an absolutely taller/narrower face and a further flatter nasal root. This could stem in part from a certain amount of population flow from surrounding regions during historic periods, as suggested by many earlier studies. Nevertheless, the results obtained in this study indicate that, comparatively, modern Okinawan people have retained physical traits including facial forms of the Jomon who survived in the same southernmost islands of the Japanese archipelago. Geographical variations of modern Japanese phenotypes should also be accounted for partly by those of the ancestral Jomon characteristics that were manifested by the end of the Jomon period. © 2011 The Anthropological Society of Nippon.","Facial flatness; Japanese population history; Jomon; Ryukyu",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860212660

They expanded rapidly along the northeastern coast of Hokkaido. We reconstructed infant feeding practices of the Moyoro population of the Okhotsk culture in eastern Hokkaido, Japan. Methods: Stable isotope ratios in 58 subadult human skeletons were measured. Results: The results suggest that complementary foods with a relatively low carbon isotope ratio were consumed during and after weaning, as observed in ethnographic descriptions of northern human populations such as the Ainu and isotopically suggested in ancient northern hunter-gatherer-fisher populations. Nitrogen isotope ratios of subadults showed that the age at the end of weaning in the Moyoro population was 1.8 (1.4-2.2 in 95% credible interval) years, which is earlier than that in other northern hunter-gatherer-fisher populations. Conclusions: Because weaning age is one of the most important determinants of fertility, a shorter breastfeeding period suggests increased fertility. Furthermore, better nutrition would further promote the population increase, and thus populations of the Okhotsk culture could expand into new regions. These findings are consistent with recent emerging evidence of great contributions of the Okhotsk to the formation of later Ainu populations and culture. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","breastfeeding; complementary food; fertility; Hokkaido; hunter-gatherer-fisher","carbon 13; nitrogen 15; carbon; nitrogen; adolescent; Article; breast feeding; child; collagen metabolism; cultural factor; fertility; human; human tissue; infant feeding; isotope analysis; Japanese (people); Moyoro population; population dynamics; preschool child; school child; subadult; weaning; chemistry; ethnology; female; history; infant; Japan; male; newborn; rib; skull; weaning; Adolescent; Breast Feeding; Carbon Isotopes; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Fertility; History, Medieval; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Nitrogen Isotopes; Ribs; Skull; Weaning",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946763368

This study using three-dimensional (3D) images aimed to identify more detailed characteristics of facial morphology in each population. Methods: Using a hand-held 3D scanner, we obtained 60 facial surface images each from Okinawa Islanders and mainland Japanese. Twenty-one landmarks were plotted on a computer and 27 measurements of distances and angles between the landmarks were taken. Statistical analyses such as t test, principal component analysis (PCA), regression analysis, and discriminant analysis were performed to identify sex and regional differences, the patterns of facial features, factors explaining the facial patterns, and other features. Results: Okinawa Islanders showed lower facial and nasal heights than mainland Japanese. Furthermore, we identified larger protrusions of the glabella and nasal root in Okinawa Islanders than in mainland Japanese. In the PCA, we observed components of facial shape patterns. These components mainly represented facial size (PC1), facial depth (PC2), the prominence of the glabella and nasal root (PC3), and facial breadth (PC4). We identified that the population difference is strongly associated with PC3. Conclusions: This study quantitatively identified differences in the facial morphology between Okinawa Islanders and mainland Japanese using 3D digital images, with special emphases on the differences in the nasal height and the prominence of the glabella and nasal root.

Variations among regions and correlations between latitude and respective measurements and indices were calculated and a principal component analysis was conducted to elucidate human limb bone characteristics. Significant correlation and marginally significant correlation were found for the maximum subtrochanteric diameter (r = 0.662, P = 0.027) and the platymeric index (r = -0.583, P = 0.060) with latitude, respectively, suggesting that the femur of northern Asians had a wide and flat subtrochanteric shape. The second principal component of the principal component analysis shows that the northeastern samples with comparatively long shaft length and thin and flat shaft diameters were discriminated from the southern samples; the second principal component was significantly correlated with latitude (r = -0.743, P = 0.009). The estimated Fst value of 0.432-0.336 shows that the variation in limb bone measurements across regions is rather large, at approximately two or three times the low levels of interregional variation (0.078-0.180) in analyses of cranial and dental data.

To evaluate potential relationships between the symphyseal shape and teeth further, the growth patterns of the symphyseal region and the positioning of the tooth crypts were examined using CT data, comparing four primate species (modern humans, chimpanzees, Japanese monkeys, and hamadryas baboons) with varied symphyseal curvature and tooth size. First, results showed that interspecies differences in overall mandibular shape including symphyseal inclination and bicanine width are consistently expressed throughout postnatal ontogeny, although local symphyseal configurations related to the superior transverse torus (STT) tended to change considerably during growth in chimpanzees. Second, the four species were found to exhibit differentiated formation positions of the incisor and canine crypts. In particular, I2 developed between I1 and C in humans with a broad bicanine space and small teeth, whereas it was positioned posterior to I1 and above C in the cercopithecines with an extremely narrow bicanine space. In chimpanzees, despite the large bicanine width, I1 and I2 grew with a large antero-posterior overlap owing to their large size. These results indicate that the dental positioning is determined in concert with the size balance of the available mandibular space and forming teeth. Finally, the positions/contours of I2 crypt were shown to correspond strongly with the STT across the taxa. This suggests that interspecies differences in symphyseal shape should be interpreted partially by the species-specific positional relationships of the developing anterior teeth.

In the present study, we evaluated patterns of variation in external and internal craniofacial morphologies among four phylogenetic groups of extant macaques (the fascicularis, sinica, silenus, and sylvanus groups), using computed tomography and multivariate analyses. We also reassessed the holotype of M.anderssoni, a partial cranium preserving the face and palate, to evaluate the phylogenetic group to which M.anderssoni is most closely related. Facial elongation was found to be significantly influenced by size. The particular combination of some allometric and non-allometric shape components was found to reflect phylogenetic relationships; however, these features of M.anderssoni fall intermediate among the four phylogenetic groups, with no typical similarities to any one group. The variations in nasal cavity shape were found to reflect phylogenetic relationships but those of the maxillary sinus did not. Macacaanderssoni has a nasal cavity that is laterally expanded anteriorly and constricted posteriorly, a unique morphology among macaques and shared only with larger members of the sinica group. This unique feature is considered to be a derived condition among macaques, suggesting that M.anderssoni is phylogenetically related to the sinica group (especially M.assamensis, M.thibetana, and M. arctoides) and that the populations of the sinica group were distributed in northern China during the Early Pleistocene. Currently, the populations of the sinica group are not distributed in northern East Asia, while those of the fascicularis group are. Thus, probably due to climatic deterioration in the Late Pleistocene, the former lineage has retreated southward or has become extinct in this region, being replaced by the latter lineage. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","East Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Maxillary sinus; Nasal cavity; Phylogenetic signal; Quaternary","biogeography; cranium; fossil; geometry; morphology; morphometry; phylogenetics; Pleistocene; primate; tomography; China; Henan; Macaca; Macaca arctoides; anatomy and histology; animal; China; computer assisted tomography; demography; ecosystem; evolution; face; fossil; Macaca; radiography; Animals; Biological Evolution; China; Demography; Ecosystem; Face; Fossils; Macaca; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902331771

The main aim of this research was to determine if there was any relationship between the shape of the nose as expressed in terms of nasal height and width (nasal index) and total nasal airway resistance (NAR), as one would predict that the narrower leptorrhine noses would have a greater resistance to air flow than the broader platyrrhine noses. It was also proposed that the narrow leptorrhine nose would have better developed vascular tissue than the broad platyrrhine nose in order to condition cold air, and would exhibit a greater response to nasal decongestion. No correlation was found between nasal index and NAR (r = -0.09) and similarly no correlation was found between nasal index and response to a topical nasal decongestant (r = 0.02). The absence of any physiological differences between the different nose types may be due to acclimatisation of participants to the area of recruitment.","Nasal airway resistance; Nasal decongestant; Nasal index; Rhinomanometry","decongestive agent; acclimatization; adolescent; adult; airway resistance; article; case report; drug effect; female; histology; human; male; middle aged; nose; patient selection; physiology; pilot study; rhinomanometry; treatment outcome; Acclimatization; Adolescent; Adult; Airway Resistance; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Decongestants; Nose; Patient Selection; Pilot Projects; Rhinomanometry; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856562803
