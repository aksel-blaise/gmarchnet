As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Canonical variate analysis; Linear discriminant function; Ordination; Principal component analysis; Procrustes; Selection gradient",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952312407

When too few landmarks are available, outlines can be digitized as series of discrete points. The individual points must be slid along a tangential direction so as to remove tangential variation, because contours should be homologous from subject to subject whereas their individual points need not. This variation can be removed by minimizing either bending energy (BE) or Procrustes distance (D) with respect to a mean reference form. Because these two criteria make different assumptions, it becomes necessary to study how these differences modify the results obtained. We performed bootstrapped-based Goodall's F-test, Foote's measurement, principal component (PC) and discriminant function analyses on human molars and craniometric data to compare the results obtained by the two criteria. Results show that: (1) F-scores and P-values were similar for both criteria; (2) results of Foote's measurement show that both criteria yield different estimates of within- and between-sample variation; (3) there is low correlation between the first PC axes obtained by D and BE; (4) the percentage of correct classification is similar for BE and D, but the ordination of groups along discriminant scores differs between them. The differences between criteria can alter the results when morphological variation in the sample is small, as in the analysis of modern human populations. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation. © 2006 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Dental and facial data; Minimum bending energy; Minimum Procrustes distance","accuracy; anthropometric parameters; article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; correlation analysis; craniofacial morphology; functional assessment; geometry; human; intermethod comparison; molar tooth; priority journal; reference value; scoring system; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Dentition; Facial Bones; Humans; Male; Models, Anatomic; Molar",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744472832

There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups. We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15 with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5 h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed from the unexposed in this sample.

This methodological paper examines approaches to optimizing the classification of specimens based on their outlines. This study examines the performance of four approaches to the mathematical representation of outlines and two different approaches to curve measurement as applied to a collection of feather outlines. A new approach to the dimension reduction necessary to carry out a CVA on this type of outline data with modest sample sizes is also presented, and its performance is compared to two other approaches to dimension reduction. Results: Two semi-landmark-based methods, bending energy alignment and perpendicular projection, are shown to produce roughly equal rates of classification, as do elliptical Fourier methods and the extended eigenshape method of outline measurement. Rates of classification were not highly dependent on the number of points used to represent a curve or the manner in which those points were acquired. The new approach to dimensionality reduction, which utilizes a variable number of principal component (PC) axes, produced higher cross-validation assignment rates than either the standard approach of using a fixed number of PC axes or a partial least squares method. Conclusion: Classification of specimens based on feather shape was not highly dependent of the details of the method used to capture shape information. The choice of dimensionality reduction approach was more of a factor, and the cross validation rate of assignment may be optimized using the variable number of PC axes method presented herein. © 2006 Sheets et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749530871

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

In Morocco, very few studies are specifically dedicated to small fossil vertebrates, and neither taphonomic nor palaeoecological studies have been undertaken on these taxa, particularly in archaeological contexts. The late Pleistocene to middle Holocene succession of El Harhoura 2 cave, situated in the region of Témara, yields an exceptionally rich small vertebrate assemblage. We present the results of a first systematic, taphonomic, and palaeoecological study of the small mammals from Levels 1 to 8 of El Harhoura 2. The absence of bone sorting and polishing, as well as the presence of significant traces of digestion indicate that the small mammal bones were accumulated in the cave by predators and that no water transport occurred. Other traces observed on the surface of bones consist mainly of root marks and black traces (micro-organisms or more probably manganese) which affected the majority of the material. The percentage of fragmentation is very high in all stratigraphic levels, and the post-depositional breakage (geologic and anthropogenic phenomena) obscure the original breakage patterns of bones by predators. According to the ecology of the different species present in the levels of El Harhoura 2, and by taking into account possible biases highlighted by the taphonomic analysis, we reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental evolution in the region. For quantitative reconstructions we used two indices: the Taxonomic Habitat Index (THI) and the Gerbillinae/Murinae ratio. Late Pleistocene accumulations were characterised by a succession of humid (Levels 3, 4a, 6, and 8) and arid (Levels 2?, 5, and 7) periods, with more or less open landscapes, ending in an ultimate humid and wooded period during the middle Holocene (Level 1). We discuss particular limits of our results and interpretations, due to an important lack of taxonomic, ecological, and taphonomic knowledge in North Africa. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","El Harhoura 2; Late Quaternary; North-Atlantic Morocco; Palaeoecology; Small mammals; Taphonomy","archaeological evidence; cave deposit; climate variation; depocenter; fossil assemblage; fossil record; Holocene; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; paleontology; Pleistocene; small mammal; taphonomy; taxonomy; Morocco; Rabat; Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer; Temara; Homo sapiens; Mammalia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649451520

We studied within-individual developmental variation (fluctuating asymmetry) in the mandible of four shrew species raised under normal and extreme environments. Patterns of among-individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry were strongly concordant in traits that were involved in the attachment of the same muscles (i.e., functionally integrated traits), and fluctuating asymmetry was closely integrated among these traits, implying direct developmental interactions among traits involved in the same function. Stress-induced variation was largely confined to the directions delimited by functionally integrated groups of traits in the pattern that was concordant with species divergence - species differed most in the same traits that were most sensitive to stress within each species. These results reveal a strong effect of functional complexes on directing and incorporating stress-induced variation during development and might explain the historical persistence of sets of traits involved in the same function in shrew jaws despite their high sensitivity to environmental variation.","Developmental plasticity; Modularity; Morphological integration; Sorex shrews; Stress; Variation","functional morphology; animal; article; biometry; diet; environment; evolution; female; histology; male; mandible; mastication; mechanical stress; physiology; shrew; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biometry; Diet; Environment; Evolution; Female; Male; Mandible; Mastication; Shrews; Stress, Mechanical; Sorex; Soricidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042810120

The central assumption underlying this expectation is that taxa experiencing similar selection have similar response to that selection. However, because selection acts on trait function, taxa similarity in selection response depends crucially on the relationship between function and morphology. Further, when a trait consists of multiple parts, changes in function in response to selection can result from modification of different parts, and adaptation to the same environment might result in functional but not morphological similarity. Here, we address the extent to which functional and morphological diversity in masticatory apparatus of soricid shrews reflects a shared ecological characteristic of their diet type. We examine the factors limiting morphological variation across shrew species by assessing the relative contribution of trait function (biomechanics of the jaw), ecology, and phylogeny to species similarity in mandibular traits. We found that species that shared diet type were functionally but not morphologically similar. The presence of multiple semi-independently varying traits enabled functional equivalence of composite foraging morphologies and resulted in variable response to selection exerted by similar diet. We show that functional equivalence of multiple morphologies enabled persistence of differences in habitat use (e.g., habitat moisture and coverage) among species that specialize on the same diet. We discuss the importance of developmental and functional integration among traits for evolutionary diversification of morphological structures that generate equivalent functions. © 2007 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Biomechanics; Mandible; Morphological integration; Redundancy; Sorex","adaptation; biodiversity; biomechanics; diet; functional morphology; habitat use; phylogeny; selection; small mammal; animal; article; biological model; biomechanics; ecosystem; evolution; histology; mandible; phylogeny; species difference; Animals; Biomechanics; Ecosystem; Evolution; Mandible; Models, Biological; Phylogeny; Species Specificity; Sorex; Soricidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-35748935526

We based this appreciation upon the detailed morphology of the distal part of the metapodials. Landmark approaches were applied to archaeological and palaeontological samples from three distinct areas: Switzerland Plateau, Paris Basin, and Charente (France). Little differences of isometric size characterized the three regional samples. Multivariate analyses of shape (principal component analysis, discriminant, canonical variates and neural network analyses) revealed similar sets of complex shape features on both metacarpals and metatarsals. In addition, regional groups appeared clearly differentiated by well defined shape patterns, the functional implications of which remain to be established. These results evidence the existence of a regional structuration of populations (particularly clear on the CVA of both metacarpals and metatarsals) suggesting the absence of long distance migrations. Finally, it appears that the distinction between size and shape systematically operated by geometric morphometrics can provide better insights into the study of the mobility of ancient populations. Geometric morphometrics approaches such as 3D Procrustes superimpositions, appear therefore to be of great interest for archaeological purposes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested this model using the dental phenotype of modern and ancient common voles (Microtus arvalis), introduced onto the Orkney archipelago (Scotland) from continental Europe some 5000 years ago. First, we investigated phenotypic divergence of Orkney and continental European populations and assessed climatic influences. Second, phenotypic differentiation among Orkney populations was tested against geography, time, and neutral genetic patterns. Finally, we examined evolutionary change along a time series for the Orkney Mainland. Molar gigantism and anterior-lobe hypertrophy evolved rapidly in Orkney voles following introduction, without any transitional forms detected. Founder events and adaptation appear to explain this initial rapid evolution. Idiosyncrasy in dental features among different island populations of Orkney voles is also likely the result of local founder events following Neolithic translocation around the archipelago. However, against our initial expectations, a second marked phenotypic shift occurred between the 4th and 12th centuries AD, associated with increased pastoral farming and introduction of competitors (mice and rats) and terrestrial predators (foxes and cats). These results indicate that human agency can generate a more complex pattern of morphological evolution than might be expected in island rodents. © 2014 The Authors.","Dispersal; Evolutionary rate; Geometric morphometrics; Island evolution; Tooth shape; Zooarchaeology","adaptation; divergence; ecological modeling; geometry; morphology; morphometry; Neolithic; population structure; rodent; Europe; Mainland [Shetland]; Scotland; Shetland; United Kingdom; Microtus arvalis orcadensis; Muridae; adaptation; anatomy and histology; animal; Arvicolinae; biological model; climate; ecosystem; Europe; founder effect; genetic variability; genetics; island (geological); molar tooth; molecular evolution; phenotype; population genetics; United Kingdom; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Arvicolinae; Climate; Ecosystem; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Founder Effect; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Islands; Models, Genetic; Molar; Phenotype; Scotland",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908068182

Although modularity of the mandible and skull has been studied extensively in mammals, few studies have explored shape co-variation between these two structures. Despite being developmentally independent, the skull and mandible form a functionally integrated unit. In the present paper we use 3D surface geometric morphometric methods allowing us to explore the form of both skull and mandible in its 3D complexity using the greater white-toothed shrew as a model. This approach allows an accurate 3D description of zones devoid of anatomical landmarks that are functionally important. Two-block partial least-squares approaches were used to describe the co-variation of form between skull and mandible. Moreover, a 3D biomechanical model was used to explore the functional consequences of the observed patterns of co-variation. Our results show the efficiency of the method in investigations of complex morpho-functional patterns. Indeed, the description of shape co-variation between the skull and the mandible highlighted the location and the intensity of their functional relationships through the jaw adductor muscles linking these two structures. Our results also demonstrated that shape co-variation in form between the skull and mandible has direct functional consequences on the recruitment of muscles during biting. © 2013 Anatomical Society.","Biting; Geometric morphometrics; Muscle; Shrews; Surface shape","anatomical variation; animal experiment; article; biomechanics; bite; functional anatomy; geometry; jaw adductor muscle; jaw movement; jaw muscle; mandible; molar tooth; morphometrics; nonhuman; priority journal; skull; three dimensional imaging; tooth; Crocidura; Mammalia; Soricidae; biting; geometric morphometrics; muscle; shrews; surface shape; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mandible; Mastication; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological; Shrews; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884207131

A side effect of these human movements was the involuntary dispersion of commensal species, such as the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus). One archaeological layer dated from the 4th Century BC, coming from an Iberian village located in the Mediterranean coast of Spain, contained a large and reliable accumulation of small mammals. The presence of the house mouse was highly suspected within this layer. To assess its abundance quantitatively, we used a geometric morphometrics approach of the first lower molar contour using elliptical Fourier analysis. We also increased the power of the discrimination between the Algerian mouse (Mus spretus) and the house mouse by combining a dimension reduction approach together with different validation procedures. The relative importance of age, sex, and geographical origin onto the shape and form of the lower molar contour was also investigated. The results obtained demonstrate the presence and the dominance of the house mouse in the landscape surrounding the Iberian village in the 1st Millennium BC, only a few centuries after its arrival in the Western Mediterranean Basin. A cross-validated linear discriminant function considering different Mediterranean populations suggest Morocco and France as the most probable geographical origins for the Algerian mouse, and Tunisia for the origin of house mice in North-Eastern Spain. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.","Catalonia; Colonization; Elliptical Fourier analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus spretus","abundance; archaeological evidence; colonization; dominance; Fourier transform; geometry; human evolution; Iron Age; morphometry; rodent; France; Mediterranean Coast [Spain]; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (West); Morocco; Spain; Mammalia; Mus musculus; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus spretus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751469607

This genus is used as a major biostratigraphic tool within the Quaternary. Specific determinations using the Schmelzband-Differenzierung-Quotient or SDQ have identified many chronospecies within the fossil species Arvicola cantiana (Hinton, 1910). As SDQ calculation remains limited, this study reappraises the Arvicola genus in terms of morphodiversity and morphospace using outline analysis which takes into account the tooth as a whole. Outline analysis suggests that one single species of Arvicola, A. cantiana, was present during the Pleistocene. This species shows great variability with no trends or patterns in morphospace. Thus, these results call into question the reliability of SDQ for specific determinations and throw doubt on the biochronological framework based on Arvicola. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In southern France this cereal is common in carbonized contexts such as cultural layers, ditches, pits, hearths, etc. The distinction between the two subspecies, two-rowed (. Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L.) and six-rowed barley (. H.vulgare subsp. vulgare L.) is usually based on morphological characters. The following criteria can be used to discriminate both subspecies from archaeological remains: the number of fertile spikelets per rachis segments, the linear or horseshoe shape depression of the lemma base, the maximum width of the caryopses and the proportion of twisted grains. The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for two-rowed barley is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of two-rowed barley in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1st to the 11th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Archaeobotany; Cereal grains; Experimental charring; Identification; Medieval period; Roman period","agricultural history; archaeological evidence; archaeology; barley; cultivation; experimental study; identification method; Medieval; morphometry; Roman era; agriculture; botany; cereal; France; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886302631

Cervids are often the most abundant taxon in Eurasian Plio-Pleistocene sites, yet their post-cranial remains are rarely utilized in paleoecological reconstructions. Cervids are found in a wide variety of habitats, and thus their ecomorphology spans an appropriate range to serve as a proxy for paleohabitat. Four morphological features are examined in this study; the calcaneus as a whole (n=122), the medial margin of the patellar surface of the femur (n=133), the lateral margin of the tibial plateau (n=136), and the plantar margin of the third phalanx (n=62). These features were chosen because they represent various aspects of cervid locomotion important for power generation, stability, and substrate interaction. For each feature, canonical variates analyses with cross-validations were used to assess how well landmark configurations distinguish among specimens from different habitat types. Cross-validations returned correct reclassifications rates ranging from 38.9% to 66.3% in a four-habitat system, with resubstitution rates of 55.4% to 79.1% correct.

The opportunity to document the colonization history of both men and mice in Transcaucasia was made possible by the discovery of mouse remains accumulated in pits from a 6000-year-old farming village in the Nakhchivan (Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan). The present study investigated their taxonomy and most likely dispersal path through the identification of the Mus lineage to which they might belong using a geometric morphometric approach of dental traits distances between archaeological and modern populations of the different Mus lineages of South-West Asia. We demonstrate that the mouse remains trapped in the deep storage pits of the dwelling belong to the Mus musculus domesticus from the Near East, with dental shapes similar to current populations in Northern Syria. These results strongly suggest that the domesticus lineage was dispersed into Transcaucasia from the upper Euphrates valley by Neolithic migration, some time between the 7th and 5th millennium BC, providing substantial evidence to back up the scenario featuring near-eastern stimuli in the emergence of agriculture in the South Caucasus. The domesticus mitochondrial DNA signature of the current house mouse in the same location 5000 years later, as well as their turnover towards a subspecies musculus/castaneus phenotype, suggests that early domesticus colonizers hybridized with a later musculus (and maybe castaneus) dispersal originating from south of the Caspian Sea and/or Northern Caucasia. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.","Colonization history; Geometric morphometric; House mouse; Hybridization; Mus musculus","archaeology; bioaccumulation; colonization; dispersal; genetic analysis; geometry; hybrid; hybridization; identification method; mitochondrial DNA; morphometry; Neolithic; population structure; rodent; taxonomy; Azerbaijan; Caspian Sea; Syrian Arab Republic",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875069212

Species confined between various barriers (Atlas Mountains, arid environments such as the Sahara in the south, water masses such as the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west) were generally forced to adapt locally to environmental changes instead of tracking their habitat by shifting their distribution area. The present study aims at providing first insight into the evolution of the genus Mus, and more specifically of the western Mediterranean species Mus spretus in this area. The study relies on the abundant Late Pleistocene and Middle Holocene fossil assemblage from the El Harhoura 2 cave (Rabat-Témara, Morocco). This exceptional record was studied using geometric morphometrics applied to first upper and lower molars, constituting the most informative and best preserved fossil remains for such small rodents. Two main issues were addressed. (1) Geometric morphometrics was used to clarify taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships among fossil and modern species in this area. Morphometric analysis revealed good discrimination of most modern and fossil species but failed to document intermediate forms tracing anagenetic evolution. Not mutually exclusive, the occurrence of complex processes of morphological evolution in this genus such as parallel evolution and the action of stabilizing selection may make it difficult to translate patterns of morphological evolution into phylogenetic conclusions. (2) The record was shown to document a sequence of intraspecific evolution of M.spretus. The morphology of the molars through the fossil record of El Harhoura 2 was surprisingly stable despite extensive modern variation. The limited temporal variation largely failed to correlate to palaeoenvironmental proxies. The mouse fossil record at El Harhoura 2 thus presents an intriguing case of morphological stasis despite extensive environmental changes. This long-term stability may have been recently perturbed by anthropogenic factors including landscape changes and introduction of various competitors and predators, leading to a size reduction.© 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 599-621. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.","Elliptic Fourier Analysis of outlines; First upper and lower molars; Geometric morphometrics; Holocene; Morocco; Murinae, Rodentia; Pleistocene","anthropogenic effect; arid environment; biogeographical region; fossil assemblage; fossil record; geometry; Holocene; immigration; morphology; morphometry; paleoenvironment; phylogenetics; phylogeny; Pleistocene; rodent; tropical region; Atlantic Ocean; Atlas Mountains; Mediterranean Sea; Morocco; Sahara; Murinae; Mus spretus; Rodentia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879267101

Consequently, islands have been key model systems in our understanding of evolutionary theory. The greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) is of interest as it has invaded French Atlantic islands within the last few thousand years and is considered to be morphologically and genetically stable in this area. In this article, we study the shape of the mandible of the greater white-toothed shrew on four islands and compare it with that of individuals from populations on the mainland to quantify the effects of insularity. The degree of insularity (i.e. island size and distance to the continent) is thought to be linked to differences in ecological characteristics of islands compared with the mainland. We used geometric morphometric analyses to quantify differences in size and shape between populations and employed a simple biomechanical model to evaluate the potential effects of shape differences on bite force. Specimens from island populations are different from continental populations in shape and mechanical potential of the mandible. Among islands, the mandible shows various shapes that are correlated with both the distance from the coast and island area. The shape differences are located on different parts of the mandible, suggesting different ecological constraints on each island. Moreover, these shapes are linked to the 'mechanical potential', which is markedly different between islands. Mechanical potential has been suggested to evolve in response to prey size and or mechanical properties. In conclusion, our results show that, in spite of the relatively recent colonization of the Atlantic Islands, the mandible of C.russula possesses a distinct shape. Moreover, the shape differs among islands and is probably linked to the consumption of different prey. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","Bite force; Mandible; Morphometrics; Shape","biomechanics; colonization; evolutionary theory; functional change; morphology; morphometry; prey size; rodent; specimen bank; tooth; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; France; Crocidura; Crocidura russula; Russula",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866326784

Secondly, these analyses show that the rodent faunas from Laetoli, Hadar, Omo Member B and F (Ethiopia) and Olduvai Bed I (Tanzania), all of which are situated in the Rift Valley, are clearly distinct assemblages. Each fauna is characterized by a strong endemism and seems to have evolved independently.

It provides not only palaeoenvironmental data, but also further information about other studies such as morphometrics, ancient DNA and zoogeography. This article focuses on the ecological data, and attempts to develop an accurate taphonomic study to assess the reliability and statistical significance of this archaeological sample. The species encountered include the short-tailed mouse (Mus spretus), the Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae), the lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens), the white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula), the field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), and the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus). The presence of the commensal house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) is suspected. In addition, the absence of black rat (Rattus rattus) suggests that this species had not yet colonised the Iberian coast at that time. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the ability to gain access to resources not available to other individuals and species should be under strong selection. In the present study, we focus on the potential role of biting in a shrew (Crocidura russula) because this trait may confer two advantages: (1) a broadening of the dietary niche and (2) the provision of direct superiority in interspecific interactions. The model chosen is the greater white-toothed shrew, which is considered as invasive in northern Europe and which is also known to displace native species of shrew in this area. Moreover, its distribution appears to constrain the distributional ranges of other species of shrew in the Maghreb. We use geometric morphometrics and a simple biomechanical model to describe shape variation and to evaluate the mechanical potential of the mandible of ten species of white-toothed shrews, with a special emphasis on C. russula and Crocidura suaveolens. We find that C. russula possesses an intermediate mechanical potential linked with an intermediate level of shape variability. Our results suggest that the higher mechanical potential may explain the observed pattern of colonization of the Atlantic islands by C. russula at the expense of C.suaveolens. Finally, our results also suggest that the ability to bite hard may be under strong selection in shrews. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.","Crocidura; Feeding system; Islands; Mammals; Mechanical potential; Shape","biomechanics; colonization; life history trait; morphometry; native species; natural selection; niche breadth; rodent; shape; Atlantic islands; Maghreb; Crocidura; Crocidura russula; Crocidura suaveolens; Mammalia; Soricidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924540595

Here we report field data from the successful trapping of five specimens of C. tarfayaensis in the Guelmim region. The habitat was characterized by sand dunes along a river, with dense shrubberies of Tamarix sp., the huge grass Erianthus ravennae (Poaceae) and flat bushes of Atriplex glauca var. ifniensis (Chenopodiaceae). Morphological discrimination with C. whitakeri were examined. The chromosomes of C. tarfayaensis revealed a karyotype of 2n = 36, similar to that of the Canary shrew C. canariensis and the Sicilian shrew C. sicula.

Specimens of C. suaveolens and C. leucodon from mainland Italy and of C. russula from Sardinia were used as reference in this analysis. The biometry of the only taxon of shrews living in Sicily is significantly different from the three reference samples. This result, coupled with a recently discovered new karyotype, provides strong evidence for a new Eurasian species, for which the name C. sicula Miller 1901, was chosen. Crocidura species living in the Egadi archipelago (Levanzo, Ma- rettimo and Favignana), and on Ustica and Gozo, are biometrically grouped together. They also differ significantly from the Sicilian species and from the reference samples. However, the Gozo and Sicilian specimens share the same karyotype and both populations are biochemically very similar. The status of these taxa should be provisionally related to C. cf. sicula. The independent divergence of insular populations is one of the recorded patterns of geographic variation and could explain these findings. As regards the independent taxon from Pantelleria, there is evidence of the presence on the island of a C. cf. russula, probably coming from North Africa. The pattern of other vertebrate and invertebrate colonization of this island is, in fact, influenced by the African continent. The presence of Crocidura on Ustica and Lampedusa was not known until now. The mandible fragments found in Lampedusa are insufficient to perform a multivariate analysis, allowing only a rough morphological study. This taxon was also preliminarily related to C. cf. sicula. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009508845

Instead of using qualitative and descriptive characters, morphometric methods provide now a general quantitative description of shape. Applying these new morphometric methods (outline analysis), we demonstrate that lower as well as upper molars are useful and efficient for palaeontological analyses within voles (Arvicolinae). Herein it is made evident that except the first lower molars, the use of all the other molars allows the improvement of specific determinations.

We apply taphonomic and ecological approaches to analyzing an assemblage of microvertebrate remains from the Iron Age IIA of Tel Megiddo, Israel. Sampling in a dense residential area including house floors and various fills produced 1080 identifiable specimens including fish, mammal, reptile and bird remains. The mammalian remains show a number of distinct patterns pointing to accumulation from the community of small animals which lived and died on-site. These patterns include evidence for fragmentation due to trampling and presence of burned specimens. The mammalian remains also differed in their taphonomy from an assemblage from Early Bronze Age II Megiddo which originated from predator accumulation during a period of abandonment. These analyses point to an especially low taxonomic diversity in the Iron Age residential assemblage suggesting that the urban environment of Megiddo supported a unique community of small mammalian animals. This differs markedly from ecological conditions in modern day cities which in some cases show greater than background levels of diversity and suggests a dense, homogenous urban environment. We suggest that reconstructing the evolution of urban fauna in greater detail will provide a sensitive tool for tracing historical processes of growth, decline and increasing complexity of urban sites in the Near East as well as other regions of the world. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ancient bio-indicators; Iron Age; Microvertebrate taphonomy; Near East; Tel Megiddo; Urban ecology","bioindicator; community ecology; fossil assemblage; identification key; invertebrate; Iron Age; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; species diversity; taphonomy; urban ecosystem; Israel; Megiddo; Northern District; Animalia; Aves; Mammalia; Reptilia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867919251
