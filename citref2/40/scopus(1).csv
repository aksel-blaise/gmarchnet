For interpolation of a surface over a fixed set of nodes in the plane, the bending energy is a quadratic form in the heights assigned to the surface. The spline is the superposition of eigenvectors of the bending energy matrix, of successively larger physical scales, over a tilted flat plane having no bending energy at all. When these splines are paired, one representing the x-coordinate of another form and the other the y-coordinate, they aid greatly in the modeling of biological shape change as deformation. In this context, the pair becomes an interpolation map from R2 to R2 relating two sets of landmark points. The spline maps decompose, in the same way as the spline surfaces, into a linear part (an affine transformation) together with the superposition of principal warps, which are geometrically independent, affine-free deformations of progressively smaller geometrical scales. The warps decompose an empirical deformation into orthogonal features more or less as a conventional orthogonal functional analysis decomposes the single scene. This paper demonstrates the decomposition of deformations by principal warps, extends the method to deal with curving edges between landmarks, relates this formalism to other applications of splines current in computer vision, and indicates how they might aid in the extraction of features for analysis, comparison, and diagnosis of biological and medical images. © 1989 IEEE","Affine transformations; biharmonic equation; biomedical image analysis; deformation; principal warps; quadratic variation; shape; thin-plate splines; warping",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957563017

For this reason, studies focusing on purported early hominid hunting and butchery sites are important if rigorous criteria for recognizing such sites are used. Different criteria currently used as evidence of hominid involvement with ancient bones are reviewed and it is concluded that the presence of cutmarks, verified by scanning electron microscope (SEM) inspection, is the most reliable. Successful application of this criterion depends upon a thorough knowledge of the normal variations in microscopic morphology of different types of marks that are found on bones. Therefore, variations in microscopic and gross morphology within and among a large sample of known stone tool cutmarks, carnivore tooth scratches, and rodent gnawing marks are documented. The effects of sedimentary abrasion, as caused by fluvial transport of bones, are also presented. Guidelines are presented for using microscopic criteria to identify unknown marks on fossils and possible applications of this approach are discussed. Further, it is suggested that evidence of hominid carcass-processing activities can be placed into one of three ranked categories of certainty according to the type of data used. Explicitly stating the category and type of evidence used to deduce hominid activities, and by extension to define site types (i.e., butchery, kill, base camp), may improve the clarity of hypotheses about and interpretations of early hominid behaviors. © 1983.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002170703

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption. We consider the implications of these findings in terms of the potential for these approaches in the study of comparative growth in related species.","Facial remodelling; Geometric morphometrics; Thin plate spline analysis","age; allometry; article; cercocebus; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; face growth; female; geometry; male; molar tooth; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; sex difference; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Anthropometry; Bone Remodeling; Cercocebus; Facial Bones; Female; Male; Models, Anatomic; Sex Characteristics; Cercocebus; Cercocebus torquatus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031724058

The experimental background applied to differentiate both types of marks has been rather limited and authors have sometimes reached conflicting conclusions. This is partly due to methodological reasons: some authors have used very high magnification to examine microscopic features, whereas others have relied on more reduced magnification. Likewise, some experiments have exposed bones to trampling for reduced periods (minutes) whereas others have used longer time periods (hours). The present study stresses that the use of a scanning electronic microscope is not practical for identifying the impact of butchery and trampling marks in complete bone assemblages. It also emphasizes that previous studies have not addressed all the possible variables that could potentially be used to discriminate these marks, nor have they quantified the morphological patterns of each type of mark. Here we present a multivariate analysis of more than a dozen variables and show that butchery and trampling marks have very distinctive microscopic morphology. We advocate the use of a low magnification approach (≤40×), which can enable the analysis of complete assemblages using either hand lenses or binocular lenses. We also show the morphological criteria that differentiate butchery cut marks made with simple and retouched tools. We show that whereas complete discrimination of marks is impossible due to some degree of overlap, the list of criteria derived through multivariate analyses can be confidently used to correctly differentiate butchery and trampling marks in more than 90% of cases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

There are many analytical methods proposed for checking multivariate normality. However, deciding which method to use is a challenging process, since each method may give different results under certain conditions. Hence, we may say that there is no best method, which is valid under any condition, for normality checking. In addition to numerical results, it is very useful to use graphical methods to decide on multivariate normality. Combining the numerical results from several methods with graphical approaches can be useful and provide more reliable decisions. Here, we present an R package, MVN, to assess multivariate normality.

In particular, meat-eating and bone marrow consumption are often presented as either complementary or opposing strategies of carcass exploitation. The presence of cut marks on fossil archeofauna is a potential source of information that has not been consistently used as evidence of carcass consumption by hominids. Some authors interpret cut marks as the result of hominids manipulating meat-bearing bones, while others argue that they can also be the result of hominids extracting marginal scraps of carcass flesh that have survived carnivores' initial consumption. In this study, a referential framework concerning the interpretation of cut marks is pre-sented, based on a set of experiments conducted by the author. It is suggested, according to these experiments and data drawn from the FLK ""Zinj"" site, that hominids processed meat-bearing bones (on which flesh was abundant) rather than defleshed carcasses from felid kills. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Cut marks; Lions; Meat-eating; Mid-shafts; Olduvai; Plio-pleistocene sites; Proximal/distal shafts; Upper/lower limb bones","Felidae; Hominidae; Panthera leo; Animalia; Felidae; Hominidae; Mammalia; Primates; diet; hominid; meat eating; Pleistocene; Pliocene; animal; archeology; article; bone; food preference; geography; hominid; human; mammal; meat; paleontology; Tanzania; Animals; Archaeology; Bone and Bones; Food Preferences; Geography; Hominidae; Humans; Mammals; Meat; Paleontology; Tanzania; Tanzania, Olduvai Gorge",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031448606

This revisionist interpretation has brought a reconciliation with the Darwinian paradigm of gradual progressive evolution that has traditionally guided (and very often, misled) an important part of anthropological thinking. However, empirical support for the scavenging hypothesis is still lacking. Recent data based on bone surface modifications from archaeological faunas suggest, in contrast, that hominids were primary agents of carcass exploitation. Meat seems to have been an important part of Plio-Pleistocene hominid diets. Passive scavenging scenarios show that this kind of opportunistic strategy cannot afford significant meat yields. Therefore, the hunting hypothesis has not yet been disproved. This makes the hunting-and-scavenging issue more controversial than before, and calls for a revision of the current interpretive frameworks and ideas about early human behavior.","East Africa; Human evolution; Hunting; Meat-eating; Plio-Pleistocene; Scavenging","hunting; scavenging",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036121914

As such, they hold some of the oldest available information on cognitive ability and behaviour in human evolution. Here we present a new method that allows a three-dimensional reconstruction of cutmark morphology and the quantification of profile parameters. We have tested this new technique on cutmarks that were experimentally inflicted on a pig rib using a steel knife and an un-retouched flint flake at different angles. The method allows for the cross-sectional shape, the sharpness and depths of the resulting cutmarks to be quantified. The data show that knife mark sections are characterised by a V-shape or √-shape depending on the inclination of the knife. Cutmarks produced with the flint flake were less clearly defined and generally less sharp than those produced by the knife. We discuss the method's potential to provide new information on butchery technique and cognitive abilities developed by the human lineage, from the earliest tool-using hominins through to modern Homo sapiens. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we review the empirical basis for these inferences in light of ethnoarchaeological data from the Tanzanian Hadza, a modern East African foraging population. Comparison of the Hadza data with those produced by other actualistic work indicates that while there may be a relationship between cut and tooth mark distributions and order of consumer access (human- versus carnivore-first), it is less clear-cut than many have suggested. Application of these results to the analysis of Plio-Pleistocene archaeological collections is further complicated by inconsistencies in the ways cut and tooth marks have been defined and counted, and by significant differences between patterns observed in modern control samples and those reported at ancient sites. These observations indicate that cut and tooth mark analyses are unlikely to speak effectively to questions about early human carnivory in the absence of: (1) better-warranted, more comprehensive expectations about the potential range of variation in past human carcass acquisition strategies, (2) a larger, more rigorously designed set of control experiments that model the archaeological consequences of these strategies, and (3) a larger, more consistently analysed archaeological data base. Even if these requirements are met, the idea of meat-eating as an important catalyst in the evolution of early humans will remain highly problematic, mainly due to problems involving the frequency and short-term reliability of carcass access. © 2002 Academic Press.","Cut marks; Hadza; Olduvai gorge; Plio-pleistocene archaeology; Tooth marks","archaeological evidence; carnivory; hunting; scavenging; Tanzania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036171496

Morphological attributes of the cut marks were measured using an Alicona imaging microscope, a novel optical technique that generates three-dimensional virtual reconstructions of surface features. The study shows that high-resolution measurements of cut marks can shed light on aspects of butchery techniques, tool use and the behavioural repertoire of Lower Palaeolithic hominins. Differences between the experimental cut marks and those on the Boxgrove large mammal bones suggest variation in the angle of the cuts and greater forces used in the butchery of the larger (rhinoceros-sized) carcasses at Boxgrove. Tool-edge characteristics may account for some of these differences, but the greater robusticity of the Boxgrove hominins (attributed to Homo heidelbergensis) may be a factor in the greater forces indicated by some of the cut marks on the Boxgrove specimens. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The author conducted experiments to establish the relationship between the edge characteristics of metal and stone tools that create slicing cut-marks and the marks they produce when applied to bone. The type of tool used to produce such cut-marks on bone can be identified by taking silicone moulds of slicing cut-marks and analysing them in a scanning electron microscope. Quantifying the distribution of metal versus stone tool types over time and space provides insight into the processes underlying the introduction and diffusion of a functional metallurgical technology for subsistence activities. Prehistoric data from the central Balkans of southeast Europe are presented to illustrate the utility of the procedure. These data are used to calculate the frequency of use and relative importance of stone and metal implements over time in the central Balkans, from the introduction of metallurgy during the Late Neolithic (c. 3900-3300 BC) through the end of the Bronze Age (c. 1000 BC).","Cut-marks; Experimental archaeology; Metallurgy; Scanning electron microscopy; Zooarchaeology","archaeological evidence; bone; metallurgy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033405768

Certain archaeological situations, especially those dealing with the recovery and analysis of battle casualties, may raise questions about what type(s) of bladed weapon was used in a particular conflict (e.g., the battle of Kamakura, Japan, AD 1333; the battle of Wisby, Sweden, AD 1361; the battle of Towton, England, AD 1461). Little work has been done, however, on developing criteria to differentiate sword cut marks from other types of cut marks, or to distinguish between marks created by different sword types. To develop such criteria, bovine tibiae (n = 7) were struck using six different types of bladed weapon and the resulting marks (n = 92) were analyzed. Eight traits describing the morphology of the cut mark - such as shape, the presence and unilateral/bilateral state of flaking and feathering, the presence of bone shards, associated breaks, etc. - are defined and related to blade type used. Sword marks were found to be easily distinguishable from knife marks. The variation in marks made by different sword types is significantly correlated with differences in blade weight (p < 0.0001), grip (p < 0.0113), and sharpness (p ≤ 0.0179). The criteria and analyses developed and implemented in this study will be of use to researchers in forensics and osteoarchaeology who want to infer bladed weapon type from marks on bones. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In order partly to rectify this situation, I conducted two types of two-stage, or dual-patterned, actualistic studies to simulate whole carcass processing by hominids (stage one) followed by carnivores (stage two) in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro ecosystems of Tanzania in 1990 and 1991. Thirty whole-bone to carnivore experiments, which model hominid defleshing, and 39 hammerstone to carnivore experiments, which model the removal of flesh, marrow, the brain, and the mandibular nerve by hominids, were conducted to model variability in the behaviour of early hominids and determine its effect on secondary bone modification by carnivores. Vultures, maribou storks, jackals, and spotted hyenas were observed modifying bones from experiments in both samples; however, the overwhelming majority of bone modification was conducted by spotted hyenas. In stage two, spotted hyenas (1) deleted between 90 and 100% of the axial and compact elements placed in both experimental samples; (2) deleted 79·7% of long-bone epiphyses produced by hammerstone breakage and 98·9% of epiphyses from intact long bones; (3) placed at least one tooth mark on 64·3 and 23·2% of all the specimens recovered from whole-bone to carnivore and hammerstone to carnivore experiments, respectively; and (4) added and subtracted specimens which altered the number of specimens bearing at least one cut mark, scrape mark, and/or percussion mark. These results all reflect the cumulative and variable actions of hominids (via simulation) and spotted hyenas. Therefore, it is not possible to delete traces produced by carnivores without removing data indicative of hominid behaviour as well. © 1998 Academic Press Limited.","Actualistic studies; Control samples; Dual-patterning; Experimental zooarchaeology; Generality; Precision; Realism","bone modification; carnivore; hominid; taphonomy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031869681

However, few studies have addressed techniques or protocols for assessing quantitative differences between tool marks on bone made by different bladed implements. In this study, the statistical variation in cut mark width was examined between control and test samples on bone using a scalpel blade, paring knife, and kitchen utility knife. Statistically significant differences (p < .0005) were found between cut marks made by the same knife under control and test conditions for all three knife types used in the study. When the control sample and test samples were examined individually for differences in mean variation between knife types, significant differences were also found (p < .0005). While significant differences in cut mark width were found, caution should be used in trying to classify individual cut marks as being inflicted by a particular implement, due to the overlap in cut mark width that exists between different knife types. When combined, both quantitative and qualitative analyses of cut marks should prove to be more useful in trying to identify a suspect weapon. Furthermore, the application of SEM can be particularly useful for assessing many of these features.","Cut mark; Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Knife; Scanning electron microscopy; Sharp-force trauma; Tool mark analysis","article; forensic identification; knife cut; physical anthropology; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; weapon; Bone and Bones; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Humerus; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Wounds and Injuries",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034748154

For most butchering tasks, primary flakes with unmodified working edges were more effective than bifacially pressure-flaked tools. The data presented indicate considerable variability among animal species in the demands placed on tools used for specific butchering tasks. It is suggested that consideration by prehistoric hunters of factors such as tool longevity and raw material availability could have resulted in the use of butchering tools with less than optimal cutting characteristics.

Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classifications were suggested. This article presents an innovative methodology which supplements the microscopic study of cut marks. Despite the benefits of using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the two-dimensional identification of these marks, it has a number of drawbacks such as the high costs and, consequently, the limited sample studied. In this article, a low-cost technique for the analysis of cut mark micromorphology from a tri-dimensional perspective is introduced. It provides a high-resolution approach to cut mark characterisation such as morphology, depth, width, and angle estimation as well as section determination, measured directly on the marks on bones. Macro-photogrammetry records quantitative and qualitative information which can be statistically processed with standard multivariate and geometric morphometric tools. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer vision; Cut marks; Image-based modelling; Macro-photogrammetry; Taphonomy","archaeological evidence; bone; image analysis; micromorphology; modeling; photogrammetry; taphonomy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939196614

The present study analyses this variability using multivariate statistics on a set of 14 variables that involve differential skeletal element representation, fragmentation processes, carnivore ravaging impact, carcass size and tool type. All these variables affect the resulting cut mark frequencies reported in archaeological sites. A large sample of archaeofaunal assemblages has been used for this study. It was concluded that the best estimator of cut mark frequency in any given assemblage is the percentage of cut-marked long bone specimens (probably due to its better preservation than other anatomical areas), which is determined by fragmentation and carnivore ravaging. Carcass size and tool type also play a major role in differences in cut mark frequencies. Fragmentation is also a key variable determining the abundance of cut-marked specimens. It is argued that general cut mark percentages are of limited value, given the number of variables that determine them, and that a more heuristic approach involves quantifying cut marks in a qualitative manner. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This enables the direct observation of their shape from several points of view and the relatively rapid procurement of a variety of measurements (e.g. depth, breadth, angles). This technology has been applied to several butchery experiments, in which both stone and metal tools have been used to produce cut marks on skeletal elements. The morphometrical parameters presented in this paper enabled the correct identification of the different origins of experimental striations and were further tested on two archaeological sets of cut marks inflicted by both metal blades and flint flakes or tools.

Taphonomic and experimental approaches have been systematically applied in an effort to understand the technical and artistic procedures followed. In this study, we applied a new combination of 3-dimensional microscopy (focus variation optical microscope) and micro-CT scanning to the analysis of two Magdalenian engraved specimens: a reindeer antler from the site of Neschers (France), engraved with the partial image of a horse in left profile, and a horse metatarsal from Courbet Cave, Penne (France), engraved with a horse head also in left profile. Results of the analysis suggest that both the Neschers and Courbet Cave engravings had been prepared before being carved. The overall contours of the horse body/head were incised first, while anatomical features were added afterwards. In the Neschers case, the incision resulted from the repeated scratching of a previously made incision in order to enlarge the engraving, possibly reflecting the engraver's aesthetic sense. The combination of the techniques used in this study is applicable to fragile or unique archaeological specimens. Micro-CT scanning, in particular, provides non-invasive means for identifying engravings that are obscured by encrusted sediment. The application of these techniques can potentially open new avenues for the authentication, technical and gestural recognition and interpretation of incised forms and artistic creativity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Courbet Cave; Engraving; Focus variation microscopy; Magdalenian portable art; Micro-CT; Neschers","archaeological evidence; art; bone; Paleolithic; taphonomy; France; Animalia; Equidae; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874404546

In a previous study an attempt was made to compare the methods used on antelope and on bison, but the methods were those of very different peoples who were widely separated both geographically and temporally and the differences could as easily have been due to culture as well as the size of the game.

This work focuses on a sample of cut-marked bones from the Bell's Korongo (BK) site (Upper Bed II, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania), which is an emblematic early Pleistocene site where a large faunal assemblage, including a diverse megafauna, occurs in association with quartzite and basalt industries. We present a detailed study of a sample of 58 cut marks identified on a set of recently excavated BK fossils, using a micro-photogrammetric and geometric morphometric approach, with the aim of identifying the raw materials used in the butchery of carcasses. In order to carry out this study, we previously carried out an experimental analysis to characterize cut marks and their morphology according to the types of raw material found at BK, namely quartzite and basalt. The results from the experimental study show that there is a good fit between raw material type and cut mark morphology, enabling us to confidently apply this method to the analysis of the cut marks of the BK fossil assemblage. The present study shows that most of the BK cut marks were created by the use of quartzite tools. The efficiency of this type of raw material is emphasized, which explains its curation over the landscape by hominins. © 2017 Collegium Boreas.

However, an important step in this research has been overlooked and after years of work, we lack both a universal and replicable protocol and an understanding of the precision of these techniques. Here we propose a new standard for identifying bone surface modifications using high-resolution 3-D data and offer a systematic and replicable approach for researchers to follow. Data were collected with a white-light non-contact confocal profilometer and analyzed with Digital Surf's Mountains® software. Our data show that when methods are standardized, results between researchers are statistically indistinguishable. Multivariate analyses using the measured parameters allow discrimination between stone tool cut marks and mammalian carnivore tooth marks with 97.5% accuracy. Application of this method to fossil specimens resulted in 100% correspondence with identifications made by an experienced analyst using macroscopic observations of qualitative features of bone surface modifications. High-resolution 3-D analyses of bone surface modifications have great potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of taphonomic research, but only if our methods are replicable and precise. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Confocal profilometry; Cut mark; Feeding trace; Tooth mark","archaeological evidence; bone; carnivore; fossil record; hominid; multivariate analysis; quantitative analysis; Stone Age; Mammalia; anatomy and histology; animal; archeology; bone; fossil; hominid; multivariate analysis; procedures; three dimensional imaging; tool use; Animals; Archaeology; Bone and Bones; Fossils; Hominidae; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Multivariate Analysis; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006943933

A reasonable amount of wild cat remains, some bearing cut marks, were recovered during the archaeological excavations of the rock shelter site Galgenbühel/Dos de la Forca, located in South Tyrol (Adige Valley, Bolzano, Italy). The site was frequented from approximately 8500 to 7500BC cal. by Sauveterrian groups whose economy was centered on the exploitation of nearby wetlands and the forested valley bottom and slopes. The fauna comprises abundant fish remains, molluscs, pond turtles as well as mammals, the latter dominated by the beaver, the wild boar and the red deer. In the reconstruction of hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies, it often thought that carnivores were exploited primarily for their fur. The present taphonomic study was carried out to verify if the exploitation of wild cat by Mesolithic groups was related to the procurement of additional resources. The analysis of the archaeological sample regarding skeletal frequencies and cut-mark distribution was integrated by an experimental work conducted on modern cats in order to reconstruct the chaîne opératoire adopted by man for the treatment of the carcasses. The 3D digital microscope analysis provided for each stria morphometrical parameters in order to identify the origin of cut marks. The anthropic traces found in the wild cat assemblage of Galgenbühel/Dos de la Forca are only partly related to skinning. The localisation and the features of some marks attest disarticulation and therefore support the use of F. silvestris as food. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeology; carnivore; exploitation; felid; hunter-gatherer; Mesolithic; shelter; skeletal remains; subsistence; taphonomy; Alps; Austria; Eastern Alps; Tyrol; Cervus elaphus; Emydidae; Felis silvestris; Mammalia; Mollusca; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898796061

The advantage of optical laser scanning for the study of fossil and sub-fossil bone is its non-contact nature, allowing the investigation of fragile and poorly preserved surfaces. The high resolution and fast measuring rate of this method make it an alternative to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation if topography is to be visualized. This study analyses clusters of incisions in a suid humeral fragment from the Pliocene Upper Laetolil Beds. The marks show a characteristic crest structure that is also frequently found in mandible marks produced by the Australian termite species Mastotermes darwiniensis. The marks from the Laetolil Beds are, therefore, interpreted as also being caused by insect mandible action. An as yet unknown large insect species capable of modifying bone with their mandibles is thus postulated in the palaeohabitat represented by the hominid-bearing Upper Laetolil Beds.

Micromorphological analyses of cut-marks have been shown to further the interpretation of hominin behavioural patterns. However, to date, the microscopic investigation of cut-marks has been limited to two-dimensional analyses or to the qualitative assessment of three-dimensional (3D) morphology. A new technology using the Alicona 3D InfiniteFocus imaging microscope reported here surpasses any current observational or microscopic method for the analysis of cut-marks. By creating a series of image planes and overlapping focus levels to construct a 3D composite image, vertical variations in the surface structure can be used to interpret differences in the mechanical impact caused by different types of tool and different butchery techniques. Three case studies are presented. The first describes cut-marks observed on the human anterior teeth from the Middle Pleistocene site of Boxgrove (West Sussex, England) which are interpreted as indications of two possible types of human behaviour: the use of the mouth as a third hand and postmortem treatment of the body. The second case study, an analysis of cut-marks on human remains at the Later Upper Palaeolithic (Magdalenian) site of Gough's Cave (Somerset, England), questions the interpretation of cannibalism previously accepted for this site by suggesting the hypothesis of burial ritual involving the butchering, but not the consumption, of human bodies. Finally, the butchery techniques adopted at Boxgrove and Gough's Cave are compared. This third study indicates that differences in the micromorphological characteristics of cut-marks reflect diversity in the type of tools used at these two sites. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Boxgrove; Butchery technique; Cannibalism; Cut-marks; Gough's Cave; Human behaviour",,Book,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049463323

The overlap of their ecological niches has raised an important debate on the role that carnivores played in archaeological site formation. Different analytical techniques differentiate the action of carnivores and humans and identify the type of carnivore involved of which tooth mark analyses are prominent. However, available taphonomic studies present some limitations given the great overlap among tooth mark sizes from different carnivores, enabling only the distinction of size groups, not specific carnivores. In this work, we use a new technique combining three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and geometric morphometrics (GMM) of tooth pits on equid and bovid bone created by different carnivores (including crocodiles, hyenas, jaguars, lions and wolves) in controlled settings. The 3D methodology we present isolates and differentiates tooth marks generated by different carnivores. We also test the applicability of the technique to ascribe tooth pits recorded on some hominin specimens from FLK Zinj and FLKNN 3 (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). The tooth marks on the Olduvai OH8 and OH35 hominin fossils, previously assigned to crocodiles show that while OH8 tooth pit morphology falls in the range created by crocodiles, the pits on OH35 can not be interpreted as crocodile-inflicted marks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Geometric morphometrics; Homo habilis; Micro-photogrammetry; Taphonomy; Tooth marks","archaeology; bone; carnivore; crocodilian; feeding behavior; fossil record; geometry; hominid; morphometry; Olduvai event; photogrammetry; reconstruction; taphonomy; three-dimensional modeling; tooth; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania; Bovidae; Canidae; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Equidae; Homo habilis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019375211

Until now, the SEM has offered unparalleled depth of field and surface rendition. SEM units are, however, expensive to acquire and maintain, and SEM image production is time-intensive. Furthermore, SEM images lack color and are often incapable of imaging bone modifications because of magnification and chamber size limitations. A digital imaging method for producing extremely high depth of field enlargements of three dimensional, sub-millimeter scale objects circumvents these problems. In our presentation we employ four case studies of hard tissue modification related to: (1) the origins of meat-eating in the human lineage; (2) evidence for cannibalistic behavior among Neanderthals; (3) pre-Columbian evidence of Noah American dentistry; and (4) the earliest evidence of cranial surgery in North America. Procedures for replica production, image-capture, and image enhancement are provided. The digital images produced are compared to those obtained with the SEM.

The method, which involves recording the movements of a diamond‐tipped stylus as it scans the surface being studied, is demonstrated on a Neolithic cranium from Sweden. The cranium emanates from a pile dwelling dated to about 3000 B.C. Its frontal bone exhibits distinct cut marks indicative of scalping, and the teeth show signs of enamel hypoplasia. The surface topography of the putative cut marks and hypoplastic enamel were investigated using the stylus method. Measurements of enamel hypoplasia were also carried out for comparison on a front tooth from the lower jaw, and the cut mark study was compared with scanning electron micrographs. The results of this case study demonstrate that the stylus method can obtain high‐resolution measurements of fine surface details directly on the original bone without preparation of or damage to the specimen.

Understanding the anatomical location of cut marks is crucial for interpreting the butchery behaviour of humans in the past, as well as for indirectly inferring the subsistence and economic function of archaeological sites. Two experimental/ethnoarchaeological studies have provided taphonomists with analogues to interpret filleting and disarticulation butchery behaviours from archaeofaunal assemblages. However, these analogues were made with limited control and both involved the use of metal knives. The present work provides the first systematic and controlled study of cut mark distribution on long bones made with stone tools, aimed at differentiating cut marks created by filleting or defleshing from those inflicted during disarticulation. It also studies the variability of cut mark distribution according to stone tool type (simple flakes, retouched flakes and handaxes). The results show some differences with previous studies made with metal tools and offer an updated analogue to interpret butchery (filleting, dismembering and skinning) from prehistoric contexts. © 2012 University of Oxford.","Analogy; Cut marks; Disarticulation; Filleting; Handaxes; Retouched flakes; Simple flakes","anatomy; archaeological evidence; bone; experimental study; fossil record; skeletal remains; taphonomy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887825525

These studies have brought to light, with relative precision, the features that identify and differentiate the two types of modifications. However, few studies differentiate these modifications after they have been affected by other factors. Chemical alteration, related to lixiviated sediments, is documented in a relatively high number of archaeological sites. Following the criteria established by Domínguez-Rodrigo etal. (2009), the aim of this paper is to know if diagnostic criteria that would allow modifications resulting from trampling to be differentiated from cut mark modifications are preserved, after undergoing chemical alterations. The results have been applied to unidentified marks located on faunal skeletal remains from the La Mina site, at the Barranc de la Boella (Tarragona, Spain), the surfaces of which have been heavily modified by the lixiviation of the sediments. The data suggest that chemically altered marks lose the diagnostic criteria necessary for correct identification. The unidentified marks discovered on remains from la Boella could not be verified as cut or trampling marks and therefore cannot be considered in future zooarchaeological and taphonomical studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Barranc de la Boella; Chemical alteration; Cut marks; La Mina; Trampling","archaeological evidence; chemical alteration; sediment; skeletal remains; trampling; archaeology; experimental study; identification method; Catalonia; Spain; Tarragona [Catalonia]",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904541163

Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classification have been suggested. Different techniques, such as three-dimensional digital microscope (3D DM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) have been recently applied to the study of cut marks. Although the 3D DM and LSCM microscopic techniques are the most commonly used for the 3D identification of cut marks, M-PG has also proved to be very efficient and a low-cost method. M-PG is a noninvasive technique that allows the study of the cortical surface without any previous preparation of the samples, and that generates high-resolution models. Despite the current application of microscopic and micro-photogrammetric techniques to taphonomy, their reliability has never been tested. In this paper, we compare 3D DM, LSCM and M-PG in order to assess their resolution and results. In this study, we analyse 26 experimental cut marks generated with a metal knife. The quantitative and qualitative information registered is analysed by means of standard multivariate statistics and geometric morphometrics to assess the similarities and differences obtained with the different methodologies. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2017 Royal Microscopical Society","Experimental cut marks; laser scanning confocal microscopy; micro-photogrammetry; statistical agreement; three-dimensional digital microscope","analytic method; Article; biometry; bone; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; intermethod comparison; micro photogrammetry; morphometry; nonhuman; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; surface property; three dimensional digital microscopy; analysis of variance; confocal microscopy; devices; image processing; photogrammetry; procedures; reproducibility; standards; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Analysis of Variance; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Microscopy, Confocal; Models, Statistical; Photogrammetry; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018756590

One of them is related to the action of carnivores, which is reflected in conspicuous tooth marks, such as pits, scores, punctures or furrowing. Different carnivores damage bone assemblages differently. Thus, several researches have tried to identify carnivore agency based on different parameters such as skeletal profiles, tooth mark frequencies and dimensions, breakage patterns, or more recently, taphotypes. Here we propose a new methodology based on the analysis of tooth scores to determine the carnivore type involved in bone modification. For this purpose, we have built 3D models of several tooth scores produced by wolves, lions, jaguars, foxes and hyenas using photogrammetric techniques. These models were later analyzed by means of Geometric Morphometrics and multivariate statistics. We show that although there is a high degree of overlap in tooth mark morphology, the combined action of tooth score dimensions and morphology enables the identification of some of the tooth scores made by lions from those of the other carnivores with a higher degree of confidence than any other inter-carnivore comparison. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Computer vision; Image-based modelling; Micro-Photogrammetry; Scores; Taphonomy of carnivores; Tooth marks",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019725876

The faunal sample analysed here is distributed in different archaeological levels and is associated with a significant lithic accumulation including several large format tools and handaxes. The fauna indicates the proliferation of open environments similar to those found in other Bed II and late Bed I sites. Evidence of anthropogenic activity (e.g. defleshing activities and marrow consumption) has been identified in the form of cut and percussion marks. A photogrammetric and morphometric analysis suggests that these marks were produced with quartzite flakes and not with handaxes. Evidence of interaction with carnivores was also noted; tooth marks were observed on some bones. Such interaction indicates the existence of competition between humans and carnivores for the same ecological niche, and might lead us to reflect on the survival strategies of Lower Pleistocene hominins. © 2017 Collegium Boreas.

Different criteria have been suggested for the description and classification of cut marks. The methods commonly used for the study of cut marks rely on high-cost microscopy techniques with low portability (i.e., inability to work in situ), such as the 3D digital microscope (3D DM) or laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Recently, new algorithmic developments in the field of computer vision and photogrammetry, have achieved very high precision and resolution, offering a portable and low-cost alternative to microscopic techniques. However, the photogrammetric techniques present some disadvantages, such as longer data collection and processing time, and the requirement of some photogrammetric expertise for the calibration of the cameras and the acquisition of precise image orientation. In this paper, we compare two low-cost techniques and their application to cut mark studies: the micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) technique presented, developed, and validated previously, and a methodology based on the use of a structured light scanner (SLS). A total of 47 experimental cut marks, produced using a stainless steel knife, were analyzed. The data registered through virtual reconstruction was analyzed by means of three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (GMM). © 2017 by the authors.","Bones; Cut marks; Low-cost; Micro-photogrammetry; Statistical agreement; Structured light laser scanner","Bone; Costs; Data handling; Digital devices; Laser applications; Scanning; Stainless steel; Cut marks; Geometric morphometrics; Laser scanner; Laser scanning confocal microscopy; Low costs; Photogrammetric technique; Statistical comparisons; Virtual reconstruction; Photogrammetry",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029389739

Development of morphological classification methods using measurements from cut mark cross sections could have multiple uses across palaeoanthropological and archaeological disciplines, where cutting edge types are used to investigate and reconstruct behavioral patterns. An experimental study was undertaken, using porcine bone, to determine the usefulness of discriminant function analysis in classifying cut marks by blade edge type, from a number of measurements taken from their cross-sectional profile. The discriminant analysis correctly classified 86.7% of the experimental cut marks into serrated, non-serrated and bamboo blade types. The technique was then used to investigate a series of cut marks of unknown origin from a collection of trophy skulls from the Torres Strait Islands, to investigate whether they were made by bamboo or metal blades. Nineteen out of twenty of the cut marks investigated were classified as bamboo which supports the non-contemporaneous ethnographic accounts of the knives used for trophy taking and defleshing remains. With further investigation across a variety of blade types, this technique could prove a valuable tool in the interpretation of cut mark evidence from a wide variety of contexts, particularly in forensic anthropology where the requirement for presentation of evidence in a statistical format is becoming increasingly important. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","infinite focus microscopy; Torres Strait Islands; trophy skulls","metal; accuracy; adult; animal tissue; article; bamboo; classification; discriminant analysis; experimental pig; experimental study; island (geological); laceration; measurement; nonhuman; rib; skull; tool use; animal; Australia; biological model; cannibalism; child; devices; discriminant analysis; ethnology; female; human; male; mandible; pathology; physical anthropology; preschool child; swine; technology; weapon; Adult; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Australia; Cannibalism; Child; Child, Preschool; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Mandible; Models, Biological; Ribs; Skull; Swine; Technology; Weapons",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904042270

It is often assumed that this change is associated with dietary expansion to incorporate large mammal resources. Although other aspects of the hominin diet, such as aquatic or vegetal resources, are assumed to be a part of hominin subsistence, identifying evidence of these adaptations has proved difficult. Here we present a series of analyses that provide methodological support for the inclusion of aquatic resources in hominin dietary reconstructions. We suggest that bone surface modifications in aquatic species are morphologically distinguishable from bone surface modifications on terrestrial taxa. We relate these findings to differences that we document in the surface mechanical properties of the two types of bone, as reflected by significant differences in bone surface microhardness values between aquatic and terrestrial species. We hypothesize that the characteristics of bone surface modifications on aquatic taxa inhibit the ability of zooarchaeologists to consistently diagnose them correctly. Contingently, this difficulty influences correspondence levels between zooarchaeologists, and may therefore result in misinterpretation of the taphonomic history of early Pleistocene aquatic faunal assemblages. A blind test using aquatic specimens and a select group of 9 experienced zooarchaeologists as participants was designed to test this hypothesis. Investigation of 4 different possible explanations for blind test results suggest the dominant factors explaining patterning relate to (1) the specific methodologies employed to diagnose modifications on aquatic specimens and (2) the relative experience of participants with modifications on aquatic bone surfaces. Consequently we argue that an important component of early hominin diets may have hitherto been overlooked as a result of (a) the paucity of referential frameworks within which to identify such a component and (b) the inability of applied identification methodologies to consistently do so. © 2013 Archer, Braun.",,"aquatic fauna; aquatic species; archeology; article; bone characteristics and functions; bone examination; bone structure; bone surface microhardness; dietary intake; evolutionary adaptation; fossil hominin; Pleistocene; resource management; species difference; terrestrial species; zoology; Animals; Bone and Bones; Catfishes; Cichlids; Diet; Food Handling; Hominidae; Kenya; Paleontology; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882617036

The mound was found to contain a mixed skeletal assemblage, the majority of which was disarticulated. Between 2000 and 2001 material from the site including human bone was re-examined with a portion of this project focused on taphonomic evidence observed on the human skeletal material. Amongst the factors selected for investigation were deliberate toolmarks. Three specimens were identified as exhibiting toolmarks. Analysis demonstrated that the observed features were cutmarks, consistent with the use of flint tools. However those on two of the specimens were found to be both post-mortem and recent. The cutmarks observed on the remaining specimen, a right clavicle, were identified as having been inflicted during the peri-mortem period and consistent with decapitation. British Neolithic mortuary practice has been the subject of ongoing debate since the earliest excavations of relevant sites, but until very recently few assemblages from such contexts have been re-examined and much of the data in use has derived from sources of considerable age and questionable reliability. The selective removal of specific skeletal elements (particularly skulls) has repeatedly been described in the literature regarding the collective funerary monuments of this period. It has often been assumed that such practices took place after the soft tissues had decayed. One of the examples discussed, suggests this may not always have been the case and the potential significance of this finding is discussed in addition to a possible interpretation of the cutmarks seen on the remaining specimens.

Over the last several decades, however, BSM identification has remained contentious, particularly in terms of identifying the earliest instances of hominin butchery; there has been a lack of consensus over how to identify or differentiate marks made by human and non-human actors and varying effectors. Most investigations have relied on morphology to identify butchery marks and their patterning. This includes cut marks, one of the most significant human marks. Attempts to discriminate cut marks from other types of marks have employed a variety of techniques, ranging from subjectively characterizing cut mark morphology using the naked eye, to using high-powered microscopy such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or micro-photogrammetry. More recent approaches use 3D datasets to obtain even more detailed information about mark attributes, and apply those to the fossil record. Although 3D datasets open promising new avenues for investigation, analyses of these datasets have not yet taken advantage of the full 3D surface morphology of BSM. Rather, selected cross-sectional slices of 3D scans have been used as proxies for overall shape. Here we demonstrate that 3D geometric morphometrics (GM), under the “Procrustes paradigm” and coupled with a Bayesian approach, probabilistically discriminates between marks caused by different butchery behaviors. At the same time, this approach provides a complete set of 3D morphological measurements and descriptions. Our results strengthen statistical confidence in cut mark identification and offer a novel approach that can be used to discriminate subtle differences between cut mark types in the fossil record. Furthermore, this study provides an incipient digital library with which to make future quantitative comparisons to archaeological examples, including contentious specimens that are key to understanding the earliest hominin butchery. © 2017 The Authors","Butchery; Cut marks; Multivariate methods; Shape; Taphonomy","Bayesian analysis; bone; geometry; human evolution; morphometry; multivariate analysis; shape; taphonomy; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044392529

Thus, metal tool use has been differentiated in contexts with an abundance of lithic tools, or even the use of hand axes has been documented in carcass processing, in contrast with simple unretouched or retouched flakes. As important as this information is, there are still other important aspects to be analysed. Can cut marks produced with different lithic raw material types be differentiated? Can cut marks made with different types of the same raw material type be characterized and differentiated? The objective of this study is to evaluate if cut marks resulting from the use of different flints and different quartzites are distinguishable from each other. In the present work, an experimental analysis of hundreds of cut marks produced by five types of flint and five varieties of quartzite was carried out. Microphotogrammetry and geometric–morphometric techniques were applied to analyse these cut marks. The results show that flint cut marks and quartzite cut marks can be characterized at the assemblage level. Different types of flint produced cut marks that were not significantly different from each other. Cut marks made with Olduvai Gorge quartzite were significantly different from those produced with a set comprising several other types of quartzites. Crystal size, which is larger in Olduvai Gorge quartzites (0.5 mm) than Spanish quartzites (177–250 μm), is discussed as being the main reason for these statistically significant differences. This documented intra-sample and inter-sample variance does not hinder the resolution of the approach to differentiate between these two generic raw material types and opens the door for the application of this method in archaeological contexts. © 2017 University of Oxford","cut marks; flint; micro-morphometry; micro-photogrammetry; quartzite; raw materials","archaeology; flint; lithic fragment; morphometry; photogrammetry; quartzite; tool use",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028314535

The present study attempts to verify this hypothesis by performing incisions into pig body parts at different stages of decay, using different hand pressures and two different types of tool. Focus variation microscopy was used for metric evaluations of experimentally produced cut marks. The clearest metric correlation observed was that greater cutting strength produces wider and deeper cut marks. We also observed that in general, when using the same strength, wider and deeper cut marks are produced on bone with less meat due to the decay (i.e. reduction) of organic tissues. It was also observed that liquefying tissues affect the precision of incisions, causing tools to slip on decaying remains. Finally, no clear metric or morphological differences were observed between cut marks produced using unretouched flakes and unretouched blades. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cannibalism vs defleshing; Experimental archaeology; Focus variation microscopy; Scavenging vs hunting",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041635078
