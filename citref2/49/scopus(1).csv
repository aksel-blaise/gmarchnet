This article examines morphological, chemical, and molecular character expression in hybrids to determine whether traditionally recognized properties of hybrid plants, such as hybrid intermediacy and character coherence, are actually supported by empirical evidence, and also examines the impact of hybrids on phylogenetic analyses. We show that hybrids are a mosaic of both parental and intermediate morphological characters rather than just intermediate ones, and that a large proportion of first (64%) and later generation hybrids (89%) exhibit extreme or novel characters. Chemical character expression in hybrids is more predictable, with predominantly additive or complementary expression for both first generation hybrids (68%) and hybrid taxa (54%). Likewise, the genetic basis, and thus the expression of molecular characters, is well-worked out and predictable, although non-Mendelian inheritance has been reported in a few instances for molecular markers as well. There is even less empirical support for the concept of character coherence than hybrid intermediacy. Although morphological character coherence has been reported in both artificial and natural hybrid populations, it appears to be the exception rather than the rule. This idiosyncratic relationship among morphological characters is shown to be the norm for the relationship of morphological to molecular characters, as well as for the relationship among molecular characters. Hybrids are shown to have little impact on the topology of nonhybrid taxa in phylogenetic trees. However, the expression of primitive vs. derived character states, the placement of hybrids in cladograms, the number of equally parsimonious trees produced, and the effects of hybrids on phylogenetic topology do not appear to be predictable. Thus, cladistic identification of hybrid taxa is difficult and may not be possible based on phenotypic data, regardless of the analytical tools used. © 1993 by CRC Press, Inc.","character coherence; character expression; hybrid zones; hybridization; phylogenetic reconstruction",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952380109

The arrangement of the muscle-tendon units around the lever-like joints means that as the leg shortens the muscle-tendon units are stretched. The forelimb anatomy means that the leg can be conceptually divided into two springs: the proximal spring, from the scapula to the elbow, and the distal spring, from the elbow to the foot. In this paper we report the results of a series of experiments testing the hypothesis that there is minimal scope for muscle contraction in either spring to adjust limb compliance. Firstly, we demonstrate that the distal, passive leg spring changes length by 127 mm (range 106-128 mm) at gallop and the proximal spring by 12 mm (9-15 mm). Secondly, we demonstrate that there is a linear relationship between limb force and metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) joint angle that is minimally influenced by digital flexor muscle activation in vitro or as a function of gait in vivo. Finally, we determined the relationship between MCP joint angle and vertical ground-reaction force at trot and then predicted the forelimb peak vertical ground-reaction force during a 12 m s-1 gallop on a treadmill. These were 12.79 N kg-1 body mass (BM) (range 12.07-13.73 N kg-1 BM) for the lead forelimb and 15.23 N kg-1 BM(13.51-17.10 N kg-1 BM) for the non-lead forelimb.","Equus caballus; Gait; Horse; Locomotion; Stiffness; Tendon","animal; article; biomechanics; forelimb; gait; histology; horse; in vitro study; muscle contraction; physiology; running; Animals; Biomechanics; Forelimb; Gait; Horses; Muscle Contraction; Running; Animalia; Equus; Equus caballus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038076117

Ground reaction force (GRF) data were collected from 20 clinically sound Dutch Warmblood horses. The data from at least 5 stance phases of each limb were averaged after standardisation to the animal's body mass and to the stance phase duration and resulted in ‘representative’ GRF data. The symmetry in the vertical GRF peak amplitudes, impulses and the stance phase duration comparing left and right limbs exceeded 97%. By averaging the ‘representative’ GRF of the 20 horses a ‘standard’ GRF pattern of the Dutch Warmblood horse at the trot was constructed. The GRF patterns at the trot, compared with those at the walk, showed only one vertical force peak in forelimbs and hindlimbs (11.59 N/kg and 10.21 N/kg, respectively). The retardatory and propulsory forces were distributed over the forelimbs and hindlimbs in such a way that the forelimbs contributed more to retardation (peak forces 1.13 and 0.79 N/kg), and the hindlimbs more to propulsion (−0.84 and −1.17 N/kg, respectively). © 1993 EVJ Ltd","ground reaction force; horse; trot","animal; article; forelimb; gait; hindlimb; horse; physiology; reference value; Animal; Forelimb; Gait; Hindlimb; Horses; Reference Values",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027568467

Here, we evaluate the accuracy of predicting peak GRFz from duty factor (the proportion of the stride for which the limb is in contact with the ground). Foot-mounted uniaxial accelerometers, combined with UHF FM telemetry, are shown to be practical and accurate for the field measurement of stride timing variables, including duty factor. Direct comparison with the force plate produces a mean error of 2.3 ms and 3.5 ms for the timing of foot on and foot off, respectively, across all gaits. Predictions of peak GRFz from duty factor show mean errors (with positive values indicating an overestimate) of 0.8±0.04 N kg -1 (13%; N=42; mean ± S.E.M.) at walk, -0.3±0.06 N kg-1 (3%; N=75) at trot, -2.3±0.27 N kg-1 (16%; N=18) for the non-lead limb at canter and +2.1±0.7 N kg-1 (19%; N=9) for the lead limb at canter. The substantial over- and underestimate seen at canter, in the lead and non-lead limbs, respectively, is attributed to the different functions performed by the two limbs in the asymmetrical gaits. The difference in load experienced by the lead and non-lead limbs decreased with increasing speed.","Accelerometer; Duty factor; Field locomotion; Ground reaction force; Horse","acceleration; animal; article; biomechanics; comparative study; forelimb; gait; hindlimb; horse; locomotion; physiology; telemetry; time; Acceleration; Animals; Biomechanics; Forelimb; Gait; Hindlimb; Horses; Locomotion; Telemetry; Time Factors; Animalia; Equus; Equus caballus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-8444225492

Proximal limb tendons were few and, where present, were relatively short. By contrast, distal limb tendons were numerous and long in comparison to mean muscle fascicle length, increasing potential for elastic energy storage. When compared with published data on thoracic limb muscles, proximal pelvic limb muscles were larger in volume and had shorter fascicles.

Without distinct phylogeographic structure in domestic donkey haplogroups and with little information on the genetic makeup of the ancestral African wild ass, however, it has been difficult to identify wild ancestors and geographical origins for the domestic mitochondrial clades. Our analysis of ancient archaeological and historic museum samples provides the first genetic information on the historic Nubian wild ass (Equus africanus africanus), Somali wild ass (Equus africanus somaliensis) and ancient donkey. The results demonstrate that the Nubian wild ass was an ancestor of the first donkey haplogroup. In contrast, the Somali wild ass has considerable mitochondrial divergence from the Nubian wild ass and domestic donkeys. These findings resolve the long-standing issue of the role of the Nubian wild ass in the domestication of the donkey, but raise new questions regarding the second ancestor for the donkey. Our results illustrate the complexity of animal domestication, and have conservation implications for critically endangered Nubian and Somali wild ass. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Ancient DNA; Donkey domestication; Nubian and Somali wild ass","ancestry; cladistics; domestication; endangered species; genetic analysis; phylogeography; species conservation; ungulate; North Africa; Animalia; Equus asinus; Equus asinus asinus; Equus asinus somalicus",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650320041

However, there are no whole-animal kinetic measurements of incline locomotion. Based on previous related research, we hypothesized that there would be a shift in forces to the hindlimb. The present study measured the force produced by the fore- and hindlimbs of horses while trotting over a range of speeds (2.5 to 5 m s-1) on both level and up an inclined (10%) surface. On the level, forelimb peak forces increased with trotting speed, but hindlimb peak force remained constant. On the incline, both fore- and hindlimb peak forces increased with speed, but the sum of the peak forces was lower than on the level. On the level, over the range of speeds tested, total force was consistently distributed between the limbs as 57% forelimb and 43% hindlimb, similar to the weight distribution of the horses during static weight tests. On the incline, the force distribution during locomotion shifted to 52% forelimb and 48% hindlimb. Time of contact and duty factor decreased with speed for both limbs. Time of contact was longer for the forelimb than the hindlimb, a finding not previously reported for quadrupeds. Time of contact of both limbs tended to be longer when traveling up the incline than on the level, but duty factor for both limbs was similar under both conditions. Duty factor decreased slightly with increased speed for the hindlimb on the level, and the corresponding small, predicted increase in peak vertical force could not be detected statistically.","Biomechanics; Force; Ground reaction force; Horse; Incline; Limb; Locomotion; Trotting","analysis of variance; animal; article; biomechanics; comparative study; forelimb; gait; hindlimb; horse; locomotion; physiology; videorecording; weight bearing; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Biomechanics; Forelimb; Gait; Hindlimb; Horses; Locomotion; Video Recording; Weight-Bearing; Animalia; Equidae; Equus caballus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-6344265566

We based this appreciation upon the detailed morphology of the distal part of the metapodials. Landmark approaches were applied to archaeological and palaeontological samples from three distinct areas: Switzerland Plateau, Paris Basin, and Charente (France). Little differences of isometric size characterized the three regional samples. Multivariate analyses of shape (principal component analysis, discriminant, canonical variates and neural network analyses) revealed similar sets of complex shape features on both metacarpals and metatarsals. In addition, regional groups appeared clearly differentiated by well defined shape patterns, the functional implications of which remain to be established. These results evidence the existence of a regional structuration of populations (particularly clear on the CVA of both metacarpals and metatarsals) suggesting the absence of long distance migrations. Finally, it appears that the distinction between size and shape systematically operated by geometric morphometrics can provide better insights into the study of the mobility of ancient populations. Geometric morphometrics approaches such as 3D Procrustes superimpositions, appear therefore to be of great interest for archaeological purposes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The great diversity in domestic animals and plants that exists today bears testament to the profound changes that domestication has induced in their ancestral wild forms over the last millennia. Domestication is a complex evolutionary process in which wild organisms are moved to new anthropogenic environments. Although modern genetics are significantly improving our understanding of domestication and breed formation, little is still known about the associated morphological changes linked to the process itself. In order to explore phenotypic variation induced by different levels of human control, we analysed the diversity of dental size, shape and allometry in modern free-living and captive wild, wild x domestic hybrid, domestic and insular Sus scrofa populations. Results: We show that domestication has created completely new dental phenotypes not found in wild boar (although the amount of variation amongst domestic pigs does not exceed that found in the wild). Wild boar tooth shape also appears to be biogeographically structured, likely the result of post-glacial recolonisation history. Furthermore, distinct dental phenotypes were also observed among domestic breeds, probably the result of differing types and intensity of past and present husbandry practices. Captivity also appears to impact tooth shape. Wild x domestic hybrids possess second molars that are strictly intermediate in shape between wild boar and domestic pigs (third molars, however, showing greater shape similarity with wild boar) while their size is more similar to domestic pigs. The dental phenotypes of insular Sus scrofa populations found on Corsica and Sardinia today (originally introduced by Neolithic settlers to the islands) can be explained either by feralization of the original introduced domestic swine or that the founding population maintained a wild boar phenotype through time. Conclusions: Domestication has driven significant phenotypic diversification in Sus scrofa. Captivity (environmental control), hybridization (genome admixture), and introduction to islands all correspond to differing levels of human control and may be considered different stages of the domestication process. The relatively well-known genetic evolutionary history of pigs shows a similar complexity at the phenotypic level. © 2015 Evin et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Artificial selection; Biogeography; Geometric morphometrics; Molars; Natural selection; Teeth","artificial ecosystem; captive population; dentition; domestication; hybrid; life history trait; morphology; natural selection; phenotype; phylogeography; pig; recolonization; wild population; Corse; France; Italy; Sardinia; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica; anatomy and histology; animal; domestic animal; genetic variability; genetics; human; hybridization; molecular evolution; phenotype; physiology; pig; tooth; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Variation; Humans; Hybridization, Genetic; Phenotype; Sus scrofa; Tooth",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924200297

Zooarchaeologists have attempted to study these changes osteologically in their search for the geographic and temporal origins of initial animal domestication during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Traditional biometric approaches have explored broad changes in body size over time, but this approach provides poor resolution. Here we investigate whether geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of cranial shape can be used to provide better resolution between wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), since shape is less affected by environmental factors than size. GMM combined with traditional multivariate statistics were applied to the crania of 42 modern domestic pigs (representing 6 breeds), 10 wild×domestic first generation hybrid pigs and 55 adult wild boar. Further analyses were carried out on morphologically discrete portions of the crania to simulate the fragmented nature of archaeological mammal remains. We found highly significant discrimination between wild and domestic pigs, both on the whole crania, and subsets including the parietal, the basicranium, the angle of the nasal and the zygomatic. We also demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate different domestic breeds on the basis of cranial morphology, and that 1st generation hybrid wild×domestic pig morphology more closely resembles wild pigs than domestic, suggesting that a wild phenotype (here represented by morphology) is dominant over a recessive domestic one. Our data demonstrate that GMM techniques can provide a quantifiable, clear classification between wild and domestic Sus (even using partial cranial remains) which has significant implications for zooarchaeological research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Crania; Domestication; Geometric morphometrics; Sus scrofa; Zooarchaeology","archaeology; biometry; body size; domestication; Holocene; morphometry; phenotype; pig; three-dimensional modeling; Animalia; Crania; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892961583

Consequently, they are poorly studied, even if they could possess species-specific information. Here, we use mandibles of white-toothed shrews and a taphonomic pattern of fragmentation composed of seven pieces to test their validity in species assignment. Using an extant non-ambiguous reference sample of five species, we explore the specific assignments of fragments obtained by a k-NN method of classification, artificially derived from the complete mandible. To describe the form of each piece we use 2D anatomical landmarks and sliding semilandmarks that allow the quantification of objects with no or few true anatomical landmarks. Results show that small fragments still possess species-specific information that is nearly always enhanced when using sliding-landmarks. Moreover, morpho-functional aspects are detected that can affect the species-specific information contained in the fragments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeozoology; Geometric morphometrics; Mammals; Species identification; Taphonomy","anatomy; archaeology; fragmentation; mammal; morphometry; taphonomy; zoology; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911059124

Osteological remains of iguanas are common in archaeological and paleontological deposits in the Lesser Antilles, however, and they could be important for understanding the past colonization processes of these two iguana species and subsequent sympatry. Unfortunately, although numerous questions exist about the past occurrence of those two species and their respective arrival dates, no osteological study has led to proper identification of subfossil iguana skeletal elements. Here we present a series of characters that allow for distinguishing the two species using isolated bones and emphasize the reliability of each recognized specific character. We also provide some comments about skeletal morphology of hybrids between both species and their identification based on osteology. © Copyright 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974624114

Here we present (I) a species classification rate for the two species using modern reference specimens, and (II) an application on archaeological vertebrae of Salmo sp. recovered from the cave of Le Taillis des Coteaux (Vienne, France). This cave contains a rich archaeological sequence with an exceptionally well preserved stratigraphy, encompassing the Upper Paleolithic from the Aurignacian to the Middle Magdalenian. To discriminate both species, we used a geometric morphometric approach to analyse vertebral form using landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks, coupled with k-Nearest Neighbour classification method. Other quantitative approaches like Principal Component Analyses exist, but the k-NN method increases the power of these analyses. Linear Discriminant Analysis was also used; however, the k-NN method provided better results. This study presents the initial results of geometric morphometric discrimination of European salmonid bones. The success rate of reassigning these to the modern reference specimens ranged from 84 to 100%, depending on the vertebrae studied, with the data indicating that S. trutta sspp. were the dominant taxon on site. This study provides clear evidence that vertebrae morphology can be used to differentiate salmonid species, allowing archaeological specimens, even partially broken, to be identified. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Geometric morphometrics; Le Taillis des Coteaux; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; Species identification; Upper Paleolithic; Vertebrae","archaeology; bioindicator; identification method; morphology; morphometry; Paleolithic; salmonid; taxonomy; France; Poitou-Charentes; Vienne; Salmo salar; Salmo sp.; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949036039

This has led to considerable debate regarding the taxonomic status of palaeontological and archaeological equid remains. The possible confounding impact of sex and age variation on analyses of archaeological equid remains has so far remained untested. This could be especially problematic when it is unknown whether an assemblage contains more than one equid species, breed or hybrid. Here, sex and age variation in modern equid species is examined and compared to variation in Pleistocene equid assemblages from northwest Europe. Sex variation in the longbones of modern equid species was found to be lower than variation over time. Similarly, age variation in dental elements of the same species is predominantly lower than diachronic variation, although caution needs to be taken when an archaeological assemblages consists mostly of elements at a similar wear stage. To assess whether late Middle Pleistocene caballoid horse fossils should be assigned to multiple species or be considered to form a monospecific group, the coefficients of variation for measurements on fossil horse remains were compared with those for modern equid specimens. Results indicate that the fossil assemblages are similarly variable to samples of modern material. Taken as a whole, the late Middle Pleistocene caballoid horse lineage is equally variable to an assemblage of modern ponies of a variety of different breeds. This implies that the variation observed between samples dating from different parts of the Middle Pleistocene can be characterised as intraspecific variation within a single species reflecting ecomorphological adaptations to the changeable Pleistocene climate. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Age variation; Equidae; Sexual dimorphism; Speciation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872973556
