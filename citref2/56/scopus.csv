Artificially deformed skulls display marked alterations of the cranial base. This study evaluates mandibular changes as function of the morphology of the cranial base in these skulls. Material and methods: A geometric morphometric study was performed on lateral cephalometric X-rays of three groups of skulls: 32 with anteroposterior deformity, 17 with circumferential deformity and 39 with no apparent deformity. Results: In artificially deformed skulls, the cranial base was deformed causing the mandibular condyle to be in a more anterior position. There was a complete remodelling of the mandible involving narrowing and elongation of the mandibular ramus, rotation of the corpus of the mandible and increased vertical height of the symphysis. Forward displacement did not occur. Integration between mandible and cranial base is not altered by deformation of the skull. Conclusions: Deformity of the cranial vault exerts an influence on the mandible, supporting the theory of modular units in complete integration. This also supports the theory that mandibular prognathism is a multifactorial result and not a direct effect of displacement of the cranial base. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
