The material on which the investigation is based consists of two series of standardized lateral head x-ray pictures of 243 individuals, who were first examined at the age of 12 and later subjected to a follow-up study at the age of 20. The investigation takes the form of a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of the individual growth changes within the cranial base during the growth period in question and the extent and manner in which these growth changes are coordinated with the development of the brain case and the facial development. Other questions that have been analyzed are the relation between variations in form and changes in form during the growth period and the relation between size and linear growth. The results of the investigation have been summarized as follows: 1. 1. The general growth pattern which has been calculated by comparing the mean values for the two stages of development, 12 and 20 years, shows that the cranial base is elongated ventrally by frontal apposition in the glabella region, without any appreciable longitudinal, sutural increment of the anterior cranial fossa. The dorsal elongation of the cranial base, in the medial region due to enchondral growth of the clivus, is accompanied by a dorsal displacement due to sutural growth of the lateral regions of the cranial base and the brain case, forming the median and the posterior cranial fossae and a simultaneous lowering of these regions in relation to the anterior cranial fossa. There is, on an average, an insignificant straightening of the cranial base and there is a virtually parallel lowering of foramen magnum (Fig. 4). 2. 2. The general growth pattern does not give any clue to the dynamic development, which becomes evident only through analysis of the individual growth patterns. Variations in the individual growth with age have been expressed through the standard deviations for the individual age changes (sD). The discussion includes the variation in the cranial base and face as a whole. 2.1. A. The individual variation in form with age (sD) is found definitely to be correlated with the range of variation in form (s12). The individual variations of the age changes in form of the cranial base and the facial structure between the ages of 12 and 20 amount roughly to 55 per cent of the variation in form at the age of 12 (Fig. 8, a). A similar relation is found to exist between the variation in linear increment (sD) and the variation in size (s12) (Fig. 8, b). 2.2. B. The individual age changes in form vary in magnitude irrespective of whether or not the average form for a given feature changes with age (Fig. 9, a). On the other hand, the average size increases with age in proportion to the variation in linear growth (Fig. 9, b). 2.3. C. The variation in form increases somewhat with age and in definite proportion to the individual variations in the growth changes (Fig. 10, a). The variation in size is also proportional to the variation in linear increment (Fig. 10, b). 2.4. D. A coordination in form or size also expresses a coordination of the individual age changes. 2.5. E. The relation between shape and its change with age in the bite departs in many ways from the corresponding relation in the facial structure and the cranial base. The reason for this is that the age changes within the bite are due largely to functional modifications that occur with age. 3. 3. The shape of the cranial base may be considered on an average, to remain stable with age. It shows, however, a marked individual variation with age as regards increased or diminished bending in individual cases; that is, it varies in either direction. 3.1. A. Rotation of the medial regions of the cranial base has for its center the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. This rotation is coordinated with a rotation due to sutural growth of the lateral regions of the cranial base and the brain case. 3.2. B. The shape of the brain case varies greatly in relation to the shape of the cranial base. A flattening of the cranial base usually has, as a result, a low brain case, the total height of which, measured from basion to bregma, is low. The radius of the brain case, measured from sella to bregma, is increased, however, and this is accompanied by a marked reduction in the radius, measured from sella to basion, causing the posterior and median cranial fossae to be raised in relation to the anterior one. Rotation of the cranial base and the brain case does not result, however, in any raising or lowering of the anterior cranial fossa. Foramen magnum is displaced backward and upward and the foramen angle increases, resulting in an upward tilt of the face (Fig. 11). The rotation of the cranial base seems not to be coordinated with the growth in width of the head and facial structure. 4. 4. In coordination with the rotation of the cranial base and the brain case, there is also a rotation of the facial structure. 4.1. A. The temporal bone, and hence the glenoid fossa, is displaced downward and forward or backward and upward as a result of the cranial base rotation and consequently brings about changes in the mandibular position. The direction of growth at the condyle will influence the general shape of the mandible. A more upward direction will increase the vertical height; a backward direction will increase the sagittal length. The size of the gonial angle will depend on the amount of condylar growth as well as on its direction in relation to the amount of appositional growth at the gonial angle (Fig. 14). 4.2. B. The body of the maxilla increases in length toward the palatine bone and is lowered as a result of the growth which occurs between the palatine bone and the pterygoid processes. In the individual this lowering may be forward and downward or rearward and downward, a variation in the growth direction of the maxilla which is coordinated with the cranial base rotation and with the sutural growth of the upper facial structure (Fig. 15). 5. 5. During the period of adolescence, the relation between the nasion-sella line and the deepest median contour of the anterior cranial fossa remains noticeably constant, whereas tuberculum sellae and dorsum sellae appear to be raised in relation to the center of the sella. For this reason, the n-s line appears to be particularly suitable as a reference line during the adolescent period in man. Its suitability as a reference line for investigations into earlier growth periods remains to be investigated. © 1955.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-50449134123

A model is presented for developmental interactions that occur during ontogeny between the brain and the cranial base and neurocranium, and between the neurobasicranial complex (NBC) and the face. The model is tested using exocranial and radiographic measurements of adult crania sampled from five geographically and craniometrically diverse populations. The results indicate that while variations in the breadth, length and flexion of the cranial base are mutually independent, only the maximum breadth of the cranial base (POB) has significant effects on overall cranial proportions, largely through its interactions with brain volume which influence NBC breadth. These interactions also have a slight influence on facial shape because NBC width constrains facial width, and because narrow-faced individuals tend to have antero-posteriorly longer faces relative to facial breadth than wide-faced individuals. Finally, the model highlights how integration between the cranial base and the brain may help to account for the developmental basis of some morphological variations such as occipital bunning. Among modern humans, the degree of posterior projection of the occipital bone appears to be a consequence of having a large brain on a relatively narrow cranial base. Occipital buns in Neanderthals, who have wide cranial bases relative to endocranial volume, may not be entirely homologous with the morphology occasionally evident in Homo sapiens.","Basicranium; Cranium; Integration; Neurocranium; Occipital bun; Skull","morphometry; skull; Crania; Hominidae; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034070524

Cephalometric conventions today may have little basis in either biology or biometrics. 2. 2. There is no theory of cephalometrics, only conventions which involve landmarks and straight lines only. These fail to capture the curving of form and its changes, exclude proper measures of size for bent structures, and misrepresent growth, portraying it as vector displacement rather than a generalized distortion. 3. 3. Conventional cephalometric procedures misinform by fabrication of misleading geometric quantities, by camouflage, particularly of remodeling, by confusion about what is happening (analysis of rotations, treating shape separately from size, and registering angles on landmarks as vertices), and by subtraction as a representation of growth. 4. 4. We suggest that the present systems offer little real hope of improvement sufficient to meet our needs in craniofacial growth research.

Two of these samples are artificially deformed (anteroposterior [AP] and circumferential [C] types). Measurements taken from lateral radiographs demonstrated that alternative forms of the cranial base angle (N‐S‐Ba, planum angle, planum sphenoidale to plane of the clivus and PANG angle, planum sphenoidale to basion‐sella plane) and the orbital and OANG angles (orbital roof to plane of the clivus and basion‐sella plane, respectively) of both deformed groups increased while the angle S‐Ba‐O decreased significantly with respect to the undeformed (N) sample. Changes in the AP group are largely due to anteroinferior displacement of the basion‐sella plane. Similar changes in group C are amplified by this group's posterosuperior frontal migration. This migration results in a relatively shallow orbit at the orbital plate/frontal squama interface. Unlike the deformation experienced by the external vault plates, the basion‐sella plane orientation remains stable with respect to the Frankfort Horizontal. Additionally, nasal region measurements such as maximum nasal aperture breadth and nasal height were largely stable between each deformed group and the undeformed group. However, facial (bimaxillary and bizygomatic), basicranial, cranial, and frontal breadths decreased significantly from group AP to group N to group C. Thus, gross morphological facial changes between each undeformed group and the control group are largely accounted for by dimensional changes in peripheral structures. These results stress the importance of the dynamic interrelationship between the cranial vault and base in the development of the craniofacial complex.

We test the hypothesis that fronto‐occipital artificial reshaping of the neurocranial vault results in specific changes in the cranial base and face. Fronto‐occipital reshaping results from the application of pads or a cradle board which constrains cranial vault growth, limiting growth between the frontal and occipital and allowing compensatory growth of the parietals in a mediolateral direction. Two skeletal series including both normal and artificially modified crania are analyzed, a prehistoric Peruvian Ancon sample (47 normal, 64 modified crania) and a Songish Indian sample from British Columbia (6 normal, 4 modified). Three‐dimensional coordinates of 53 landmarks were measured with a diagraph and used to form 9 finite elements as a prelude to finite element scaling analysis. Finite element scaling was used to compare average normal and modified crania and the results were evaluated for statistical significance using a bootstrap test. Fronto‐occipitally reshaped Ancon crania are significantly different from normal in the vault, cranial base, and face. The vault is compressed along an anterior‐superior to posterior‐inferior axis and expanded along a mediolateral axis in modified individuals. The cranial base is wider and shallower in the modified crania in the face is foreshortened and wider with the anterior orbital rim moving inferior and posterior towards the cranial base. The Songish crania display a different modification of the vault and face, indicating that important differences may exist in the morphological effects of fronto‐occipital reshaping from one group to another. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Details are given of the sequences of chondrification and ossification. Postnatal growth is approached in two ways--sagittal growth and transverse growth--involving detailed consideration of sutural growth and of resorptive expansion and remodeling in the whole base. New conclusions have been reached about the growth of the ethmoid, which continues for a longer time than was generally thought, and of its relation to orbital growth. The dependence of fossa growth upon the early, almost explosive growth of the brain is shown in the sequences of basicranial growth, with the maturation of the fossae in a rostrocaudal direction. Of all the suture systems affecting the base, the coronal ring is most important (with the spheno-occipital synchondrosis next in importance). An off-shoot of the coronal ring is noted, the pterygoid buttress, and its importance stressed in relation to maxillary and midface growth. These considerations of normal morphology are widened to explore the dysmorphologies of the nonsyndromic and syndromic craniosynostoses. The abnormal patterning of these synostoses is shown to lie partly in the common pathways of expressivity of the calvarial and basicranial suture systems, again particularly the coronal ring, and partly in the development and responsiveness of the bony units themselves, whether normal or hypoplastic, and of their soft-tissue matrices.",,"congenital malformation; craniofacial synostosis; embryology; growth, development and aging; histology; human; pathology; prenatal development; review; skull; syndrome; Craniosynostoses; Embryo and Fetal Development; Human; Skull; Syndrome",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026185098

Comparison of the means for occlusal groups showed a trend from class II to class III as cranial base dimensions and angle decreased. The condyle was also more distally positioned with respect to nasion, point A and the Pterygomaxillary vertical in the class II groups. Cranial base length correlated strongly with maxillary length but weakly with mandibular length. Nevertheless, the size of the maxilla did not influence its prognathism. The cranial base angle was strongly correlated (−0.7) with angle sella‐nasion‐point B. It is concluded that cranial base size and shape influence mandibular prognathism by determining the anteroposterior position of the condyle relative to the facial profile.

Integration, which is manifested as covariance among structures, enables the skull and associated soft tissues to maintain function both across ontogeny within individuals and across the ranges of size and shape variation among individuals. Integration also contributes to evolvability by structuring the phenotypic expression of genetic variation. We argue that the pattern of covariation seen in complex phenotypes such as the skull results from the overlaying of variation introduced by developmental and environmental factors at different stages of development. Much like a palimpsest, the covariation structure of an adult skull represents the summed imprint of a succession of effects, each of which leaves a distinctive covariation signal determined by the specific set of developmental interactions involved. Covariance evolves either by altering the variance of one of these sequential effects or through the introduction of a novel covariance producing effect. Either way is consistent with the notion that evolutionary change occurs through tinkering. We illustrate these principles through analyses of how genetic perturbations acting at different developmental stages (embryonic, fetal, and postnatal) influence the covariance structure of adult mouse skulls. As predicted by the model, the results illustrate the intimate relationship between the modulation of variance and the expression of covariance. The results also demonstrate that covariance patterns have a complex relationship to the underlying developmental architecture, thus highlighting problems with making inferences about developmental relationships (e.g. modularity) based on covariation.

These variations were in harmony with each other: the cranial base angle Ba-S-N closed and the legs S-N and S-Ba shortened systematically from Class II, over Class I, to Class III. The juvenile mandible notably was not systematically different. Because the cranial base provides the framework for the maxilla to be built upon, it is concluded that in juveniles the midface above anything else creates the characteristic difference between the three Angle classes, not the mandible.

This study determines deformations that contribute to a Class III cranial base morphology, employing thin-plate spline analysis on lateral cephalographs. A total of 73 children of European-American descent aged between 5 and 11 years of age with Class III malocclusion were compared with an equivalent group of subjects with a normal, untreated, Class I molar occlusion. The cephalographs were traced, checked and subdivided into seven age- and sex-matched groups. Thirteen points on the cranial base were identified and digitized. The datasets were scaled to an equivalent size, and statistical analysis indicated significant differences between average Class I and Class III cranial base morphologies for each group. Thin-plate spline analysis indicated that both affine (uniform) and non-affine transformations contribute toward the total spline for each average cranial base morphology at each age group analysed. For non-affine transformations, Partial warps 10, 8 and 7 had high magnitudes, indicating large-scale deformations affecting Bolton point, basion, pterygo-maxillare, Ricketts' point and articulare. In contrast, high eigenvalues associated with Partial warps 1-3, indicating localized shape changes, were found at tuberculum sellae, sella, and the frontonasomaxillary suture. It is concluded that large spatial-scale deformations affect the occipital complex of the cranial base and sphenoidal region, in combination with localized distortions at the frontonasal suture. These deformations may contribute to reduced orthocephalization or deficient flattening of the cranial base antero-posteriorly that, in turn, leads to the formation of a Class III malocclusion.",,"article; case control study; cephalometry; child; congenital malformation; craniofacial synostosis; female; human; male; malocclusion; maxillofacial development; methodology; preschool child; prognathia; radiography; reference value; skull base; Case-Control Studies; Cephalometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Craniosynostoses; Female; Humans; Male; Malocclusion, Angle Class III; Maxillofacial Development; Prognathism; Reference Values; Skull Base",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031204427

We analyze crania which have been fronto‐occipitally compressed to ascertain possible morphological effects on the mandible. We collected measures of mandibular breadth, length, and height from 82 modified (N = 48) and unmodified (N = 34) crania from a Peruvian Ancon series. Angle classification was also scored in order to investigate whether or not occlusal relationships were affected by neurocranial reshaping. Only intercondylar distance (posterior mandibular breadth) exhibited significant differences between unmodified and modified groups, though this difference was relatively small compared with vault deformation. The modified crania had a higher frequency of normal occlusion (Class I) than the unmodified crania. Increased intercondylar breadth in modified skulls is due to a cascade of effects which begin with a direct effect of the fronto‐occipital deforming device on neurocranial shape (increased neurocranial width). The increase in mandibular breadth may be a compensatory response to increased cranial base breadth and maintains articulation between the cranial base and mandible. The increased posterior breadth, coupled with a slight decrease in mandibular depth, may contribute to the change in occlusal relationships suggested for this sample.

The male and female subgroups were tested for differences in mean shapes and ontogenetic trajectories, and shape variability was characterized using principal component analysis. The hypothesis of modularity was tested for six different modularity scenarios. The results showed that there were subtle but significant differences in the male and female Procrustes mean shapes. Males were significantly larger. Mild sexual ontogenetic allometric divergence was noted. Principal component analysis indicated that, of the four retained biologically interpretable components, the two most important sources of variability were (i) vertical shape variation (i.e. dolichofacial vs. brachyfacial growth patterns) and (ii) sagittal relationships (maxillary prognatism vs. mandibular retrognathism, and vice versa).

Design: Twenty-nine 2D landmarks of the midline cranial base, the face and the mandible of dry skull X-rays from three major populations (45 Asians, 34 Africans, 64 Europeans) were digitized and analysed by geometric morphometrics. We used, first, MANOVA to test for mean shape differences between populations; then, principal components analysis (PCA) to assess the overall variation in the sample and finally, canonical variate analysis (CVA) with jack-knife validations (N = 1000) to analyse the anatomical features that best distinguished among populations. Results: Significant mean shapes differences were shown between populations (P < 0.001). CVA revealed two significant axes of discrimination (P < 0.001). Jack-knife validation correctly identified 92% of 15,000 unknowns. In Africans the whole cranial base is rotated into a forward-downward position, while in Asians it is rotated in the opposite way. The Europeans occupied an intermediate position. African and Asian samples showed a maxillo/mandibular prognathism. African prognathism was produced by an anterior positioned maxilla, Asian prognathism by retruded anterior cranial base and increase of the posterior cranial base length. Europeans showed a trend towards retracted mandibles with relatively shorter posterior cranial bases. Conclusions: The results supported the hypothesis that basicranial orientation and posterior cranial base length are valid factors to distinguish between geographic groups. The whole craniofacial configuration underlying a particular maxillo-facial disharmony must be considered in diagnosis, growth predictions and resulting treatment planning. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This indicates that the cranial base flexure may or may not have an effect on the degree of mandibular prognathism and classification of malocclusion. This study evaluates the correlation of the pretreatment cranial base angle and its component parts to other dental and skeletal cephalometric variables as well as treatment time. The sample consisted of 99 Angle Class II and Class I malocclusions treated in the mixed dentition with cervical headgear and incisor bite plane. Thirty of the patients required full appliance treatment. Treatment duration averaged 4.3 years (SD, 1.5 years). Only the starting cephalograms were used to acquire linear, proportional, and angular cranial base dimensions using Ba-S-N (total cranial base), Ba-S/FH (posterior cranial base), and SN/FH (anterior cranial base). Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were computed and used to assess the association of the following skeletal and dental variables: N-Pg/FH, MP/FH, Y-axis/FH, U1/L1, L1/MP, A-NPg mm, A-Perp, B-Perp, and treatment time with the cranial base measurements. Significance was determined only when the confidence level was P < .05. Although there was no significant correlation of BaSN or SN/FH with NPg, the angular BaS/FH, linear BaS mm, and proportional length of BaS %BaN were all statistically negatively correlated to the facial angle. This indicates that the posterior cranial base leg is the controlling factor in relating the cranial base to mandibular prognathism.","Correlation coefficients; Cranial base; Mandibular protrusion; Posterior cranial base leg; Treatment time","article; cephalometry; controlled study; correlation analysis; correlation coefficient; dentition; disease severity; evaluation; face; female; human; incisor; major clinical study; male; malocclusion; mandible; measurement; orthodontic device; patient; prognathia; sample; school child; skeleton; skull base; statistical analysis; time; Cephalometry; Child; Chin; Face; Female; Humans; Incisor; Male; Malocclusion, Angle Class I; Malocclusion, Angle Class II; Mandible; Maxillofacial Development; Orthodontic Appliances; Orthodontics, Corrective; Skull Base; Time Factors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3242673374

Radiographs of 335 children with Class II Division 1 malocclusion and 273 Class I controls were assessed. Radiographs were converted to x and y coordinate data, and 52 commonly used linear, angular, and coordinate axis measurements were made. Both the Class II Division 1 and the control groups were subdivided into 6 samples according to sex and skeletal age (10, 12, and 14 years ± 6 months; chronological age ranged from 8.5 to 15.5 years). The mean plots from the coordinate data for the Class I boys and girls at 14 years were superimposed over the mean plots for the 10-year-old groups, creating circumpubertal growth standards. The standards are supported by growth vector diagrams and other data and lead to the following conclusions: (1) boys and girls with Class I malocclusion differ distinctly from each other in the amount and the direction of circumpubertal growth; (2) radiographic composite standards are useful and accurate clinical tools to show mean dentofacial skeletal growth and change between 10 and 14 years of age; (3) compared with the controls, the maxillary dentition of girls with Class II Division 1 malocclusion grows more horizontally, the maxillary (but not the mandibular) incisors procline farther, and the mandible grows more horizontally; (4) compared with the controls, the midfacial convexity in Class II Division 1 boys is markedly increased, due to more horizontal growth at A-point and less horizontal growth at nasion and pogonion, and maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth are proclined farther; (5) angular measurements involving S, N, A-point, B-point, and Pog are useful only when the position of N is known; and (6) cranial base flexure bears no relationship to the development of Class II Division 1 malocclusion.",,"adolescent; article; case control study; cephalometry; child; cross-sectional study; female; human; male; malocclusion; maxillofacial development; pathophysiology; physiology; puberty; radiography; sexual development; Adolescent; Case-Control Studies; Cephalometry; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Malocclusion, Angle Class II; Maxillofacial Development; Puberty; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035513492

The purpose of this study was to investigate the morphologic characteristics of the cranial base in children with Class III malocclusion. Lateral cephalograms from 100 children with Class III malocclusion were compared with those from 100 subjects with normal occlusion. Ten landmarks on the cranial base were identified and digitized. Cephalometric assessment using seven angular and 18 linear measurements was performed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The results revealed that the greatest between-group differences occurred in the posterior cranial-base region. It was concluded that shortening and angular bending of the cranial base, and a diminished angle between the cranial base and mandibular ramus, may lead to Class III malocclusion associated with Class III facial morphology. The association between cranial-base morphology and other types of malocclusion needs clarification.

Two groups of untreated subjects were formed on the basis of a small and large cranial base angle N-S-Ar at the age of 5 years: the large cranial base angle group (n = 22) consisted of subjects with an N-S-Ar angle larger than 125° (mean, 128.1°), and the small cranial base angle group (n = 20) included subjects with an N-S-Ar angle of less than 120° (mean, 117.6°). Cephalometric data of the 2 groups were analyzed at subject ages 5 and 12 years. At both ages, the groups showed significant differences of the variables SNA, SNB, individualized ANB, and Y axis. The unadjusted ANB angle and the angle of convexity N-A-Pg were not significantly different between the 2 groups. According to the individualized norm of the ANB angle, subjects with a large cranial base angle in the primary dentition demonstrated a skeletal Class II tendency both at the initial observation and at the longitudinal follow-up. On the basis of cephalometric variables at 12 years of age, it was possible to classify 88.1% of the initial large and small cranial base angle individuals, indicating a constancy of the skeletal pattern during the longitudinal follow-up. The relationship between cranial base flexure and skeletal pattern of the jaws seems to be established before the age of 5 years.

Design Untreated adult subjects (n = 187) were grouped according to standard cephalometric criteria of vertical and sagittal relationships. Geometric morphometrics were used to test the null hypothesis that integration patterns between the mandible and its associated basicranial and upper midfacial counterparts would be similar among various vertical and sagittal facial patterns. Results The null hypothesis was rejected for vertical groups, because the dolicho- and brachyfacial subjects showed significantly different integration patterns, but was accepted for sagittal groups, which showed identical covariation patterns. The morphological integration between the cranium-face and mandible were similarly high in the three skeletal classes, which explained the similarly large covariance between the two structures (57.80% in Class II to 60% in Class III). Conclusions Dolicho- and brachi-facial subjects showed specific and different cranium-face and associated mandible configurations. The cranium-face configuration may have an important influence (∼60%) on the generation of sagittal (anteroposterior) skeletal malocclusions. The remaining morphological component of the skeletal malocclusion (∼40%) would be independent of this particular integration (PLS1) between the cranium-face and mandible. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Covariation; Facial pattern; Generalized linear model; Geometric morphometrics; Skeletal Class II-III-malocclusion","adult; analysis of variance; anatomic landmark; article; cephalometry; covariation; face; Facial pattern; female; Generalized linear model; geometric morphometrics; histology; human; male; malocclusion; mandible; methodology; radiography; regression analysis; Skeletal Class II, III-malocclusion; skull; Covariation; Facial pattern; Generalized linear model; Geometric morphometrics; Skeletal Class II, III-malocclusion; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Anatomic Landmarks; Cephalometry; Face; Female; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Male; Malocclusion; Mandible; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888303912

One hundred and twenty-two Japanese children aged 3-5 years with normal occlusion in the primary dentition were included in this investigation. To analyse the relationship between cranial base structure and maxillofacial components, the subjects were divided into three groups according to facial type (prognathic, orthognathic, or retrognathic) assessed by the magnitude of their NSAr angle (as cranial base angle). These categorized cephalometric profiles suggested that the antero-posterior location of the maxillofacial components corresponded to the NSAr angle. Factor analysis of cephalometric variables showed that the variation of maxillofacial components from the S-N line was strongly related to the cranial base angle. This normal range of morphological variation was distinguished from that of growth by the factor loadings. From these results, theoretical models of cephalometric profiles with normal occlusion were computed by linear regression analysis.

However, the effect on the mandible is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between anteroposterior cranial vault deformation and mandibular morphology. Methods: The study sample included 44 women's crania with intact faces and bases that were excavated from archaeological sites in the Azapa Valley in northern Chile. The crania were divided into anteroposterior deformation (AP) and undeformed (U) groups according to frontal, parietal, and occipital curvatures. The sizes of the cranial vault, middle face, and mandible were measured with calipers. Lateral cephalograms were taken and analyzed according to a conventional method. Results: Cranial base angle, bizygomatic breadth and upper facial height, bicondylar breadth, anterior breadth, and mandibular body length were significantly larger, and the mandibular angle was significantly smaller, in the AP group than in the U group. Conclusions: The anteroposteriorly shorter and wider cranial deformation caused by externally applied forces in infancy might affect the bone-remodeling process of the mandibular angle, leading to a smaller mandibular angle in adulthood. © 2006 American Association of Orthodontists.",,"American Indian; article; cephalometry; Chile; female; history; human; jaw disease; mandible; maxillofacial development; paleopathology; pathology; plagiocephaly; Cephalometry; Chile; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, South American; Mandible; Mandibular Diseases; Maxillofacial Development; Paleopathology; Plagiocephaly, Nonsynostotic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749642816

We have studied the influence of this deformation on maxillary and mandibular morphology. Measurements were performed on 86 adult Ancon skulls with anteroposterior deformation. Undeformed skulls from the area of Makatampu (n = 52) were used as the control group. To explore the influence of the deformity on occlusion, the skulls were categorized using the Angle classification and the alignment of the interincisor midline. In the group of deformed skulls, there was an increase in lateral growth of the vault and of the base of the skull (P < 0.001), giving rise to a greater interpterygoid width of the maxilla (P < 0.001), and an increase in the transverse diameter of the palatal vault. The mandible presented an increase in the length of the rami (P < 0.001) and in the intercondylar width, with no alteration of mandibular length. The deformed skulls had normal (class I) occlusion, with no displacement of the midline. The difference in the asymmetry index between the two groups was not statistically significant. Artificial fronto-occipital deformation of the cranial vault provoked compensatory lateral expansion of the base that was correlated with the transverse development of the maxilla and mandible. Occlusion and sagittal intermaxillary position were not affected by the cranial deformity. These results provide evidence of the integration between the neurocranium and the viscerocranium in craniofacial development, and support the hypothesis of a compensatory effect of function.
