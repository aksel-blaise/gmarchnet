These methods show differences in shape among specimens as residuals after rotation, translation, and scaling them so that they align as well as possible. A new method is presented that generalizes Siegel and Benson's (1982) resistant-fit theta-rho analysis so that more than two objects can be compared at the same time. Both least-squares and resistant-fit approaches are generalized to allow for affine transformations (uniform shape change). The methods are compared, using artificial data and data on 18 landmarks on the wings of 127 species of North American mosquitoes. Graphical techniques are also presented to help summarize the patterns of differences in shape among the objects being compared. © 1990 Society of Systematic Zoology.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860428591

Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.",,"ancestry; biological development; cognition; comparative study; divergence; gene expression; gene flow; genetic analysis; genome; metabolism; Neanderthal; selection; skeleton; Africa; African American; article; Asia; bone development; cognitive development; Europe; evolution; gene sequence; genetic variability; genome; human; human genome; metabolism; molecular evolution; plesiomorphy; priority journal; African Continental Ancestry Group; Animals; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Base Sequence; Bone and Bones; DNA, Mitochondrial; European Continental Ancestry Group; Evolution, Molecular; Extinction, Biological; Female; Fossils; Gene Dosage; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genome; Genome, Human; Haplotypes; Hominidae; Humans; Pan troglodytes; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time; Asia; Europe",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952136530

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

Most of this change has been due to the development and adoption of methods to analyze the Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks. These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

To clarify how and when these differences arise in ontogeny, we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Honto sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96 traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor the differences among the African apes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Their origin likely relates to an episode of recolonization of Western Eurasia by hominins of African origin carrying the Acheulean technology into Europe around 600 ka. An enhancement of both glacial and interglacial phases may have played a crucial role in this event, as well as in the subsequent evolutionary history of the Western Eurasian populations. In addition to climatic adaptations and an increase in encephalization, genetic drift seems to have played a major role in their evolution. To date, a clear speciation event is not documented, and the most likely scenario for the fixation of Neandertal characteristics seems to be an accretion of features along the second half of the MP. Although a separation time for the African and Eurasian populations is difficult to determine, it certainly predates OIS 11 as phenotypic Neandertal features are documented as far back as and possibly before this time. It is proposed to use the term ""Homo rhodesiensis"" to designate the large-brained hominins ancestral to H. sapiens in Africa and at the root of the Neandertals in Europe, and to use the term ""Homo neanderthalensis"" to designate all of the specimens carrying derived metrical or non-metrical features used in the definition of the LP Neandertals.","Acheulean; Climate; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Pleistocene","Africa; climate; Europe; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; genetic drift; hominid; Homo antecessor; homo erectus; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo neanderthalensis; homo sapiens; human; paleontology; phenotypic variation; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; review; species differentiation; Upper Pleistocene; animal; article; classification; fossil; histology; methodology; physical anthropology; population dynamics; time; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Africa; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Europe; Evolution; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349482681

Our sample consists of 38 crania: 20 modern adult Homo sapiens, 14 subadult H. sapiens, and four archaic Homo. All specimens were CT-scanned except for two infant H, sapiens, who were imaged by MR instead. For each specimen 84 landmarks and semilandmarks were located on the midsagittal plane and converted to Procrustes shape coordinates. Integration was quantified by the method of singular warps, a new geometric-statistical approach to visualizing correlations among regions. The two classic patterns of integration, evolutionary and ontogenetic, were jointly explored by comparing analyses of overlapping subsamples that span ranges of different hypothetical factors. Evolutionary integration is expressed in the subsample of 24 adult Homo, and ontogenetic integration in the subsample of 34 H. sapiens. In this data set, vault, cranial base, and face show striking and localized patterns of covariation over ontogeny, similar but not identical to the patterns seen over evolution. The principal differences between ontogeny and phylogeny pertain to the cranial base. There is also a component of cranial to height ratio not reducible to either process. Our methodology allows a separation of these independent processes (and their impact on cranial shape) that conventional methods have not found. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results of these analyses are used to interpret the femoral morphology of three pre‐Recent Homo juveniles—the H. erectus KNM‐WT 15000 and the archaic H. sapiens La Ferrassie 6 and Teshik‐Tash 1—as well as observed differences in postcranial morphology between adult Recent and earlier Homo (Ruff et al., 1993). Our findings indicate the following: (1) There are age‐related changes in long‐bone diaphyseal envelope sensitivity to increased mechanical loading, with the periosteal envelope more responsive prior to mid‐adolescence, and the endosteal envelope more responsive thereafter. The periosteal expansion and endosteal contraction of the diaphysis documented earlier for adult pre‐Recent Homo relative to Recent humans (Ruff et al., 1993) is thus consistent with a developmental response to increased mechanical loading applied throughout life. The relatively large medullary cavity in the 11–12‐year‐old KNM‐WT 15000 femur is also consistent with this model. However, the two archaic H. sapiens juveniles show relatively small medullary cavities, possibly indicating a modified developmental pattern in this group. (2) Articulations follow a growth pattern similar to that of long‐bone length (and stature), while cross‐sectional diaphyseal dimensions (cortical area, second moments of area) show a contrasting growth pattern, with slower initial growth from childhood through mid‐adolescence, followed by a “catch‐up” period that continues through early adulthood. This latter pattern is more similar to the growth curve for body weight, and may in fact partially reflect adaptation of the diaphysis to increased weight bearing. Because of these different growth patterns, articulations appear relatively large, and diaphyseal breadths relatively small during late childhood to mid‐adolescence (i.e., about 9–13 years), when compared to adults from the same population. KNM‐WT 15000 shows this same proportional difference from adult early Homo specimens, which is therefore interpreted as simply a developmental consequence of his age at death. (3) When standardized for differences in body size and shape, midshaft femoral cross‐sectional areas for the three pre‐Recent juveniles in our sample, which span an age range from about 4 to 12 years, all fall in the upper part of the general data scatter for modern juveniles of a similar age. This is very similar to the pattern we found earlier for adult Homo specimens (Ruff et al., 1993). Thus, increased diaphyseal robusticity relative to modern humans, and the mechanicalhehavioral factors that produced this structural difference, were apparently as characteristic of immature as of adult pre‐Recent Homo. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

The tests require novel statistical and geometrical analyses of the Procrustes shape manifold.

Internally this area of the skull has been considerably less well-studied. Here we present results from a comparison of interior, as well as exterior, frontal bone profiles from CT scans of five mid-Pleistocene and Neanderthal crania and 16 modern humans. Analysis was by a new morphometric method, Procrustes analysis of semi-landmarks, that permits the statistical comparison of curves between landmarks. As expected, we found substantial external differences between archaic and modern samples, differences that are mainly confined to the region around the brow ridge. However, in the inner median-sagittal profile, the shape remained remarkably stable over all 21 specimens. This implies that no significant alteration in this region has taken place over a period of a half-million years or more of evolution, even as considerable external change occurred within the hominid clade spanning several species. This confirms that the forms of the inner and outer aspects of the human frontal bone are determined by entirely independent factors, and further indicates unexpected stability in anterior brain morphology over the period during which modern human cognitive capacities emerged.","Comparative anatomy; Computed tomography; Frontal bone; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Human evolution; Human fossil; Imaging; Neanderthals; Procrustes analysis","anthropometry; brain; cognition; comparative anatomy; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic imaging; evolution; fossil; frontal bone; human; morphometrics; priority journal; review; skull; statistics; Biometry; Frontal Bone; Humans",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033572638

Analyses of incremental features in teeth provide an accurate means of assessing the age at death of developing dentitions, facilitating direct comparisons with fossil and modern humans. It is currently unknown when and where the prolonged modern human developmental condition originated. Here, an application of x-ray synchrotron microtomography reveals that an early Homo sapiens juvenile from Morocco dated at 160,000 years before present displays an equivalent degree of tooth development to modern European children at the same age. Crown formation times in the juvenile's macrodont dentition are higher than modern human mean values, whereas root development is accelerated relative to modern humans but is less than living apes and some fossil hominins. The juvenile from Jebel Irhoud is currently the oldest-known member of Homo with a developmental pattern (degree of eruption, developmental stage, and crown formation time) that is more similar to modern H. sapiens than to earlier members of Homo. This study also underscores the continuing importance of North Africa for understanding the origins of human anatomical and behavioral modernity.

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We analysed the enamel extension rate in Homo antecessor (8 teeth analysed), Homo heidelbergensis (106), Homo neanderthalensis ('Neanderthals'; 146) and Upper Palaeolithic-Mesolithic Homo sapiens (100). Here we report that Upper Palaeolithic-Mesolithic H. sapiens shared an identical dental development pattern with modern humans, but that H. antecessor and H. heidelbergensis had shorter periods of dental growth. Surprisingly, Neanderthals were characterized by having the shortest period of dental growth. Because dental growth is an excellent indicator of somatic development, our results suggest that Neanderthals developed faster even than their immediate ancestor, H. heidelbergensis. Dental growth became longer and brain size increased from the Plio-Pleistocene in hominid evolution. Neanderthals, despite having a large brain, were characterized by a short period of development.

High-resolution micro-computed tomography now allows us to image complex structures and uncover subtle differences in adult tooth morphology that are determined early in embryonic development.

In contrast, great apes wean later, reproduce earlier, and have longer intervals between births. Despite 80 y of speculation, the origins of these developmental patterns in Homo sapiens remain unknown. Because they record daily growth during formation, teeth provide important insights, revealing that australopithecines and early Homo had more rapid ontogenies than recent humans. Dental development in later Homo species has been intensely debated, most notably the issue of whether Neanderthals and H. sapiens differ. Here we apply synchrotron virtual histology to a geographically and temporally diverse sample of Middle Paleolithic juveniles, including Neanderthals, to assess tooth formation and calculate age at death from dental microstructure. We find that most Neanderthal tooth crowns grew more rapidly than modern human teeth, resulting in significantly faster dental maturation. In contrast, Middle Paleolithic H. sapiens juveniles show greater similarity to recent humans. These findings are consistent with recent cranial and molecular evidence for subtle developmental differences between Neanderthals and H. sapiens.

Factors or processes affecting morphology only locally may respond to selection more easily than common factors that may lead to deleterious side effects and hence are expected to be more conserved. We briefly review evidence for such global factors in primate cranial development as well as for local factors constrained to either the face or the neurocranium. In a sample comprising 157 crania of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla, we statistically estimated common and local factors of shape variation from Procrustes coordinates of 347 landmarks and semilandmarks. Common factors with pleiotropic effects on both the face and the neurocranium account for a large amount of shape variation, but mainly by extension or truncation of otherwise conserved developmental pathways. Local factors (modular shape characteristics) have more degrees of freedom for evolutionary change than mere ontogenetic scaling. Cranial shape is similarly integrated during development in all three species, but human evolution involves dissociation among several characteristics. The dissociation has probably been achieved by evolutionary alterations and by the novel emergence of local factors affecting characteristics that are controlled at the same time by the common factors. © 2008 The Author(s).","Craniofacial growth; Factor analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Heterochrony; Human evolution; Morphological integration; Partial least squares","cranium; factor analysis; heterochrony (ontogeny); hominid; human evolution; morphology; morphometry; pleiotropy; selection; animal; article; evolution; female; gorilla; growth, development and aging; histology; human; male; Pan troglodytes; skull; Animals; Evolution; Female; Gorilla gorilla; Humans; Male; Pan troglodytes; Skull; Crania; Gorilla gorilla; Hominoidea; Homo sapiens; Pan troglodytes; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41749124131

Whereas studies of modularity often are experimental, morphological integration is a more descriptive concept applying to groups of correlated phenotypic characters. Using simple path models, this paper shows that the classic underlying assumption of modularity (high correlations within modules, lower correlations between modules) is met only when local developmental factors have high effects on the traits relative to all factors' variations of effect (i.e., allometry). Accordingly, many classic approaches to morphological integration are meaningful only when local as well as common growth factors are nearly isometric. We show that morphometric modules might instead be defined more generally as sets of variables with non-zero within-module covariances, even when the covariances due to common factors have been removed, so that the residual between-module covariances are all near zero. Although it is still inherently unreliable to identify modules from phenotypic covariances in nonexperimental data, patterns of integration can sometimes be estimated based on prior identification of the modules themselves. We outline a simple approach for this case using Wright-style factor analysis and demonstrate the relation of its algebra to the more familiar approach via partial least squares.

Though principal component (PC) plots of multivariate shape data seem to resemble classical bivariate allometric plots, the language of heterochrony cannot be translated directly into general multivariate methodology. We simulate idealized multivariate ontogenetic trajectories and explore their appearance in PC plots of shape space and size-shape space. Only if the trajectories of two related species lie along exactly the same path in shape space can the classic terminology of heterochrony apply and pure dissociation of size change against shape change be detected. Regional heterochrony - the variation of apparent heterochrony by region - implies a dissociation of local growth fields and cannot be identified in an overall PC analysis. We exemplify a geometric morphometric approach to these issues using adult and subadult crania of 48 Pan paniscus and 47 Pan troglodytes specimens.

Likewise, because comparative fossil evidence is scarce, when and how the modern human pattern of brain growth arose during evolution is largely unknown. Virtual reconstructions of a Neanderthal neonate from Mezmaiskaya Cave (Russia) and of two Neanderthal infant skeletons from Dederiyeh Cave (Syria) now provide new comparative insights: Neanderthal brain size at birth was similar to that in recent Homo sapiens and most likely subject to similar obstetric constraints. Neanderthal brain growth rates during early infancy were higher, however. This pattern of growth resulted in larger adult brain sizes but not in earlier completion of brain growth. Because large brains growing at high rates require large, late-maturing, mothers [Leigh SR and Blomquist GE (2007) in Campbell CJ et al.

It aims to establish the extent to which the distinctive features of adult representatives of these populations are present in the early post natal period and to what extent population differences in ontogenetic scaling and allometric trajectories contribute to distinct facial forms. The analyses utilize configurations of facial landmarks and are carried out using geometric morphometric methods. The results of this study show that modern human populations can be distinguished based on facial shape alone, irrespective of age or sex, indicating the early presence of differences. Additionally, some populations have statistically distinct facial ontogenetic trajectories that lead to the development of further differences later in ontogeny. We conclude that population-specific facial morphologies develop principally through distinctions in facial shape probably already present at birth and further accentuated and modified to variable degrees during growth. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the plasticity of facial growth patterns in modern humans. Further, they have important implications in relation to the study of growth in the face of fossil hominins and in relation to the possibility of developing effective discriminant functions for the identification of population affinities of immature facial skeletal material. Such tools would be of value in archaeological, forensic and anthropological applications. The findings of this study underline the need to examine more deeply, and in more detail, the ontogenetic basis of other causes of craniometric variation, such as sexual dimorphism and hominin species differentiation.","Allometric vectors; Craniofacial variation; Facial ontogeny","adolescent; adult; allometry; anthropology; archeology; article; controlled study; craniofacial development; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; face; face growth; facial bone; female; forensic medicine; fossil; geometry; human; human experiment; male; normal human; perinatal period; plasticity; population differentiation; population research; priority journal; sex difference; species differentiation; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Continental Population Groups; Facial Bones; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maxillofacial Development; Morphogenesis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036737886

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549154351

This result is in agreement with an independent assessment of the age of the temporal bone of this specimen (Tillier, AM [1982] Z. Morphol.

Sexual dimorphism in shape and form is already present at the earliest age stage included in the analysis. However, the nature of dimorphism changes with age. Four factors apper to contribute to cranial sexual dimorphism in human postnatal development: 1) initial, possibly prenatal, differences in shape; 2) differences in the association of size and shape; 3) male hypermorphosis; and 4) some degree of difference in the direction of male and female growth trajectories. Studying changes in individuals, we find a low correlation between newborn and adult morphology, while 3-year-olds already show a high correlation with their adult form.

The study of dental development facilitates assessment of growth and development in fossil hominins with greater precision than other skeletal analyses. During tooth formation, biological rhythms manifest in enamel and dentine, creating a permanent record of growth rate and duration. Quantification of these internal and external incremental features yields developmental benchmarks, including ages at crown completion, tooth eruption, and root completion. Molar eruption is correlated with other aspects of life history. Recent evidence for developmental differences between modern humans and Neanderthals remains ambiguous. By measuring tooth formation in the entire dentition of a juvenile Neanderthal from Scladina, Belgium, we show that most teeth formed over a shorter time than in modern humans and that dental initiation and eruption were relatively advanced. By registering manifestations of stress across the dentition, we are able to present a precise chronology of Neanderthal dental development that differs from modern humans. At 8 years of age at death, this juvenile displays a degree of development comparable with modern human children who are several years older. We suggest that age at death in juvenile Neanderthals should not be assessed by comparison with modern human standards, particularly those derived from populations of European origin. Moreover, evidence from the Scladina juvenile and other similarly aged hominins suggests that a prolonged childhood and slow life history are unique to Homo sapiens. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Hominin; Human evolution; Life history; Ontogeny; Tooth growth","article; Belgium; biological rhythm; dentin; enamel; evolution; fossil; human; life history; molar tooth; Paleolithic; priority journal; tooth development; tooth eruption; Animals; Belgium; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Life; Odontogenesis; Paleodontology; Tooth; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-38049186656

In this study, we use virtual endocasts to provide a detailed description of shape changes during human postnatal ontogeny with geometric morphometric methods. Using CT scans of 108 dried human crania ranging in age from newborns to adults and several hundred landmarks and semi-landmarks, we find that the endocranial ontogenetic trajectory is curvilinear with two bends, separating three distinct phases of shape change. We test to what extent endocranial shape change is driven by size increase and whether the curved ontogenetic trajectory can be explained by a simple model of modular development of the endocranial base and the endocranial vault. The hypothesis that endocranial shape change is driven exclusively by brain growth is not supported; we find changes in endocranial shape after adult size has been attained and that the transition from high rates to low rates of size increase does not correspond to one of the shape trajectory bends. The ontogenetic trajectory of the endocranial vault analyzed separately is nearly linear; the trajectory of the endocranial base, in contrast, is curved. The endocranial vault therefore acts as one developmental module during human postnatal ontogeny. Our data suggest that the cranial base comprises several submodules that follow their own temporally and/or spatially disjunct growth trajectories. © Journal compilation © 2009 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Brain; Endocranium; Geometric morphometrics; Ontogeny; Semi-landmarks; Virtual endocasts","adolescent; adult; article; brain cortex; brain development; brain growth; brain size; child; computer assisted tomography; computer interface; controlled study; dura mater; human; human tissue; methodology; morphometrics; newborn; ontogeny; priority journal; skull; three dimensional imaging; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Brain; Cephalometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Models, Anatomic; Skull; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult; Crania; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249217996

It encompasses the posterior projection/convexity of the occipital squama and is associated with lambdoid flattening on the parietal. A 'hemibun' in some Upper Paleolithic Europeans is thought by some authors to indicate interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern Europeans. However, 'bunning' is difficult to measure, and the term has been applied to a range of morphological patterns. Furthermore, its usefulness in phylogenetic reconstruction and its homologous status across modern and fossil humans have been disputed. We present a geometric morphometric study that quantitatively evaluates the chignon, assesses its usefulness in separating Neanderthals from modern humans, and its degree of similarity to Upper Paleolithic 'hemibuns.' We measured the three-dimensional coordinates of closely spaced points along the midsagittal plane from bregma to inion and of anatomical landmarks in a large series of recent human crania and several Middle and Late Pleistocene European and African fossils. These coordinate data were processed using the techniques of geometric morphometrics and analyzed with relative warps, canonical variates, and singular warps. Our results show no separation between Neanderthals and modern humans, including early modern Europeans, when the shape of the occipital plane midsagittal-profile is considered alone. On the other hand, Neanderthals are well separated from both recent and fossil modern humans when information about the occipital's relative position and relative size are also included. Furthermore, the occurrence of a highly convex and posteriorly projecting midline occipital profile (interpreted as the occipital bun) is highly correlated (>0.8) with a flat parietal midsagittal profile and with antero-superiorly positioned temporal bones across both our recent and our fossil human samples. We conclude that the shape of the occipital profile alone should not be considered an independent trait, as it is very tightly integrated with braincase shape. Our analysis does not support differences in integration of the posterior midsagittal profile and the cranial base in Pleistocene and recent humans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Endocranial shape is already distinct at birth and there is no overlap between the two species throughout ontogeny. While some aspects of the pattern of endocranial shape change are shared between humans and chimpanzees, the shape trajectories differ substantially directly after birth until the eruption of the deciduous dentition: in humans but not in chimpanzees, the parietal and cerebellar regions expand relatively (contributing to neurocranial globularity) and the cranial base flexes within the first postnatal year when brain growth rates are high.

In this discussion, there has been a dearth of attention of the degree to which modern humans are derived relative to earlier members of the genus Homo. Of 75 cranial, mandibular, dental, axial, and appendicular traits in which the Neandertals and/or modern humans are derived relative to Early and Middle Pleistocene Homo, approximately one-quarter are shared among Neandertals and modern humans, a similar percentage largely unique to the Neandertals, and about half largely unique to modern humans. The results are similar whether the Neandertals are compared with the earliest modern humans or with their Late Pleistocene and more recent modern human successors. Even though these figures could shift modestly through variation in trait selection and/or as a result of a more complete earlier Pleistocene Homo fossil record, it is apparent that modern humans are morphologically more derived than the Neandertals. Our focus should therefore be at least as much on the evolutionary biology of early and recent modern humans as on that of the Neandertals. © 2006 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

In humans, vertical facial variation is among the main sources of diversity and frequently associated with an integrated suite of other cranio-mandibular traits. Facial heights and kyphosis are also important factors in interspecific variation and models of hominoid evolution. The ontogenetic determination of adult facial orientation and its relation to phylogenetic variation are unclear, but crucial in all previously mentioned respects. We addressed these issues in a sample of 175 humans and chimpanzees with Procrustes based geometric morphometrics, testing hypotheses of interspecific similarity in postnatal ontogenetic trajectories, early versus later ontogenetic facial pattern determination, and a developmental model of morphological integration. We analyzed the contribution of postnatal morphogenesis to adult vertical facial variation by partitioning morphological variation into a portion of pure growth allometry and a non-allometric fraction. A statistically significant difference of growth-allometries revealed that in both species growth established the adult skull proportions by vertical facial expansion, but while in chimpanzees the complete viscerocranium showed reorientation, in humans only the lower face was modified. In both species the results support a hypothesis of early facial pattern determination. A coincident emergence of morphological traits favors a hypothesis of developmental integration of the face, excluding traits of the basi- and neurocranium. Interspecific differences in integration may have implications for evolutionary studies. The present findings indicate that growth establishes the adult skull proportions and integrates principal facial orientation patterns, already there in early postnatal ontogeny. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this question, this investigation compares the duration of enamel formation in Neandertals with that of three comparative modern human groups. Because dental and somatic growth are correlated with each other, dental growth periods are indicative of overall periods of growth. Growth increments on the anterior teeth of Neandertals, modern Inuit, and modern people from Newcastle and southern Africa were counted and their means compared. In addition, potential variation in the time spans represented by growth increments was considered and incorporated into the analysis of enamel formation times. These analyses show that Neandertal imbricational enamel formation times, although likely to have been faster than those of the Inuit, are not likely to have been faster than those of the Newcastle sample and for some teeth are clearly slower than those of the southern African sample.

In order to account for these structures, biomechanical interpretations in terms of masticatory stress and the effects of structural constraints have been put forward. This paper examines the multivariate relationships between robusticity and cranial dimensions in modern humans through canonical correlation and principal components analyses. These analyses reveal a very significant association between robusticity and cranial size, by which the larger the size of the skull, the greater the development of the cranial superstructures. In this context, size is biased towards maximum cranial length, various measures of upper facial breadth, basion-nasion length and palato-dental size. A statistically less important relationship between robusticity and cranial shape reveals that there are two main circumstances in which a modern skull will develop superstructures, in either very large crania, independent of the breadth of the vault, or in very narrow ones with large teeth. The cranial superstructures are not only strongly influenced by certain cranial dimensions, but are inter-correlated in their expression. These morphological features should not be treated as independent phylogenetic traits. The majority of recent crania are relatively small and gracile, clearly the result of a common temporal trend in the evolution of modern human cranial diversity. Although not unique in their level of robusticity among recent human groups, Australian aboriginals are the only population to show a relationship between robusticity and cranial breadth. It is suggested that the total morphological pattern observed in Australia does not reflect a plesio-morphic condition, but the specific history of occupation of that continent favouring size reduction with the maintenance of robusticity. Finally, it is shown that most early modern fossils are comparatively large and robust. It is suggested that the definition of a modern cranial form should be disassociated from the concept of gracility, only observed in some recent human populations. © 1996 Academic Press Limited.","Canonical correlation analysis; Cranial robusticity; Modern humans; Multivariate analysis; Principal components analysis; Regional patterns","Crania; Homo sapiens; cranial shape; cranial size; cranium; Homo sapiens; robusticity; statistical analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030449383

Such adult shape differences must ultimately be rooted in different developmental patterns, but it is unclear at which point during ontogeny these group characteristics emerge.Here we compared internal shape changes of the braincase from birth to adulthood in Neandertals (N=10), modern humans (N=62), and chimpanzees (N=62). Incomplete fossil specimens, including the two Neandertal newborns from Le Moustier 2 and Mezmaiskaya, were reconstructed using reference-based estimation methods. We used 3D geometric morphometrics to statistically compare shapes of virtual endocasts extracted from computed-tomographic scans. Throughout the analysis, we kept track of possible uncertainties due to the missing data values and small fossil sample sizes.We find that some aspects of endocranial development are shared by the three species. However, in the first year of life, modern humans depart from this presumably ancestral pattern of development. Newborn Neandertals and newborn modern humans have elongated braincases, and similar endocranial volumes. During a 'globularization-phase' modern human endocasts change to the globular shape that is characteristic for Homo sapiens. This phase of early development is unique to modern humans, and absent from chimpanzees and Neandertals.Our results support the notion that Neandertals and modern humans reach comparable adult brain sizes via different developmental pathways. The differences between these two human groups are most prominent directly after birth, a critical phase for cognitive development. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Brain evolution; Endocast; Geometric morphometrics; Le Moustier 2; Mezmaiskaya; Procrustes; Semilandmarks","brain; cognition; cranium; estimation method; fossil record; morphometry; Neanderthal; ontogeny; three-dimensional modeling; Adygea; Mezmaiskaya Cave; Russian Federation; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Pan",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856549547

Abascal 2, 28006 Madrid, Spain","Analysis of variation and distribution of evolutionary novelties is meaningful in understanding evolutionary processes. The mandible, as a morphological complex, comprises a large number of derived Neanderthal features. The present study investigates whether the features usually considered as European lineage apomorphies evolved independently; the occurrence of these features is studied in the mandibles from the Sima de los Huesos (SH) site (Atapuerca, Spain). For comparative purposes, a large sample of Neanderthal mandibles as well as older fossil Homo specimens have been used for the study. Chi-square tests were employed to test for independence. The SH mandibles present a set of features that clearly show the basic architecture of the Neanderthal mandible. A highly significant association is detected in the variation of the position of the mental foramen, the lateral prominence, and the anterior marginal tubercle, as well as in the development of retromolar space. However, a much weaker association is detected in the features of the internal aspect of the mandible, with a few exceptions. Features of the external aspect of the mandible occur chronologically earlier than those observed in the internal aspect. The hypothesis that two distinct and consecutive morphological processes have driven the emergence of the European lineage throughout the Middle Pleistocene is proposed. A first transformation affects the mandible by means of backwards displacement of the structures located at the external aspect, as well as the position of the condyle. A second process would modify the features of the internal aspect of the mandible, in which the relief of the masseteric and pterygoid fossae are affected, in association with a spatial rearrangement of the corpus and ramus. Analyzed individually, some of the considered features may be questioned as Neanderthal apomorphies (Trinkaus,1993; Franciscus and Trinkaus, 995); however, the joint occurrence of many of them suggests that the complex is an evolutionary novelty. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Apomorphy; Atapuerca; Mandible; Variability","article; evolution; fossil; mandible; masseter muscle; masticatory muscle; morphology; physical anthropology; Spain; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Evolution; Female; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Male; Mandible; Spain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035167418

In contrast, other studies point to divergences in postnatal shape trajectories within diverse groups of primates. As such there is some debate regarding the relative contributions of pre and postnatal ontogeny to adult morphological differences. This paper presents a series of geometric morphometric studies of the ontogeny of facial shape in hominins with the specific aim of resolving these issues. The results indicate that many differences in facial shape between hominins are established prenatally, however highly significant divergences of postnatal facial ontogeny are found among living hominins. Our studies point to possible differences between the shape ontogeny of the Australopithecus africanus face and that of African apes on the one hand and humans on the other. However, sampling experiments indicate that the small sample size of available specimens of A. africanus does not permit any conclusions to be drawn regarding comparative shape ontogeny of the face. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"Australopithecus; Australopithecus africanus; Pan (ape); Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042761101

But the cross-sectional covariance matrix arises from the joint variation of a large range of developmental processes and hence is not constant over the period during which a population of developing organisms is actually exposed to selection. To examine how development shapes the phenotypic covariance structure, we ordinate the age-specific covariance matrices of shape coordinates for craniofacial growth in rats and humans. The metric that we use for this purpose is given by the square root of the summed squared log relative eigenvalues. This is the natural metric on the space of positive-definite symmetric matrices, which we introduce and justify in a biometric context. In both species, the covariance matrices appear to change continually throughout the full period of postnatal development. The resulting ontogenetic trajectories alter their direction at major changes of the developmental programs whereas they are fairly straight in between. Consequently, phenotypic covariance matrices - and thus also response to selection - should be expected to vary both over ontogenetic and phylogenetic time scales as different phenotypes are necessarily produced by different developmental pathways. © 2009 The Author(s).","Craniofacial growth; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological integration; Riemannian metric; Space of covariance matrices","cranium; eigenvalue; evolutionary theory; hominid; morphometry; ontogeny; phenotype; phylogenetics; rodent; selection; animal; article; biological model; evolution; growth, development and aging; histology; human; maxillofacial development; rat; skull; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Maxillofacial Development; Models, Genetic; Rats; Skull; Rattus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-60849096951

This study reexamines the issue by comparing the ontogeny of cranial shape in cross-sectional samples of bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) using both internal and external 3D landmarks digitized from CT scans. Geometric morphometric methods were used to quantify shape and size; dental-maturation criteria were used to estimate relative dental age. Heterochrony was evaluated using combined size-shape (allometry) and shape-age relationships for the entire cranium, the face, and the braincase. These analyses indicate that the bonobo skull is paedomorphic relative to the chimpanzee for the first principal component of size-related shape variation, most likely via a mechanism of postformation (paedomorphosis due to initial shape underdevelopment). However, the results also indicate that not all aspects of shape differences between the two species, particularly in the face, can be attributed to heterochronic transformation and that additional developmental differences must also have occurred during their evolution. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Questions regarding the evolution of brain development and obstetric constraints in the human lineage can be addressed with accurate estimates of the size of the brain at birth in hominins. Previous estimates of brain size at birth in fossil hominins have been calculated from regressions of neonatal body or brain mass to adult body mass, but this approach is problematic for two reasons: modern humans are outliers for these regressions, and hominin adult body masses are difficult to estimate. To accurately estimate the brain size at birth in extinct human ancestors, an equation is needed for which modern humans fit the anthropoid regression and one in which the hominin variable entered into the regression equation has limited error. Using phylogenetically sensitive statistics, a resampling approach, and brain-mass data from the literature and from National Primate Research Centers on 362 neonates and 2802 adults from eight different anthropoid species, we found that the size of the adult brain can strongly predict the size of the neonatal brain (r2 = 0.97). This regression predicts human brain size, indicating that humans have precisely the brain size expected as an adult given the size of the brain at birth. We estimated the size of the neonatal brain in fossil hominins from a reduced major axis regression equation using published cranial capacities of 89 adult fossil crania. We suggest that australopiths gave birth to infants with cranial capacities that were on average 180 cc (95% CI: 158-205 cc), slightly larger than the average neonatal brain size of chimpanzees. Neonatal brain size increased in early Homo to 225 cc (95% CI: 198-257 cc) and in Homo erectus to approximately 270 cc (95% CI: 237-310 cc). These results have implications for interpreting the evolution of the birth process and brain development in all hominins from the australopiths and early Homo, through H. erectus, to Homo sapiens. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the specimen has been assigned to each group or seen as bridging them, we have re-examined its morphological affinities relative to these two samples, as well as to European samples of later Pleistocene hominids. This has been done with respect to posterior corporeal and ramal discrete traits, symphyseal morphology, and proportional morphometric patterns along the dental arcade. Taking within and between sample ranges of variation into account, the lateral corporeal and ramal discrete characters are either ambiguous or suggest Neandertal affinities. Anterior symphyseal morphology is largely unknown, but a mentum osseum is indicated by a moderate incisura mandibulare anterior, and the tuber symphyseos did not extent superiorly toward the alveoli, a non-modern arrangement. The lingual symphysis presents the largest planum alveolare known for a Near Eastern Middle Paleolithic hominid. Morphometric analysis of proportions along the dental arcade separate Tabun 2 from Near Eastern and European early modern humans and palce it among the late archaic humans. It is dentally closest to the Near Eastern late archaic human lineage and the Krapina sample. These analyses therefore indicate that it is best seen as part of the Near Eastern late archaic human lineage with only the mentum osseum and incisure shape indicating any approach to the Qafzeh-Skhul humans within the Near Eastern Middle Paleolithic.",,"evolution; hominid; mandible; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; Animalia; Hominidae; Incisura; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032071335

Evidence for such admixture must be sought in the earliest fossil record of modern humans outside Africa, as it is those populations that would have encountered, and possibly interbred with, archaic hominins. In the case of Europe, the recent application of direct dating techniques has eliminated several specimens from the Upper Paleolithic fossil record, while confirming early ages for others. Among these earliest reliably dated specimens is the Cioclovina calvaria from Romania. This individual is of highest importance for the understanding of modern human origins in Europe, and has recently been proposed to represent a Neanderthal-modern human hybrid. We present a short description and a three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometric analysis of the Cioclovina specimen using a large geographic sample of recent humans, Neanderthals and Middle and Late Pleistocene fossil hominins from Europe, Africa, and the Levant, in order to establish its phenetic affinities and to evaluate its morphology for evidence of admixture between Neanderthals and early modern Europeans.

Despite general agreement about allocation of Sterkfontein and Makapansgat fossils to this species, limited morphological comparisons have been possible between these adult specimens and the juvenile Taung. Here, we used developmental simulation to estimate the adult form of the Taung child, and directly compare its morphology to that of other fossil hominins. Specimens were represented by 50 three-dimensional landmarks superimposed by generalized Procrustes analysis. The simulation process applied developmental trajectories from extant hominine species to the Taung fossil in order to generate its adult form. Despite differences found in the developmental patterns of these modern species, simulations tested on extant juveniles-transforming them into ""adults"" using trajectories from other species-revealed that these differences have negligible impact on adult morphology. This indicates that morphology already present by occlusion of the first permanent molar is the primary determinant of adult form, thereby supporting use of extant trajectories to estimate the morphology of an extinct species. The simulated Taung adult was then compared to other adult fossils. As these comparisons required assumptions about the pattern and magnitude of developmental change, additional analyses were performed to evaluate these two parameters separately. Results of all analyses overwhelmingly rejected the possibility that the Taung child was a juvenile robust australopith, but were consistent with the hypothesis that the Taung and Sterkfontein fossils are conspecific. Between Sts 5 and Sts 71, the latter is more likely to resemble the adult form of the Taung child. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Several authors have noted broad resemblances between European and African fossils from this period, suggesting a single taxon ancestral to both modern humans and Neanderthals. Others point out 'incipient' Neanderthal features in the morphology of the European sample and have argued for their inclusion in the Neanderthal lineage exclusively, following a model of accretionary evolution of Neanderthals. We approach these questions using geometric morphometric methods which allow the intuitive visualization and quantification of features previously described qualitatively. We apply these techniques to evaluate proposed cranio-facial 'incipient' facial, vault, and basicranial traits in a middle-late Pleistocene European hominin sample when compared to a sample of the same time depth from Africa. Some of the features examined followed the predictions of the accretion model and relate the middle Pleistocene European material to the later Neanderthals. However, although our analysis showed a clear separation between Neanderthals and early/recent modern humans and morphological proximity between European specimens from OIS 7 to 3, it also shows that the European hominins from the first half of the middle Pleistocene still shared most of their cranio-facial architecture with their African contemporaries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Face; Geometric morphometrics; Homo heidelbergensis; Neanderthal; Occipital; Temporal","archaeology; cranium; fossil record; human evolution; morphometry; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; three-dimensional modeling; visualization; Homo heidelbergensis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958177900

Although significant changes in craniofacial and postcranial morphology have been found between the Middle Paleolithic and earlier Upper Paleolithic modern humans of western Eurasia and the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene inhabitants of the same region, most studies of dental maturation and structural morphology have compared Neandertals only to later Holocene humans. To assess whether earlier modern humans contrasted with later modern populations and possibly approached the Neandertal pattern, we used high-resolution microtomography to analyze the remarkably complete mixed dentition of the early Upper Paleolithic (Gravettian) child from Abrigo do Lagar Velho, Portugal, and compared it to a Neandertal sample, the late Upper Paleolithic (Magdalenian) child of La Madeleine, and a worldwide extant human sample.Some aspects of the dental maturational pattern and tooth endostructural organization of Lagar Velho 1 are absent from extant populations and the Magdalenian specimen and are currently documented only among Neandertals. Therefore, a simple Neandertal versus modern human dichotomy is inadequate to accommodate the morphostructural and developmental variation represented by Middle Paleolithic and earlier Upper Paleolithic populations. These data reinforce the complex nature of Neandertal-modern human similarities and differences, and document ongoing human evolution after the global establishment of modern human morphology.","Dentition; Development; Modern humans; Neandertal; Pleistocene","article; child; comparative study; extant species; human; human tissue; maturation; modern times; morphology; Paleolithic; Portugal; priority journal; tooth development; Anthropology, Physical; Bayes Theorem; Child; Evolution; Female; Humans; Male; Portugal; Tooth",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-76549103471

Here we report results from the microtomographic-based (SR-μCT) high-resolution structural investigation of the maxilla and mandible of the Neanderthal child from Roc de Marsal, Dordogne, France (likely from OIS 5a). Following their virtual extraction and 3D rendering, we assessed the maturational stage of each of the 41 dental elements (20 deciduous and 21 permanent) forming its mixed dentition. By using a Bayesian approach, we calculated the probability that its deciduous and permanent mandibular sequences are found within the extant human variation as illustrated by a tomographic CT-based sub-sample of 32 children (deciduous dentition) and a panoramic radiographic- and CT-based whole sample of 343 living children (permanent dentition). Results show that neither the deciduous nor the permanent mandibular sequences displayed by Roc de Marsal are precisely found within our modern comparative files. In both sequences, the most influential factor is represented by a slight discrepancy in the Neanderthal child between the stage of mineralization of the first molar, which is proportionally advanced, and the maturational level reached by its incisors, which are proportionally delayed. Following a quantitative volumetric analysis of the deciduous teeth, we suggest that this characteristic may be related to differences between Neanderthals and modern humans in absolute dental size and relative size proportions between front and cheek teeth, as well as to structural differences in dental tissue proportions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies of morphological integration typically are situated in-between these two styles of explanation. They are based on the consilience of observed phenotypic covariances with qualitative developmental, functional, or evolutionary models. Here we review different forms of integration along with multiple other sources of phenotypic covariances, such as geometric and spatial dependencies among measurements. We discuss one multivariate method [partial least squares analysis (PLS)] to model phenotypic covariances and demonstrate how it can be applied to study developmental integration using two empirical examples. In the first example we use PLS to study integration between the cranial base and the face in human postnatal development. Because the data are longitudinal, we can model both cross-sectional integration and integration of growth itself, i. e., how cross-sectional variance and covariance is actually generated in the course of ontogeny. We find one factor of developmental integration (connecting facial size and the length of the anterior cranial base) that is highly canalized during postnatal development, leading to decreasing cross-sectional variance and covariance. A second factor (overall cranial length to height ratio) is less canalized and leads to increasing (co)variance. In a second example, we examine the evolutionary significance of these patterns by comparing cranial integration in humans to that in chimpanzees. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Canalization; Cranial growth; Developmental integration; Modularity; Morphometrics; Partial least squares analysis","Pan",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870849567

Specifically, it addresses whether males and females of each species share a common postnatal ontogenetic shape trajectory for the facial skeleton. Where trajectories are found to differ, it is tested whether male and female trajectories: 1) diverge early, or 2) diverge later after sharing a common trajectory earlier in the postnatal period. Where ontogenetic shape trajectories are found to be shared, it is also tested whether males and females are ontogenetically scaled. This study uses geometric morphometric analyses of 28 landmarks from the facial skeletons of 137 G. g. gorilla (62 adults; 75 juveniles), 95 P. paniscus (34 adults; 61 juveniles), and 115 P. t. troglodytes (58 adults; 57 juveniles). On average, males and females share a common ontogenetic shape trajectory until around the eruption of the second permanent molars. In addition, for the same period, males and females in each species share a common ontogenetic scaling trajectory. After this period, males and females diverge both from each other and from the common juvenile ontogenetic shape and scaling trajectories within each species. Thus, the male and female facial skeleton shows ontogenetic scaling until around the point of the eruption of the second molar (i.e., around puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics), but subsequent sexual dimorphism occurs via divergent trajectories and not via ontogenetic scaling. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The details of the supraorbital morphology, as well as the quantitative assessment of the shape of the external surface of the squama using traditional and 3D geometric morphometrics, unambiguously assign the Zeeland Ridges frontal bone to Homo neanderthalensis. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis indicate that the Zeeland Ridges hominin, like other Neandertals, was highly carnivorous and does not show evidence for the consumption of aquatic foods. A lesion on the outer table and diploic layer of the bone in the area of the supratoral sulcus can be interpreted as the result of an intradiploic epidermoid cyst, a type of neoplasm diagnosed for the first time in Neandertal remains. So far, the Zeeland Ridges Neandertal is the first Pleistocene fossil hominin found under seawater and the first recorded in the Netherlands. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the number of individuals available for investigation is limited and most of these fossils are, to some degree, incomplete and/or distorted. Uncertainties of the required reconstruction ('missing data uncertainty') and the small sample size ('small sample uncertainty') both potentially bias estimates of the average and within-group variation of endocranial volume in A. africanus.We used CT scans, electronic preparation (segmentation), mirror-imaging and semilandmark-based geometric morphometrics to generate and reconstruct complete endocasts for Sts 5, Sts 60, Sts 71, StW 505, MLD 37/38, and Taung, and measured their endocranial volumes (EV). To get a sense of the reliability of these new EV estimates, we then used simulations based on samples of chimpanzees and humans to: (a) test the accuracy of our approach, (b) assess missing data uncertainty, and (c) appraise small sample uncertainty.Incorporating missing data uncertainty of the five adult individuals, A. africanus was found to have an average adult endocranial volume of 454-461 ml with a standard deviation of 66-75 ml. EV estimates for the juvenile Taung individual range from 402 to 407 ml. Our simulations show that missing data uncertainty is small given the missing portions of the investigated fossils, but that small sample sizes are problematic for estimating species average EV. It is important to take these uncertainties into account when different fossil groups are being compared. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Computed tomography; Segmentation; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline","brain; computer simulation; fossil; hominid; human evolution; morphometry; primate; segmentation; tomography; uncertainty analysis; Australopithecus africanus; Pan",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859159890

Though principal component plots of multivariate shape data seem to resemble classical bivariate allometric plots, the language of heterochrony cannot be translated directly into general multivariate methodology. We simulate idealized multivariate ontogenetic trajectories and demonstrate their behavior in principal component plots in shape space and in size-shape space. The concept of ""dissociation"", which is conventionally regarded as a change in the relationship between shape change and size change, appears to be algebraically the same as regional dissociation - the variation of apparent heterochrony by region. Only if the trajectories of two related species lie along exactly the same path in shape space can the classic terminology of heterochrony apply so that pure dissociation of size change against shape change can be detected. We demonstrate a geometric morphometric approach to these issues using adult and subadult crania of 48 Pan paniscus and 47 P. troglodytes. On each specimen we digitized 47 landmarks and 144 semilandmarks on ridge curves and the external neurocranial surface.

It allows us to exhibit highly sophisticated cognitive and behavioral abilities. Therefore, our brain's size and morphology are defining features of our species and our fossil ancestors and relatives. Endocasts, i. e., internal casts of the bony braincase, provide evidence about brain size and morphology in fossils. Based on endocasts, we know that our ancestors' brains increased overall in size and underwent several reorganizational changes. However, it is difficult to relate evolutionary changes of size and shape of endocasts to evolutionary changes of cognition and behavior. We argue here that an understanding of the tempo and mode of brain development can help to interpret the evolution of our brain and the associated cognitive and behavioral changes. To do so, we review structural brain development, cognitive development, and ontogenetic changes of endocranial size and shape in living individuals on the one hand, and ontogenetic patterns (size increase and shape change) in fossil hominins and their evolutionary change on the other hand. Tightly integrating our knowledge on these different levels will be the key of future work on the evolution of human brain development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cognitive development; Endocast; Hominin; Ontogeny","Primates",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859155458

We use concepts of kinematic analysis of locomotion to propose a methodological framework for the kinematic analysis of cranial form change during ontogeny. We argue that a combination of geometric-morphometric methods with graphics visualization tools currently represents the most adequate means to analyze the kinematics of ontogeny. Using cranial growth models, we simulate how evolutionary modifications of developmental processes impinge on morphological patterns of ontogeny, and explore how differences in ontogenetic patterns can tentatively be traced back to underlying process differences. Our analyses indicate that minor alterations in growth parameters elicit complex patterns of ontogenetic modification that are difficult to describe with the standard repertoire of heterochronic terminology. The proposed kinematic and model-based approach is used in a comparative analysis of cranial ontogeny in Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans, indicating that early ontogenetic modification of a small set of growth parameters is a major source of evolutionary novelty during hominid evolution. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"animal; article; biological model; biomechanics; biometry; comparative study; computer simulation; evolution; growth, development and aging; histology; hominid; human; morphogenesis; morphometrics; skull; species difference; time; Animals; Biomechanics; Biometry; Body Weights and Measures; Computer Simulation; Evolution; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Biological; Morphogenesis; Skull; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Hominidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042762753

In the past two decades, there has been an increasing emphasis in exploring the correlations of these patterns with taxonomy and the variation in patterns within and among the craniofacial regions. Scrutinising these relationships for hominids, we decompose the craniofacial morphology in five taxa: Homo sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. 3D coordinates of 35 traditional landmarks and 61 semilandmarks, covering five ridge curves, are measured for each of 268 adult and sub-adult specimens and analysed using geometric morphometric methods. A multivariate analysis in size-shape space shows that ontogenetic scaling contributes to the development of sexual dimorphism in all five taxa, but to a varying extent. In absolute as well as in relative terms P. pygmaeus shows the greatest allometric component, followed by G. gorilla. Homo is intermediate, while in Pan the non-allometric constituent part contributes a large fraction to the actual sexual dimorphism, most markedly in the pygmy chimpanzee. An eigendecomposition of the five vectors of sexual dimorphism reveals two dimensions independent of allometry. One separates orang-utan sexual dimorphism from the African apes and Homo, and the other differentiates between the great apes and Homo with Pan mediating. We discuss these patterns and speculate on their use as characters for taxonomic analysis in the fossil record.","Craniofacial sexual dimorphism pattern; Geometric morphometrics; Growth allometry; Hominids","adult; allometry; animal tissue; Anthropoidea; ape; article; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; fossil; gorilla; hominid; human; human tissue; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; ontogeny; orang utan; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; primate; sex difference; species difference; taxonomy; three dimensional imaging; Alocasia macrorrhizos; Animalia; Anthropoidea; Gorilla gorilla; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Paniscus; Pongo pygmaeus; Primates; Troglodytes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-11244283330

Radiometric dates and the archaeological context (Acheulo-Yabrudian) bracket the associated cave layers to between 200 and 500ka (thousands of years ago), making it one of the earliest cranial fossils discovered in the Near East thus far. Its geographic position, at the corridor between Africa and Eurasia, in combination with its probable Middle Pleistocene date make it a crucial specimen for interpreting later human evolution. Since its discovery, qualitative descriptive and traditional morphometric methods have variously suggested affinities to Homo erectus (Zhoukoudian), Homo neanderthalensis (Tabun), and early Homo sapiens (Skhul and Qafzeh). To better determine the taxonomic affinities of the Zuttiyeh fossil, this study uses 3D semilandmark geometric morphometric techniques and multivariate statistical analyses to quantify the frontal and zygomatic region and compare it with other Middle to Late Pleistocene African and Eurasian hominins.Our results show that the frontal and zygomatic morphology of Zuttiyeh is most similar to Shanidar 5, a Near East Neanderthal, Arago 21, a European Middle Pleistocene hominin, and Skhul 5, an early H.sapiens. The shape differences between archaic hominins (i.e., Homo heidelbergensis and H.neanderthalensis) in this anatomical region are very subtle.We conclude that Zuttiyeh exhibits a generalized frontal and zygomatic morphology, possibly indicative of the population that gave rise to modern humans and Neanderthals.

In particular, the degree to which the three adult crania exhibit recent East Asian morphology, as well as their degree of within-group variability, has long been debated. Several early researchers described a resemblance to East Asian populations, but these findings have been for the most part rejected by more recent metric and non-metric analyses. Nevertheless, the Upper Cave specimens have not been classified conclusively into any recent modern human population to which they have been compared, and classification results differ for each cranium. Here, the question of the affinities of Upper Cave 101 and 103, the two better-preserved crania, is examined from the perspective of the Late Pleistocene human fossil record using the methodology of 3-D geometric morphometrics. The degree of morphological variation between the two specimens is also evaluated within the context of recent population variability. Neurocranial and facial morphology are analyzed separately so as to maximize comparative samples. Results show a morphological resemblance of the Upper Cave material to Upper Paleolithic Europeans. It is proposed that the Upper Cave specimens retain important aspects of modern human ancestral morphology, and possibly share a recent common ancestral population with Upper Paleolithic Europeans, in accordance with the Single Origin model of modern human origins. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the importance of brain size increase, the developmental bases of human brain size evolution remain poorly characterized. Comparative analyses of endocranial volume size growth illustrate that distinctions between humans and other primates are consequences of differences in rates of brain size growth, with little evidence for differences in growth duration. Evaluation of available juvenile fossils shows that earliest hominins do not differ perceptibly from chimpanzees (Pan). However, rapid and human-like early brain growth apparently characterized Homo erectus at about 1 Ma before present. Neandertals show patterns of brain growth consistent with modern humans during infancy, but reach larger sizes than modern humans as a result of differences in later growth. Growth analyses reveal commonalities in patterns of early brain size growth during the last million years human evolution, despite major increases in adult size. This result implies consistency across hominins in terms of maternal metabolic costs of infancy. Continued size growth past infancy in Neandertals and modern humans, when compared to earlier hominins, may have cognitive implications. Differences between Neandertals and modern humans are implied, but difficult to define with certainty. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Australopithecus; Homo erectus; Neandertals; Ontogeny; Paleoanthropology","Australopithecus; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Pan; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867576690

The Hofmeyr skull was largely intact at the time of its discovery but has suffered post-recovery mishandling, with the resultant loss of most of the lower facial skeleton, the mandibular angle, the right mastoid process, and much of the occipital. Given the potential significance of this specimen, we have undertaken its restoration and reconstruction so as to provide a more complete picture of the cranial morphology of the late Pleistocene population from which it derived. On the basis of photographs, measurements, and morphological description recorded prior to its having been damaged, we reconstructed some of the missing bone in modeling clay on a high resolution plastic cast of the cranium. The original specimen was CT scanned, as was the cast with the reconstructed maxilla and mastoid; these scans were employed in the final computer reconstruction of the skull. Virtual reconstruction of the remainder of the cranium was accomplished using mirror-imaging and reference-based methods, employing 3D geometric morphometrics from a sample of recent human crania to compute coordinate-based estimates of the missing parts.

Phylogenetic relationships among these groupings are also explored using neighbor-joining analysis of the metric data. Results indicate that the terminal Pleistocene/early Holocene fossils from Australasia exhibit a close genetic affinity with early modern humans from the Levant. Furthermore, recent human populations and Upper Paleolithic Europeans share a most recent common ancestor not shared with either the early Australasians or the early Levantine humans. This pattern of genetic and phylogenetic relationships suggests that the early modern humans from the Levant either contributed directly to the ancestry of an early lineage of Australasians, or that they share a recent common ancestor with them. The principal findings of the study, therefore, lend support to the notion of an early dispersal from Africa by a more ancient lineage of modern human prior to 50 ka, perhaps as early as OIS 5 times (76-100 ka). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, high quality ontogenetic data are scarce, especially for nonhuman primates. Here, we provide original data derived from an osteological collection of a wild population of Pan troglodytes verus from the Taï Forest National Park, Ivory Coast. This sample is unique, because age, sex, and pedigree information are available for many specimens from behavioral observations in the wild. We scanned crania of all 30 immature specimens and 13 adult individuals using high-resolution computed tomography. We then created virtual casts of the bony braincase (endocasts) to measure EVs. We also measured cranial length, width, and height and attempted to relate cranial distances to EV via regression analysis. Our data are consistent with previous studies. The only neonate in the sample has an EV of 127 cm 3 or 34% of the adult mean. EV increases rapidly during early ontogeny. The average adult EV in this sample is 378.7 ± 30.1 cm 3. We found sexual dimorphism in adults; males seem to be already larger than females before adult EV is attained. Regressions on cranial width and multiple regression provide better estimates for EV than regressions on cranial length or height. Increasing the sample size and compiling more high quality ontogenetic data of EV will help to reconcile ongoing discussions about the evolution of hominin brain growth.

Fifty-five fossil crania dating from the early to the late Pleistocene were analyzed. Using a modified pantograph, outlines of the frontal bone were collected along the midsagittal and two parasagittal planes. The profile from nasion to bregma, as well as two profiles above the medial and lateral sections of the orbit, respectively, extending from the orbital margin to the coronal suture were traced. The outlines were measured using Elliptical Fourier Function Analysis (EFFA), which enabled a quantification of aspects of the frontal bone that have historically been described primarily in nonmetric or linear terms. Four measurements were obtained: 1) overall morphology as expressed in the Fourier harmonic amplitudes; 2) maximum projection of the supraorbital torus at three points along the browridge (glabella and the medial and lateral aspects of the torus above the orbit); 3) maximum distance of the frontal squama from the frontal chord, capturing forehead curvature; and 4) nasion-bregma chord length. The results indicate that the midsagittal profile is significantly different among all Pleistocene groups in analyses that include both size and shape, as well as size-adjusted data. Homo erectus is significantly different from the late Pleistocene groups (Neandertals and early modern H. sapiens) in glabellar projection. Anatomically modern humans are significantly different from all other groups in both raw and size-standardized analyses of all three outlines that captured overall morphology, as well as forehead curvature and lateral supraorbital torus prominence, and middle Pleistocene Homo are significantly different in both medial and lateral overall parasagittal form.

Research on mental foramen position has focused on whether this feature is inferior to a particular tooth. However, tooth position may not be a reliable indicator of mental foramen position because of variability in tooth size within and between taxa and during eruption events. As opposed to observing the mental foramen with respect to the postcanine teeth, we examined linear distances from the mental foramen to other mandibular landmarks. Modern human adults may appear truncated, or paedomorphic, in mental foramen position with respect to Neandertal adults. However, infants of the two taxa differ substantially in anterior mandibular form. The initial differences in the shape of the mental region may be related to the embryological position of the mental foramen in modern humans and its role in the development of the mental trigone. The shape changes that accrue thereafter, possibly from faster mandibular growth rates in Neandertals, further distinguish the adults from one another. Although mandibular shape differences exist from early infancy onwards, adults of the two taxa are broadly similar in bi-mental foramen breadth with respect to mandibular size. For this reason, qualitative assessments of mental foramen position may provide less taxonomic information than previously thought. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It depends directly on the understanding of ontogenetic trajectories and their basic constituents: timing, rate and associated patterns of maturation. In the present study, we applied geometric morphometrics to investigate postnatal ontogeny in human and chimpanzee skulls (N = 302). We evaluated postnatal ontogenetic rates, based on comparisons of properties of size and shape in adults. At different dental ages the percentage of the adult mean size (growth) and adult mean shape (development) was used to quantify patterns of maturation. We found significantly higher levels of ontogenetic maturity in humans than chimpanzees during pre-M1 and M1 eruption. However, during this ontogenetic period the human increments were lower than those of chimpanzees suggesting lower rates. During and after M2-eruption species did not differ in their ontogenetic trajectories. The results indicate that higher prenatal and lower peri- and postnatal maturation rates characterize human ontogeny when compared with chimpanzees. If mandibular ontogeny is considered alone, a paradox was found. Whereas growth maturation proceeded in an expected trajectory continuously approximating 100% adult mean size, developmental maturity was different. After M1-eruption in both species the morphological distance, which had increased before, became reduced again, and reached adult mean shape in a second developmental peak. Such a tendency was found in humans and chimpanzees. This indicates that both size and shape maturation must be considered to understand the complexity of postnatal mandibular ontogeny.","Craniofacial maturation; Evolutionary development; Geometric morphometrics; Heterochrony; Procrustes distance","adult; animal tissue; article; chimpanzee; controlled study; embryo; human; human tissue; mandible; maturation; morphology; morphometrics; nonhuman; ontogeny; perinatal period; postnatal growth; prenatal period; skull development; Animalia; Pan (ape); Pan troglodytes; Procrustes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-11244319438

However, to date, no reference data are available for modern human EV ontogeny. We measured 94 skulls with known sex and age (ranging from 0 to 7.5 years) from the osteological collection of Strasbourg University (OCSU) by using an accurate digital active contour model algorithm on 3D virtual models, reconstructed by CT. The OCSU data also allow us to propose improved equations for estimating EV in immature individuals from dry skull diameters (length, width, and height). Aside from the EV, the average proportional endocranial volume (PEV), corresponding to the ratio of EV at a given age to the average EV in the corresponding adult population, was also computed. EV nearly doubles during the first year of life, and later continues to expand more slowly, at least until 7 years of age. No sex differences can be demonstrated between the EV distributions of boys and girls in this sample. However, although PEV at birth is identical in girls and boys, it later displays significantly higher values in the girls of our series. PEV obtained at birth is 22%, which is quite different from values established for the brain itself from autopsied individuals, or MRI data. This suggests that assessments of EV and PEV values in fossil specimens should be conducted by using identical measures in comparative samples of extant humans and apes.

A close examination of the original Russian monograph reveals the incompleteness of key morphologies associated with the cranial base and face and problems with the reconstruction of the Teshik-Tash cranium, making its Neandertal attribution less certain than previously assumed. This study reassesses the Neandertal status of Teshik-Tash 1 by comparing it to a sample of Neandertal, Middle and Upper Paleolithic modern humans, and recent human sub-adults. Separate examinations of the cranium and mandible are conducted using multinomial logistic regression and discriminant function analysis to assess group membership. Results of the cranial analysis group Teshik-Tash with Upper Paleolithic modern humans when variables are not size-standardized, while results of the mandibular analysis place the specimen with recent modern humans for both raw and size-standardized data.

In addition to general rate of growth, a prolonged postnatal period of brain development allows humans to develop complex cognitive and social skills. Conditions in brain growth similar to those observed in extant humans were not established in the first representatives of Homo erectus. To assess the degree of secondary altriciality reached by Neandertals, we examined the most complete skulk available for immature Neandertal specimens. The endocranial volumes were evaluated by using equations based on external cranial measurements. The proportional endocranial volumes (PEV) of these fossils were compared to the PEV of known age modern children from Western Europe and to a developmental series of Pan troglodytes.

Principal component scores of the Fourier harmonic amplitudes were derived and served as a quantitative representation of the morphology of the frontal bone. Morphological, geographical, and temporal distance matrices were then constructed between each pair of fossils. A partial Mantel matrix correlation test was performed between morphological and geographical distance matrices, controlling for temporal distance, in order to determine if the pattern of geographical differentiation in features of the frontal bone of mid-Pleistocene Homo followed that of an isolation-by-distance model of population structure. The results of the partial Mantel tests indicate that the overall patterning of differentiation in the features of the frontal bone cannot best be explained by a population structure shaped by isolation-by-distance.

The pattern of migration across inner Asia and the subsequent duration/intensity of hominin colonization of these areas, however, are still poorly resolved. The large territory of Central Asia defines a clear path within Eurasia through which hominin dispersals farther east may have occurred. The purpose of the present study is to examine the degree to which an autochthonous evolutionary trajectory is supported in Central Asia and how the potential connections between this and neighboring regions may be characterized during the Pleistocene. Archaeological and human paleontological evidence from the region is reviewed and compared to that from the Near East, the Altai, and China. This review informs a more detailed analysis of the Central Asian Middle Paleolithic record. Prevailing theoretical models suggest that Central Asia was inhabited by Neandertals migrating from the west to seek refuge from expanding modern human populations during the Middle Paleolithic. Morphological analyses of the newly discovered Obi-Rakhmat hominin and a re-evaluation of the Teshik-Tash child, both from sites in Uzbekistan, provide a test of this model. Results indicate that evidence of the morphological pattern that typically describes European Neandertals is equivocal in Central Asia. Although both Obi-Rakhmat and Teshik-Tash express some Neandertal features, their morphologies also suggest some admixture with local populations and/or those migrating into Central Asia from the North and East. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Anghilak Cave; Central Asia; Colonization; Early Pleistocene; Hominin migration; Initial Upper Paleolithic; Middle Paleolithic variability; Obi-Rakhmat Grotto; Uzbekistan",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045694796

Although phenetically similar to mangabeys, molecular analyses suggest it is more closely related to Papio or possibly descended from an ancient population of baboon-mangabey hybrids. At present, only a single kipunji specimen, an M1-stage juvenile male, is available for study; thus, the cranial morphology of the adult kipunji is unknown. In this study, we used developmental simulation to estimate the adult kipunji's 3D cranial morphology. We examined variation in cercopithecine developmental vectors, applied selected vectors to the juvenile cranium, and compared the resulting simulated adults to actual adult male papionins. Differences between papionin developmental vectors were small and statistically insignificant. This uniformity suggests conservation of an ancestral papionin developmental program. Simulated kipunji adults were likewise extremely similar. As a group, the simulated adults were morphometrically distinct from other papionins, corroborating the kipunji's generic status. Simulated adults were phenetically most similar to Lophocebus aterrimus but were distinguished from all adult papionins by the same unique traits that characterize the kipunji juvenile: a tall neurocranium, broad face, short nasal bones, concave anteorbital profile, and dorsally rotated palate. This concordance between juvenile and estimated-adult morphologies confirms that papionin cranial shape is largely established before M1 eruption. The estimated kipunji adult's neurocranium strongly resembles that of Papio, providing the first cranial evidence supporting their phylogenetic relationship.

Here we present the results of a geometric morphometric study of the SGF of the Neanderthal Vi-209 from Vindjia Cave (Croatia), relative to samples of Plio-Pleistocene, later Pleistocene, and recent hominins. Variation in overall SGF shape follows a chronological trend from the plesiomorphic condition seen in Australopithecus to modern humans, with pre-modern species of the genus Homo exhibiting intermediate morphologies. Change in body size across this temporal series is not linearly directional, which argues against static allometry as an explanation. However, life history and developmental rates change directionally across the series, suggesting an ontogenetic effect on the observed changes in shape (ontogenetic allometry). Within this framework, the morphospace occupied by the Neanderthals exhibits a discontinuous distribution. The Vindija SGF and those of the later Near Eastern Neanderthals (Kebara and Shanidar) approach the modern condition and are somewhat segregated from both northwestern European (Neandertal and La Ferrassie) and early Mediterranean Neanderthals (Krapina and Tabun). Although more than one scenario may account for the pattern seen in the Neanderthals, the data is consistent with palaeogenetic evidence suggesting low levels of gene flow between Neanderthals and modern humans in the Near East after ca. 120-100ka (thousands of years ago) (with subsequent introgression of modern human alleles into eastern and central Europe). Thus, in keeping with previous analyses that document some modern human features in the Vindija Neanderthals, the Vindija G3 sample should not be seen as representative of 'classic' - that is, unadmixed, pre-contact - Neanderthal morphology. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Europe; Geometric morphometrics; Human evolution; Late Pleistocene; Neanderthal/modern human interactions; Shoulder","allele; allometry; body size; comparative study; gene flow; human evolution; life history; morphology; morphometry; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; taxonomy; Croatia; Vindija Cave; Australopithecus; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856529717

It is unclear, however, whether all robusts belong to a monophyletic Paranthropus clade, as the craniofacial resemblance among robust australopiths might only be a superficial correlate of similar masticatory adaptations and not evidence of shared ancestry. It has been suggested that the East African Australopithecus/Paranthropus boisei and the South African A./P. robustus might be convergent allometric variants of their gracile geographical neighbors A. afarensis and A. africanus. Here we approach the phylogenetic questions about robust and gracile australopiths from an ""evo-devo"" perspective, examining how simple alterations of development could contribute to the shape differences among hominin species. Using geometric morphometrics we compare gracile and robust australopith crania in the context of the allometric scaling patterns of Pan troglodytes, P. paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla. We examine support for two alternative evolutionary scenarios based on predictions derived from quantitative genetics models: either (1) A./P. robustus evolved in South Africa from the gracile A. africanus, or (2) A./P. robustus is a local variant of the eastern African A./P. boisei. We use developmental simulations to demonstrate that some robust characteristics (wide faces, anteriorly placed zygomatics, and facial dishing) can be predicted by allometric scaling along the ontogenetic trajectory of the gracile A. africanus. We find, however, that the facial differences between A. africanus specimens (Taung, Sts 5, Sts 71, and Stw 505) and A./P. robustus specimen SK 48 cannot be explained by allometric scaling alone. Facial shape differences between A./P. robustus SK 48 and A./P. boisei (KNM-ER 732, KNM-ER 406, OH 5) and the A./P. aethiopicus specimen KNM-WT 17000, on the other hand, can largely be explained by allometric scaling. This is consistent with a close evolutionary relationship of these robust taxa. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Allometry; Australopithecus; Development; Geometric morphometrics; Growth trajectory; Hominin; Paranthropus; Scaling; Semilandmarks; Sterkfontein; Swartkrans","Australopithecus; Australopithecus afarensis; Australopithecus africanus; Crania; Gorilla gorilla; Pan troglodytes; Paranthropus; Paranthropus boisei; Paranthropus robustus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870778754

However, by about 20,000 BP this area was settled by modern humans who had highly sophisticated and sometimes unique technologies. Not many Upper Paleolithic human fossils have been described from this area and consequently the morphology of these people remains largely unknown. Here, we present descriptions and a comparative morphological analysis of four possibly late Pleistocene fossils from European Russia: Skhodnya, Khvalynsk, Satanay, and Podkumok. The frontal bone is chosen for study because it is preserved in all of these fossils and is known to provide good discrimination among groups of Pleistocene hominins. All four fossils have been previously claimed to possess 'archaic' features of frontal morphology, such as developed supraorbital relief and a flat frontal squama. The results of a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of frontal bone landmarks and semilandmarks indicate that these fossils indisputably belong to modern humans. However, there are good reasons to associate Khvalynsk, Skhodnya, and Podkumok with Upper Paleolithic fossils from central and western Europe, whereas Satanay is more similar to a pooled sample of recent modern humans. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Frontal bone; Geometric morphometrics; Russian calvariae","bone; dispersal; fossil; hominid; morphology; morphometry; Paleolithic; Russian Federation",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650863246

The fossil material consists of more than 100 specimens from the large Main Cave (e.g., Mladeč 1 and 2) and from the Quarry Cave (e.g., Mladeč 5 and 6). Both sites seem to be accumulations of human remains that fell through chimneys or fissures into the karstic cave system (Frayer, 1986; Svoboda, 2000). The morphological differences of Mladeč 5 and 6 vs. 1 and 2 (interestingly each group originating from a different cave) are attributed to sexual dimorphism by most authors (Jelínek, 1983; Frayer, 1986; Wolpoff et al., this volume). In spite of substantial morphological variation within sex (Frayer, 1986), the specimens considered to be male (Mladeč 5 and 6) are very robust, with a low braincase, thick cranial bones, Neandertal-like occipital bunning, marked spongy bone development, thick projecting supraorbitals shaped differently than in Neandertals, and large cranial capacities, whereas the female specimens (Mladeč 1 and 2) are more gracile than the Mladeč males but robust nevertheless in comparison with recent Homo sapiens. Since 1900 (Anthropology-Congress Halle a. S., IX/1900), the Mladeč remains have been generally considered to be modern Homo sapiens (""Cro-Magnon race""; Szombathy, 1925) or, according to the discoverer, as ""definitely belonging to the Homo sapiens fossilis"" (ibid.). Most anthropologists today accept Mladeč as modern Homo sapiens, but the prominent supraorbitals, the welldeveloped occipital bun reminiscent of the Neandertal ""chignon"", and the distinct nuchal ridge have stimulated speculations about possible anatomical links to the Neandertals who preceded them. The relation of this assemblage (one of the earliest in Central Europe) to other groups of fossil hominids is crucial and likewise the question of hybridisation (Bräuer, 1980; Duarte et al., 1999; Tattersall and Schwartz, 1999) because of the chronological and regional overlapping of anatomically modern humans and Neandertals in Europe. That relation has therefore been the focus of diverse studies, including comparisons of gross morphology (Jelínek, 1951; Smith, 1982; Frayer, 1986; Bräuer and Broeg, 1998, Wolpoff et al., 2001; Frayer et al., this volume; Wolpoff et al., this volume) and of mtDNA (Serre et al., 2004) and new radiometric datings of hominid and faunal remains (Wild et al., 2005). Especially Mladeč 5 (see Fig. 1.) was described as Neandertal-like in several aspects by Smith (1982), Jelínek (1983), and Wolpoff (1999), and also as resembling Jebel Irhoud-like or archaic Homo (Stringer et al., 1984). Frayer (1986) saw Mladeč as ""good evidence in support of the gradualist model,"" with ""a greater number of archaic features shared with Neandertals"" (see also Frayer et al., this volume). Others have reached quite opposite conclusions: for instance, Bräuer and Broeg (1998) via a non-metric analysis. Klein (2003), too, noted that the typical cranial traits of Neandertals preclude a major Neandertal contribution to living human populations. © 2006 Springer-Verlag/Wien.
