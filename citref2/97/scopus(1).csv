Collectively these may be regarded as m configurations, or scalings, each of n points in p-dimensions. The problem is investigated of translating, rotating, reflecting and scaling the m configurations to minimize the goodness-of-fit criterion Σi=1m Σi=1n Δ2(Pj(i)Gi), where Gi is the centroid of the m points Pi(i) (i = 1, 2, ..., m). The rotated positions of each configuration may be regarded as individual analyses with the centroid configuration representing a consensus, and this relationship with individual scaling analysis is discussed. A computational technique is given, the results of which can be summarized in analysis of variance form. The special case m = 2 corresponds to Classical Procrustes analysis but the choice of criterion that fits each configuration to the common centroid configuration avoids difficulties that arise when one set is fitted to the other, regarded as fixed. © 1975 Psychometric Society.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001886818

The same questions have to be answered in case of fetal bones. Fetal bones present a particularly difficult problem. Fazekas and Kosa have dedicated themselves to the further scientific development of investigations in the particular field of forensic fetal osteology. They measured meticulously all relevant parameters of more than 150 fetal skeletons and analysed the results statistically. The data obtained revealed a remarkable linearity; consequently fetal age can be assessed within half a lunar month. Even with a single bone accurate estimation of the gestational age of a fetus proved to be possible with the aid of the acquired and tabulated data. The importance of this book on fetal osteology widely exceeds its forensic scope. It may prove to be a useful reference work not only for the benefit of forensic pathologists but also to embryologists, anatomists and obstetricians.",,"autopsy; bone; book; cartilage; correlation; embryo; fetus; forensic medicine; legal aspect; osteology; regression",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004119406

In such cases methods for estimating age should fulfil the following specific demands: (1) they must have been presented to the scientific community, as a rule by publication in peer-reviewed journals, (2) clear information concerning accuracy of age estimation by the method should be available, (3) the methods need to be sufficiently accurate and (4) in cases of age estimation in living individuals principles of medical ethics and legal regulations have to be considered. We have identified and summarized the methods that essentially fulfil these specific demands. In childhood and adolescence morphological methods based on the radiological examination of dental and skeletal development are to be recommended. In adulthood, the accuracy of most morphological methods is much reduced. Here a biochemical method based on aspartic acid racemization in dentine provides the most accurate estimates of age, followed by special morphological dental and skeletal methods. The choice of method has to take account of the individual circumstances of each case. Most methods require either the consultation of specialised and trained scientists or an adequate calibration by the 'user'. Very few attempts have been made to find common standardisation, calibration and evaluation procedures or to develop means of quality assurance for methods of age estimation. Efforts in these directions are necessary to guarantee quality standards and adequate answers to the important legal and social issue of age estimation in forensic medicine.","Age estimation; Demands; Forensic practise; State of the art","age determination; bone development; forensic identification; human; legal aspect; methodology; morphology; priority journal; review; social aspect; standardization; Adolescent; Adult; Age Determination by Skeleton; Age Determination by Teeth; Bias (Epidemiology); Child; Continental Population Groups; Ethics, Medical; Female; Forensic Dentistry; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Male; Needs Assessment; Practice Guidelines; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Characteristics",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034122006

There are various methods for evaluating tooth mineralization based on classification by stages. The aim of the present work is to assess the validity of the common classification systems. To this end, we analyzed 420 conventional orthopantomograms of German females aged 12-25 years old. The mineralization status of tooth 38 was determined using the stages defined by Gleiser and Hunt, Demirjian et al., Gustafson and Koch, Harris and Nortje and Kullman et al., respectively. Of the methods tested, the most accurate results were obtained with Demirjian et al.'s classification system, which performed best not only for observer agreement but also for the correlation between estimated and true age. It is argued that this is due to the fact that Demirjian et al.'s classification is based on a sufficient number of stages which are defined independently of speculative estimations of length. This leads to the conclusion that the method devised by Demirjian et al. should be used for evaluating the mineralization of third molars for purposes of forensic age determination. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Dental age; Forensic age estimation; Mineralization; Third molars","accuracy; adolescent; adult; age determination; article; classification; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; forensic medicine; Germany; human; human tissue; mineralization; molar tooth; panoramic radiography; priority journal; school child; validation process; Adolescent; Adult; Age Determination by Teeth; Child; Female; Forensic Dentistry; Humans; Molar, Third; Tooth Calcification",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-12444327255

Teeth provide several useful points about an individuals age. With advancing age secondary dentine is deposited along the wall of the dental pulp chamber leading to a reduction in the size of the pulp cavity. These age-related changes can be determined and measured from dental radiographs. The aim of this study was to explore if measurements of the size of the pulp cavity performed on orthopantomograms can be used for individual age estimation. Measurements were made digitally for 6 types of teeth from orthopantomograms of 168 individuals aged between 14 and 81 years old. To compensate for errors due to the technique of radiography -for instance differences in angulation - ratios of distances were calculated: pulp/root length, pulp/tooth length and pulp/root width at three different root levels. The width ratios of the pulp cavity showed significant correlation to the chronological age and the coefficient of determination (r2) was highest in the upper lateral incisors (r2=0.913) when an exponential or a logistic regression model was constructed. At the same distance with a linear regression model the coefficient of determination (r2) reached 0.839. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Age determination; Orthopantomography; Secondary dentine; Teeth","adolescent; adult; age determination; aged; analytical error; article; calculation; controlled study; correlation analysis; dentin; female; human; incisor; linear regression analysis; logistic regression analysis; male; panoramic radiography; priority journal; quantitative analysis; statistical significance; tooth crown; tooth root; Adolescent; Adult; Age Determination by Teeth; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Dentin, Secondary; Female; Forensic Dentistry; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Incisor; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Radiography, Panoramic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-12444257755

We used four distinct cross-sectional samples of 1,528 healthy children: 3 of known geographic origin (Ivory Coast, Iran and France) and 1 additional sample of children whose grandparents originated from a different continent. Two different methods of calculations are compared: the correspondence analysis combined with linear regression (CAR) and Bayesian predictions (with no independence assumption). Our results indicate that the quality of age assessment does not seem to depend predominantly on the use of geographic-specific standards. In the case of Bayesian predictions, we observed a clear trend in favour of significantly higher accuracy and reliability levels when using non-geographic-specific standards. One of the main advantage of Bayesian predictions over maximum likelihood methods of estimation is an overall increase in accuracy with high levels of reliability on a fraction of the test sample and, importantly, across all age categories (contrary to methods based on regression analysis). Importantly, in the case of Bayesian non-adult predictions, and contrary to age estimation techniques based on regression, a better quality does not depend on age. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Accuracy; Age; Bayesian; Estimation; Geographic-specific; Reliability","accuracy; adolescent; age determination; article; Bayes theorem; calculation; child; comparative study; controlled study; correspondence analysis; Cote d'Ivoire; female; France; geography; human; human tissue; Iran; linear regression analysis; male; parent; prediction; priority journal; quality control; reliability; statistical significance; tooth; Adolescent; Age Determination by Teeth; Bayes Theorem; Child; Cote d'Ivoire; Ethnic Groups; Female; France; Humans; Iran; Male; Minerals; Regression Analysis; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-24344508665

Published studies providing regression equations for such use almost invariably include the standard error of estimate. Unfortunately, it is exceptional for forensic anthropologists to use the standard error to calculate correctly the confidence limits for their single predicted value. We attempt to show why this may be and provide explicit guidelines for the proper construction of confidence intervals in such circumstances.",,"age; anthropology; autopsy; bone; female; forensic identification; human; male; methodology; normal human; preliminary communication; priority journal; regression analysis; sex difference; skeleton; Anthropology, Physical; Forensic Medicine; Regression Analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023790257

To this effect, 402 hand radiograms, originally taken in two large German cities between 1983 and 2002 for the purpose of diagnosing trauma, were analyzed. At the time of examination, the patients were aged between 10 and 18 years. The study presents the mean, standard deviation, and median, with lower and upper quartiles, for the skeletal ages of 11.0 through 18.0 years. The simple standard deviations range between 0.2 and 1.2 years. To increase the accuracy of age estimates and improve the identification of age-relevant developmental disorders in forensic age estimation practice, the methods for determining skeletal age should always be combined with a physical and dental examination. In addition, the expert opinion should pay attention to the issue of different modernization levels in relevant populations. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Forensic age estimation; Hand ossification; Skeletal age","adolescent; adult; age determination; age distribution; article; bone age; bone examination; child; city; controlled study; data analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic approach route; diagnostic procedure; female; forensic identification; Germany; hand radiography; human; human tissue; injury; male; ossification; physical examination; priority journal; reference database; statistical parameters; Thiemann Nitz method; tooth; Adolescent; Age Determination by Skeleton; Child; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Germany; Hand; Humans; Male; Reference Values; Sex Characteristics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-29244481678
