This fundamental behavioral shift is purported to signal a cognitive advance, a possible reorganization of the brain, and the origin of language. Because the earliest modern human fossils, Homo sapiens sensu stricto, are found in Africa and the adjacent region of the Levant at > 100 ka, the ""human revolution"" model creates a time lag between the appearance of anatomical modernity and perceived behavioral modernity, and creates the impression that the earliest modern Africans were behaviorally primitive. This view of events stems from a profound Eurocentric bias and a failure to appreciate the depth and breadth of the African archaeological record. In fact, many of the components of the ""human revolution"" claimed to appear at 40-50 ka are found in the African Middle Stone Age tens of thousands of years earlier. These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the ""human revolution"" model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviors in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World. The African Middle and early Late Pleistocene hominid fossil record is fairly continuous and in it can be recognized a number of probably distinct species that provide plausible ancestors for H. sapiens. The appearance of Middle Stone Age technology and the first signs of modern behavior coincide with the appearance of fossils that have been attributed to H. helmei, suggesting the behavior of H. helmei is distinct from that of earlier hominid species and quite similar to that of modern people. If on anatomical and behavioral ground H. helmei is sunk into H. sapiens, the origin of our species is linked with the appearance of Middle Stone Age technology at 250-300 ka.","African archaeology; Middle Pleistocene; Middle Stone Age; Modern behavior; Origin of Homo sapiens","behavior; human activity; Animalia; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034493580

The terrigenous record exhibits a well-defined period of low influx between 14.8 and 5.5 cal. ka BP associated with the African Humid Period, when the Sahara was nearly completely vegetated and supported numerous perennial lakes; an arid interval corresponding to the Younger Dryas Chronozone punctuates this humid period. The African Humid Period has been attributed to a strengthening of the African monsoon due to gradual orbital increases in summer season insolation. However, the onset and termination of this humid period were very abrupt, occurring within decades to centuries. Both transitions occurred when summer season insolation crossed a nearly identical threshold value; which was 4.2% greater than present. These abrupt climate responses to gradual insolation forcing require strongly non-linear feedback processes, and current coupled climate model studies invoke vegetation and ocean temperature feedbacks as candidate mechanisms for the non-linear climate sensitivity. The African monsoon climate system is thus a low-latitude corollary to the bi-stable behavior of high-latitude deep ocean thermohaline circulation, which is similarly capable of rapid and large-amplitude climate transitions.",,"climate change; climate forcing; monsoon; paleoclimate; Africa",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033957744

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

Close correlations appear when comparing Holocene palaeoenvironmental data (lake levels, fluvial activity, Mediterranean surface temperature and salinity, marine sedimentation) with the main stages of the history of the circum-Mediterranean vegetation. They indicate an evolution of the Mediterranean biome controlled by the climate and emphasize the teleconnections between the climate of the Mediterranean area and the global climatic system. In the circum-Mediterranean area, the Holocene can be divided into three periods: a lower humid Holocene (11 500-7000 cal BP) interrupted by dry episodes; a transition phase (7000-5500 cal BP) during which occurred a decrease in insolation as well as the installation of the present atmosphere circulation in the northern hemisphere; and an upper Holocene (5500 cal BP-present) characterized by an aridification process. Throughout the Holocene, humans used and modified more or less strongly the environment but the climatic changes were the determining factors of the evolution of the Mediterranean biome. Societies had to adapt to natural environmental variations, their impact on the environment increasing the ecological consequences of the global changes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"anthropogenic effect; aridification; biome; climate change; climate forcing; environmental factor; global climate; Holocene; human activity; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; paleosalinity; sedimentation rate; teleconnection; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-64749093734

Analyses of incremental features in teeth provide an accurate means of assessing the age at death of developing dentitions, facilitating direct comparisons with fossil and modern humans. It is currently unknown when and where the prolonged modern human developmental condition originated. Here, an application of x-ray synchrotron microtomography reveals that an early Homo sapiens juvenile from Morocco dated at 160,000 years before present displays an equivalent degree of tooth development to modern European children at the same age. Crown formation times in the juvenile's macrodont dentition are higher than modern human mean values, whereas root development is accelerated relative to modern humans but is less than living apes and some fossil hominins. The juvenile from Jebel Irhoud is currently the oldest-known member of Homo with a developmental pattern (degree of eruption, developmental stage, and crown formation time) that is more similar to modern H. sapiens than to earlier members of Homo. This study also underscores the continuing importance of North Africa for understanding the origins of human anatomical and behavioral modernity.

Global genetic analyses have argued for one single origin, placed somewhere in Africa. This scenario implies a rapid expansion, with a series of bottlenecks of small amplitude, which would have led to the observed smooth loss of genetic diversity with increasing distance from Africa. Analyses of cranial data, on the other hand, have given mixed results, and have been argued to support multiple origins of modern humans. Using a large data set of skull measurements and an analytical framework equivalent to that used for genetic data, we show that the loss in genetic diversity has been mirrored by a loss in phenotypic variability. We find evidence for an African origin, placed somewhere in the central/southern part of the continent, which harbours the highest intra-population diversity in phenotypic measurements. We failed to find evidence for a second origin, and we confirm these results on a large genetic data set. Distance from Africa accounts for an average 19-25% of heritable variation in craniometric measurements-a remarkably strong effect for phenotypic measurements known to be under selection. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"analytical framework; cranium; dispersal; genetic analysis; heritability; phenotype; population bottleneck; Africa; article; biogenesis; bottleneck population; controlled study; craniometry; female; genetic database; genetic variability; human; male; phenotypic variation; population research; priority journal; Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447521876

A crucial outcome of such behaviors has been the dramatic reshaping of the global biosphere, a transformation whose early origins are increasingly apparent from cumulative archaeological and paleoecological datasets. Such data suggest that, by the Late Pleistocene, humans had begun to engage in activities that have led to alterations in the distributions of a vast array of species across most, if not all, taxonomic groups. Changes to biodiversity have included extinctions, extirpations, and shifts in species composition, diversity, and community structure. We outline key examples of these changes, highlighting findings from the study of new datasets, like ancient DNA (aDNA), stable isotopes, and microfossils, as well as the application of new statistical and computational methods to datasets that have accumulated significantly in recent decades. We focus on four major phases that witnessed broad anthropogenic alterations to biodiversity-the Late Pleistocene global human expansion, the Neolithic spread of agriculture, the era of island colonization, and the emergence of early urbanized societies and commercial networks. Archaeological evidence documents millennia of anthropogenic transformations that have created novel ecosystems around the world.

Given that the first modern humans north of the Sahara are found in the Levant ≈120-90 ka, northward dispersal likely occurred during a humid episode in the Sahara within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e (130-117 ka). The obvious dispersal route, the Nile, may be ruled out by notable differences between archaeological finds in the Nile Valley and the Levant at the critical time. Further west, space-born radar images reveal networks of - now buried - fossil river channels that extend across the desert to the Mediterranean coast, which represent alternative dispersal corridors. These corridors would explain scattered findings at desert oases of Middle Stone Age Aterian lithic industries with bifacial and tanged points that can be linked with industries further to the east and as far north as the Mediterranean coast.

Two major determinants of circum-African climate variability over this time period are supported by principal components analysis: North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) variations and local insolation maxima. North Atlantic SSTs correlated with the variability found in most circum-African SST records, whereas the variability of the majority of terrestrial temperature and precipitation records is explained by local insolation maxima, particularly at times when solar radiation was intense and highly variable (e.g., 150-75 ka). We demonstrate that climates varied with latitude, such that periods of relatively increased aridity or humidity were asynchronous across the northern, eastern, tropical and southern portions of Africa. Comparisons of the archaeological, fossil, or genetic records with generalized patterns of environmental change based solely on northern hemisphere glacial/interglacial cycles are therefore imprecise.We compare our refined climatic framework to a database of 64 radiometrically-dated paleoanthropological sites to test hypotheses of demographic response to climatic change among African hominin populations during the 150-30 ka interval. We argue that at a continental scale, population and climate changes were asynchronous and likely occurred under different regimes of climate forcing, creating alternating opportunities for migration into adjacent regions. Our results suggest little relation between large scale demographic and climate change in southern Africa during this time span, but strongly support the hypothesis of hominin occupation of the Sahara during discrete humid intervals ~135-115 ka and 105-75 ka. Hominin populations in equatorial and eastern Africa may have been buffered from the extremes of climate change by locally steep altitudinal and rainfall gradients and the complex and variable effects of increased aridity on human habitat suitability in the tropics. Our data are consistent with hominin migrations out of Africa through varying exit points from ~140-80 ka. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Demography; Homo sapiens; Paleoclimate; Pleistocene; Population dispersal","archaeology; aridity; climate variation; data set; demography; fossil record; hominid; Northern Hemisphere; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; sea surface temperature; solar radiation; Southern Hemisphere; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Sahara; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860333985

Comparing their oxygen isotope stratigraphy with recognized pollen stratigraphy a great coherence is evident, which indicates that vegetational history is a useful proxy to evaluate paleoclimatic change and emphasises the potential of marine palynology. A fluctuating Mediterranean vegetation zone is evidenced: a widespread distribution is registered from 240-190 ka BP, 125-70 ka BP, and after 10 ka BP. During intervening (glacial) periods a much reduced distribution is noted. However, some interstadials (dated 180-160 ka BP and 55-40 ka BP) permitted some expansion of Mediterranean oak forest. The northwestern Saharan boundary shifted over about 4° of latitude, the massive relief of the Atlas Mountains being its nothernmost limit. A gradual northward expansion of the desert during the last two glacials is registered, indicating a gradual aridification of the northwestern Sahara towards Termination II and I. The Artemisia rich, partly Pinus wooded steppe-like vegetation formed a narrow zone between the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean vegetation during interglacials. During glacials, however, the steppe-like vegetation strongly expanded and formed a transition zone from the Sahara to the treeless Westeuropean tundra's. Regional and temporal diversity in the glacial composition of this Artemisia dominated steppe-like vegetation zone is expressed by fluctuations in the records of grasses and Mediterranean shrub elements. The Mediterranean-Saharan transition zone was narrowest shortly after Termination II and I, indicating a steep gradient in humidity across the Atlas Mountains. The much discussed climatic change in the northwestern Sahara and Maghreb during the last 40 ka BP is addressed: cold and moderately dry climate frrm 40 ka to 30 ka BP, increasing aridity from 30 ka to 20 ka BP, arid conditions from 20 ka to 15 ka BP, gradually less arid conditions from 15 ka to 8.5 ka BP, and warm and humid conditions after 8.5 ka BP are evidenced. © 1992.",,"Artemisia; climate change; desert; marine pollen record; oxygen isotope stratigraphy; palaeoclimate change; vegetation; Atlantic, (North)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027064198

Here it is proposed that the southern coastal plain (SCP) of South Africa may have served as a geographical point of origin through periodic expansion and contraction (isolation) in response to glacial/interglacial changes in sea level and climate. During Pleistocene interglacial highstands when sea level was above -75 m human populations were isolated for periods of 360-3400 25-yr generations on the SCP by the rugged mountains of the Cape Fold Belt, climate and vegetation barriers. The SCP expands five-fold as sea level falls from -75 to -120 m during glacial maxima to form a continuous, unobstructed coastal plain accessible to the interior. An expanded and wet glacial SCP may have served as a refuge to humans and large migratory herds and resulted in the mixing of previously isolated groups. The expansive glacial SCP habitat abruptly contracts, by as much as one-third in 300 yr, during the rapid rise in sea level associated with glacial terminations. Rapid flooding may have increased population density and competition on the SCP to select for humans who expanded their diet to include marine resources or hunted large animals. Successful adaptations developed on an isolated SCP are predicted to widely disperse during glacial terminations when the SCP rapidly contracts or during the initial opening of the SCP in the transition to glacial maxima. The hypothesis that periodic expansion and contraction of the SCP, as well as the coastal plain of North Africa, contributed to the stepwise origin of our species over the last 800 thousand years (kyr) is evaluated by comparing the archeological, DNA and sea-level records. These records generally support the hypothesis, but more complete and well dated records are required to resolve the extent to which sea-level fluctuations influenced the complex history of human evolution. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Allopatry; Human evolution; Maghreb; Pleistocene; Sea level; Shelf; South Africa","Allopatry; Human evolution; Maghreb; Pleistocene; Shelf; South Africa; Animals; Marine biology; Population statistics; Sea level; Glacial geology; allopatry; coastal plain; continental shelf; flooding; glacial-interglacial cycle; human evolution; marine record; Pleistocene; population density; refuge; sea level change; Maghreb; South Africa; Animalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952043406

We assessed the plausibility of several previously published biogeographic hypotheses, using the frog genera Alytes, Discoglossus, and Bombina as model groups. Our data set comprised ca. 900 bp of partial mitochondrial 16S and 12S rRNA gene sequences (both genes evolved in a clock-like manner across genera) from nearly all the species and subspecies in the three genera. We tested several calibrations of a molecular clock, which resulted in competing temporal settings for the evolution of taxa. Although only one scenario was in complete accordance with paleogeographic data, statistical testing did not reject the alternatives.

The hyperarid area alternately expanded and shrank on both sides of a seemingly narrow semi-permanent eremitic zone along the Tropic of Cancer during the course of the Quaternary epoch (1.7Ma). The Cenozoic, Mesozoic and Paleozoic Sahara, in turn, has undergone drastic climatic changes as the African continent drifted northward from its Antarctic position to reach its present latitudinal situation. But, seemingly the Sahara was never the large desert it now is, with the exception perhaps of the Upper Triassic Lower Liassic epochs. The Pleistocene and Holocene contrasting climate changes induced large variations in flora and fauna distribution, as well as in geomorphic processes. The flora shifted from that of typical desert to tropical savanna and Mediterranean forest or steppe, depending on period and location. Fauna, in turn, changed more in abundance than in nature, since the same groups have been in existence since the Upper Pliocene-Lower Pleistocene. Large mammals, for instance, were mainly of Afro-tropical kinship throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene, while small mammals, in contrast, were predominantly of Mediterranean origin over the same periods. And such is still the case. There were varying large degrees in density of occurrence, but relatively minor fluctuations in nature, in response to such environmental changes as lake and dune expansion and retreat, and even glacier expansion and melting at higher elevations. The present-day man-made expansion of desertic conditions to the north and south actually threaten both flora and fauna alike in the short- and medium-term. Most African large mammals, still present in the desert until the second half of the 19th century, have now become extinct, or are on the very verge of extinction in the Sahara (some may be surviving further south, and/or in the East Africa's parks network). The situation, however, is far less dramatic for the flora, which still includes almost 3000 species of vascular plants, although some species - of economic value or not - are in danger from the man-made destruction of their habitat.","Biodiversity; Biogeography; Climate change; Desert; Desertification; Fauna; Flora; Natural resources; Sahara","biotic change; climate change; climatic change; desertification; environmental change; environmental history; palaeoenvironment; Phanerozoiate; Phanerozoic; Africa; Sahara",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031436333

The subfamily Gerbillinae is no exception as previous studies based on morphological, karyotypical, and allozyme characters are highly incongruent. Here, we present the first molecular phylogeny for gerbils based on cytochrome b and 12S rRNA mitochondrial genes. Results are largely congruent between the two genes as well as with the concatenated data set with most of the nodes being well-supported. Based on the topologies retrieved here, we (1) propose the identification of three main clades, (2) support the split of Tatera genus into an Asian and an African group, the latter including Gerbillurus species, and (3) provide some evidence towards the inaccuracy of subgeneric divisions within both Gerbillus and Meriones. In addition, the sharp contrast between the genetic characters and morphological data sets suggest high levels of convergence, probably as a result of strong environmental constraints imposed on these rodents adapted to arid and semi-arid regions. Finally, molecular datings for the various cladogenetic events are in good agreement with the known gerbilline fossil record and support an African origin with subsequent migrations to Asia. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we set out to address this shortfall. Location: North-West Africa and the Mediterranean. Methods: We reviewed the existing literature on the biogeography of North Africa, and carried out analyses of species distribution data using parsimony, nestedness and co-occurrence methods. Results: In many cases, distribution patterns of non-flying mammals, bats, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, zygaenid moths and odonates demonstrated important biogeographical affinities between Europe and North Africa at the species level. On the other hand, species co-occurrence, nestedness and parsimony analysis also revealed some deep splits between the Maghreb and Europe; yet even in these cases the closest affinities were found between the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb. Furthermore, North Africa harbours the highest proportion of endemic taxa (13.7%) across all groups analysed. Many molecular studies demonstrated a strong genetic cohesiveness between North Africa and Europe despite the potential barrier effect of the Mediterranean Sea. In other taxa, however, remarkable splits were detected. In addition, southern European genetic lineages were often nested within North African clades, and many taxa showed exceptionally high genetic variability and differentiation in this region.

Clade A occurs in Portugal, Spain and Morocco north of the Atlas Mountains. Clade B occurs south of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and north of the Atlas Mountains in eastern Algeria and Tunisia. However, we recorded a single individual containing a clade B haplotype in Morocco from north of the Atlas Mountains. This could indicate gene flow between both clades. The phylogenetically most distinct clade A haplotypes are confined to Morocco, suggesting both clades originated in North Africa. Extensive diversity within clade A in south-western Iberia argues for a glacial refuge located there. Other regions of the Iberian Peninsula, displaying distinctly lower haplotype diversities, were recolonized from within south-western Iberia. Most populations in Portugal, Spain and northern Morocco contain the most common clade A haplotype, indicating dispersal from the south-western Iberian refuge, gene flow across the Strait of Gibraltar, and reinvasion of Morocco by terrapins originating in south-western Iberia. This hypothesis is consistent with demographic analyses, suggesting rapid clade A population increase while clade B is represented by stationary, fragmented populations. We recommend the eight, morphologically weakly diagnosable, subspecies of M. leprosa be reduced to two, reflecting major mtDNA clades: Mauremys l. leprosa (Iberian Peninsula and northern Morocco) and M. l. saharica (southern Morocco, eastern Algeria and Tunisia). Peripheral populations could play an important role in evolution of M. leprosa because we found endemic haplotypes in populations along the northern and southern range borders. Previous investigations in another western Palearctic freshwater turtle (Emys orbicularis) discovered similar differentiation of peripheral populations, and phylogeographies of Emys orbicularis and Mauremys rivulata underline the barrier status of mountain chains, in contrast to sea straits, suggesting common patterns for western Palearctic freshwater turtles. © The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters 2005.",,"Emydidae; Emys orbicularis; Mauremys; Mauremys leprosa; Mauremys rivulata; Reptilia; Testudines",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33644893901

We were able to calculate OSL ages for 32 of the 33 samples collected from the Middle Palaeolithic deposits, including the earliest and latest Aterian levels at both sites. These ages reveal periods of occupation between about 110 and 95 ka (thousands of years ago), and at ∼75 ka. A late Middle Palaeolithic occupation of El Harhoura 2 is also recorded at ∼55 ka. Our single-grain OSL chronologies largely support previous age estimates from El Mnasra and other sites along the Atlantic coast of Morocco, but are generally more precise, reproducible and stratigraphically more coherent (i.e., fewer age reversals). We compare the single-grain ages for El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra with those obtained from single- and multi-grain OSL dating of Middle Palaeolithic deposits in the nearby sites of Contrebandiers and Dar es-Soltan 1 and 2, and with records of past regional environments preserved in sediment cores collected from off the coast of northwest Africa. A conspicuous feature of the new chronologies is the close correspondence between the three identified episodes of human occupation and periods of wetter climate and expanded grassland habitat. Owing to the precision of the single-grain OSL ages, we are able to discern gaps in occupation during Marine Isotope Stages 5 and 4, which may represent drier periods with reduced vegetation cover. We propose that these climatic conditions can be correlated with events in the North Atlantic Ocean that exert a major control on abrupt, millennial-scale fluctuations between wet and dry periods in northwest and central North Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Aterian; Dose distributions; MIS 5; Palaeoenvironments; Sand-sized quartz; Sediment mixing","chronology; geological record; luminescence dating; marine isotope stage; nature-society relations; occupation; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; sediment core; stratigraphic correlation; stratigraphy; vegetation cover; Morocco",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858080771

One lentil has been dated to 7611 ± 37 cal BP representing the oldest direct date of a domesticated plant seed in Morocco and, by extension, in North Africa. Similarities in both radiocarbon dates and crop assemblages from Early Neolithic sites in Northern Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula suggest a simultaneous East to West maritime spread of agriculture along the shores of the Western Mediterranean. Wild plants were abundantly collected in both the Epipalaeolithic and the Early Neolithic periods pointing to the important role of these resources during the two periods. In addition to fruits and seeds that could have been consumed by both humans and domesticated animals, fragments of esparto grass (Stipa tenacissima) rhizomes have been identified.

Thus, understanding the palaeoclimate of the Saharo-Arabian region is central to determining the role these deserts played in the peopling of the planet; when did they act as barriers and when were they more humid, opening dispersal routes across them? To address these questions we have conducted a temporal and spatial evaluation of dated sites from 20 to 350ka using combined probability density function (PDF) and geographical Information System (GIS) analyses of all sites dated using uranium/thorium (U/TH) or optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) methods. Radiocarbon dates were not considered because of contamination problems in this time range. The results show that during MIS 2 there is little evidence for humidity in Arabia as would be expected during the height of the last glacial maximum, however, the Sahara shows a sharp rise in probability at the beginning of MIS 2, peaking near the boundary with MIS 3 at ~29ka. There appear to be brief periods of humidity in MIS 3 and 6, though at different times in the Sahara (ca. 37, 44, 138, 154 and 180ka) and Arabia (ca. 40, 54 and 163ka). During MIS 5, both regions show much evidence for humidity, with PDF peaks corresponding to insolation maxima, though not all maxima are represented in either the Saharan or Arabian record. This situation can be explained by eccentricity-modulated precession: when eccentricity is strong, insolation is enhanced (but also more variable) and the desert climate is generally more humid, particularly at times of high insolation. The opposite happens when eccentricity is low, and deserts tend to be more arid, but local factors exert more of an influence on climate, affecting the timing and strength of the brief humid periods experienced, so that they no longer coincide with insolation maxima. The spatial distribution of humid sites is compatible with a number of different modern human dispersal theories. Southern Arabia experienced humid periods centred on 54ka and 125ka, and this could have facilitated dispersal from east Africa to southern Arabia and beyond via the Bab el Mandab. The Sahara shows considerable evidence for humidity during MIS 5 and may have had dispersal across its expanse at this time. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"GIS; hominid; humidity; Last Glacial Maximum; luminescence dating; marine isotope stage; paleoclimate; Paleolithic; probability density function; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; temporal analysis; uranium series dating; Eastern Desert; Egypt; Sahara",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878984853

In Morocco, very few studies are specifically dedicated to small fossil vertebrates, and neither taphonomic nor palaeoecological studies have been undertaken on these taxa, particularly in archaeological contexts. The late Pleistocene to middle Holocene succession of El Harhoura 2 cave, situated in the region of Témara, yields an exceptionally rich small vertebrate assemblage. We present the results of a first systematic, taphonomic, and palaeoecological study of the small mammals from Levels 1 to 8 of El Harhoura 2. The absence of bone sorting and polishing, as well as the presence of significant traces of digestion indicate that the small mammal bones were accumulated in the cave by predators and that no water transport occurred. Other traces observed on the surface of bones consist mainly of root marks and black traces (micro-organisms or more probably manganese) which affected the majority of the material. The percentage of fragmentation is very high in all stratigraphic levels, and the post-depositional breakage (geologic and anthropogenic phenomena) obscure the original breakage patterns of bones by predators. According to the ecology of the different species present in the levels of El Harhoura 2, and by taking into account possible biases highlighted by the taphonomic analysis, we reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental evolution in the region. For quantitative reconstructions we used two indices: the Taxonomic Habitat Index (THI) and the Gerbillinae/Murinae ratio. Late Pleistocene accumulations were characterised by a succession of humid (Levels 3, 4a, 6, and 8) and arid (Levels 2?, 5, and 7) periods, with more or less open landscapes, ending in an ultimate humid and wooded period during the middle Holocene (Level 1). We discuss particular limits of our results and interpretations, due to an important lack of taxonomic, ecological, and taphonomic knowledge in North Africa. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","El Harhoura 2; Late Quaternary; North-Atlantic Morocco; Palaeoecology; Small mammals; Taphonomy","archaeological evidence; cave deposit; climate variation; depocenter; fossil assemblage; fossil record; Holocene; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; paleontology; Pleistocene; small mammal; taphonomy; taxonomy; Morocco; Rabat; Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer; Temara; Homo sapiens; Mammalia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649451520

The influence of predation is widely studied for large mammal sites where humans, acting as predators, produce bone accumulations similar to carnivore accumulations. Similarly, small mammal fossil sites are mainly occupation levels of predators (nests or dens). In both cases, investigations of past events can be compared with present day equivalents or proxies. Chewing marks are sometimes present on large mammal predator accumulations, but digestion traits are the most direct indication of predation, and evidence for this is always present in small mammal (prey) fossil assemblages. Digestion grades and frequency indicates predator type and this is well established since the publication of Andrews (1990). The identification of the predator provides invaluable information for accurate interpretation of the palaeoenvironment. Traditionally, palaeoenvironmental interpretations are obtained from the taxonomic species identified in the site, but rather than providing direct interpretations of the surrounding palaeoenvironment, this procedure actually describes the dietary preferences of the predators and the type of occupation (nests, marking territory, dens, etc). This paper reviews the identification of traits produced by predators on arvicolins, murins and soricids using a method that may be used equally by taxonomists and taphonomists. It aims to provide the ""tools"" for taxonomists to identify the predator based on their methodology, which is examining the occlusal surfaces of teeth rather than their lateral aspects. This will greatly benefit both the work of taphonomists and taxonomists to recognize signs of predation and the improvement of subsequent palaeoecological interpretations of past organisms and sites by identifying both the prey and the predator. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Digestion; Predation; Small mammals; Taphonomy; Taxonomy","Bone; Sludge digestion; Taxonomies; Large mammals; Occlusal surfaces; Palaeoenvironment; Predation; Small mammals; Taphonomy; Mammals; bone; digestion; fossil record; identification method; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; predation; small mammal; study method; taphonomy; taxonomy; tooth; Mammalia; Soricidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962599316

In captivity, they are commonly affected by dental disease. As the range of dental disease occurring in wild chinchillas is unknown, the dentition of museum specimens originally obtained from the wild was assessed and compared with specimens prepared from captive-bred animals. Skulls from wild-caught chinchillas showed minimal evidence of dental disease and the teeth were all short, cheek-tooth lengths averaging 5.9 mm. Cheek-tooth lengths in zoo specimens (average 6.6 mm), clinically normal (average 7.4 mm) and captive-bred animals with dental disease (average 10 mm) were significantly elongated by comparison (P < 0.0001). Captive-bred specimens showed a wide range of tooth-related lesions. These results suggest that some aspect of captivity is responsible for the development of dental disease in chinchillas. It is suggested that the diet (its physical form and composition) is the main aetiological factor, and that provision of a diet closely matching that of wild chinchillas should significantly reduce the incidence of dental disease in captive animals. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Chinchilla; Dental disease; Malocclusion; Teeth; Tooth elongation","animal; animal disease; animal experiment; animal food; animal tissue; article; cheek; chinchilla; comparative study; controlled study; dentition; diet; domestic animal; female; male; malocclusion; nonhuman; pathology; skull; tooth; tooth disease; tooth size; Animal Feed; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Animals, Wild; Chinchilla; Female; Male; Skull; Tooth; Tooth Attrition; Tooth Diseases; Animalia; Chinchillidae; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034840050

Homo sapiens. The Mediterranean coast of North Africa, the Sahara, the Nile Valley, the Red Sea coast, and the Bab el Mandab could have been corridors leading out of Africa. Even though data are still too scanty, heterogeneous, and patchy to support one hypothesis against the others, scholars have tended to search for "" the"" route out of Africa, as if one passageway would rule out possible others. However, a single-dispersal model may not be correct as early modern humans may have found different ways to leave their native lands. If North Africa can contribute to an understanding of the adaptational dynamics of modern human peopling and their radiation towards different parts of Eurasia, other regions, such as the Horn of Africa, may be contemplated as well.This paper focuses on the events that took place in North Africa. In this region, anatomically modern humans were not always successful once they departed from Africa and moved towards the temperate, and dry, latitudes of the eastern Mediterranean basin in the Levant. Two distinct movements have been recognised within the Out-of-Africa 2 model, one occurring between c. 130 and 80 ka, the other taking place after 50 ka. The two phenomena were separated by an abrupt climatic transition that affected the south-western Mediterranean basin during the transition from MIS 5a to MIS 4, around 74 ka. As these two events exhibit very distinct features and are divided by a long time span, it seems reasonable to refer to the first event as "" Out of Africa 2a"" and to the second one as "" Out of Africa 2b"" . During the first migration out of Africa, modern humans seem to have failed in the competition for resources against Neanderthals, whereas they succeeded in their second migration. This paper examines some of the reasons of the failure of the Out-of-Africa-2a migration and, on the other hand, of the success of the Out-of-Africa-2b movement with particular attention to North Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"anatomy; hominid; migration; Neanderthal; numerical model; North Africa; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864315722

We tested this model using the dental phenotype of modern and ancient common voles (Microtus arvalis), introduced onto the Orkney archipelago (Scotland) from continental Europe some 5000 years ago. First, we investigated phenotypic divergence of Orkney and continental European populations and assessed climatic influences. Second, phenotypic differentiation among Orkney populations was tested against geography, time, and neutral genetic patterns. Finally, we examined evolutionary change along a time series for the Orkney Mainland. Molar gigantism and anterior-lobe hypertrophy evolved rapidly in Orkney voles following introduction, without any transitional forms detected. Founder events and adaptation appear to explain this initial rapid evolution. Idiosyncrasy in dental features among different island populations of Orkney voles is also likely the result of local founder events following Neolithic translocation around the archipelago. However, against our initial expectations, a second marked phenotypic shift occurred between the 4th and 12th centuries AD, associated with increased pastoral farming and introduction of competitors (mice and rats) and terrestrial predators (foxes and cats). These results indicate that human agency can generate a more complex pattern of morphological evolution than might be expected in island rodents. © 2014 The Authors.","Dispersal; Evolutionary rate; Geometric morphometrics; Island evolution; Tooth shape; Zooarchaeology","adaptation; divergence; ecological modeling; geometry; morphology; morphometry; Neolithic; population structure; rodent; Europe; Mainland [Shetland]; Scotland; Shetland; United Kingdom; Microtus arvalis orcadensis; Muridae; adaptation; anatomy and histology; animal; Arvicolinae; biological model; climate; ecosystem; Europe; founder effect; genetic variability; genetics; island (geological); molar tooth; molecular evolution; phenotype; population genetics; United Kingdom; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Arvicolinae; Climate; Ecosystem; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Founder Effect; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Islands; Models, Genetic; Molar; Phenotype; Scotland",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908068182

It has been through a series of taxonomic revisions, but the phylogenetic relationships among the species remain unclear. In this study we estimate the phylogeographic structure of M. guttulata across most of its distributional range and we evaluate the relationships between M. guttulata and the sympatric species M. brevirostris and M. bahaeldini using partial mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences (cyt b and 16S). M. guttulata and M. brevirostris represent species complexes, whereas M. bahaeldini considered before as M. guttulata is a recently described species with very restricted distribution. Here we present the first evidence that M. guttulata is a paraphyletic taxon with respect to M. bahaeldini, while M. brevirostris proves to be a polytypic species or even a species complex, confirming previous studies. Although mtDNA markers have several properties that make them suitable for phylogeographic studies, they are not free of difficulties. Phylogeographic inferences within and between closely related species can be mislead by introgression and retention of ancestral polymorphism (incomplete lineage sorting). However, the present distribution pattern, the estimated times of divergence and the significant variation in morphology within M. guttulata led us to accept that the paraphyletic pattern observed, is most likely due to inaccurate taxonomy. Our hypothesis is that what has hitherto been considered as intraspecific variation, actually reflects species-level variation. Furthermore, our biogeographic analyses and the estimated time of divergences suggest that the present distribution of M. guttulata was the result of several dispersal and vicariant events, which are associated with historical changes (climatic oscillations and paleogeographic barriers) of late Miocene and Pliocene period. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

During the Upper Pleistocene, from ca. 40 000 ans BP. to ca. 28 000 years BP., a fresh climate favoured the expansion of Quercus canariensis deciduous oak forest. In the Glacial and the Late Glacial periods, ca. 20 000-18 000 till 10 000 BP., a resinuous forest (Abies, Cedrus and Pinus) superseded the oak forest wich was confined to the lowlands. At this time, Northern Tunisia could offer refuges for woody taxa coming from Algeria where highlands were only covered by grassy vegetation because of the cooling. At the beginning of the Holocene, the climate became gradually warmer and wetter and favoured the return and the large extension of the deciduous forest while a decline of resinous forest occurred during Boreal and Atlantic periods ( 9 000 BP.-5 000 BP.). This large distribution of deciduous oak forest persists during the Subboreal period (5 000 BP.-2 500 BP.). However, around 4000 years BP., an aridity peak is recorded by a large extension of grasslands and a temporarily decline of forests. After that, at the Subatlantic period, climate evolved to present situation, warmer and wetter, propicious to forest development but this one suffered from anthropic damages. The first effects of human activities happened at the Bronze Age, accentuating the one's of the drought occuring ca. 4 000 years BP. During the Carthaginian and the Roman periods, betwen ca . 2 500 to ca. 1800 years BP., an important clearing of wood was made for needing timbers. In the course of 7th-8th centuries AD, pastoralism practices of Arabs populations induced progression of Quercus suber and matorrals. During the last centuries happened a renewal of a mixed oak forest with predomination of Quercus suber. But, at present, an important degradation of the Cork oak forest results from demographic pressure and expansion of pastoralism.","Paleoenvironment; Palynology; Tunisia; Upper quaternary","Abies; Cedrus; Quercus canariensis; Quercus suber",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951697600

This paper addresses this issue by focusing on the Témara region in Morocco. The study area was selected for two main reasons. First, it contains numerous caves with Upper Pleistocene deposits, which have yielded remains of anatomically modern humans in association with Aterian and Iberomaurusian artifacts. Second, these caves are currently located on the shore, thus this region is particularly sensitive to major climate change and sea level fluctuations. Diachronic taphonomic study of faunal remains from two sites in the region, El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra caves, shows alternating human/non-human predator occupations. The lower layers of El Mnasra Cave dating to Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 5 have yielded diverse ungulate remains with significant anthropogenic impact marks, together with numerous mollusk shells, Nassarius shell beads, hearths, lithics, some bone tools and used pigments. Faunal remains from the upper layers dating to OIS 4, 3 and 2 of El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra caves, largely dominated by gazelles, provide evidence of carnivore activities, such as tooth marks, numerous semi-digested bones and coprolites alongside some anthropogenic signatures (cut marks and burnt bones). Non-human predators appear to be the main agents responsible for faunal modifications and accumulations. The 'non-intensive' nature of human occupation is confirmed by analyses of the lithic industry at El Harhoura 2. The 'intensive' human occupations date to OIS 5 and could have taken place during wet periods in connection with high sea levels, which allowed the exploitation of shellfish in this area. 'Non-intensive' human occupations generally correspond to arid periods and lower sea levels, during which the Témara area was further inland and may have been less attractive to humans. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Aterian; Carnivores; North Africa; Taphonomy","archaeology; carnivore; cave; climate effect; climate variation; human settlement; occupation; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; predator; settlement history; taphonomy; Morocco; Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer; Temara; animal; bone; cave; climate change; feeding behavior; human; mammal; mollusc; Morocco; paleontology; pathology; physiology; Animals; Bone and Bones; Caves; Climate Change; Food Habits; Humans; Mammals; Mollusca; Morocco; Paleontology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919844350

An updated biochronology of these taxa is established from the middle Miocene to the Holocene. Ten main biozones are defined: they are characterized by specific faunal assemblages, whose evolution and migrations were influenced by geologic and climatic events throughout the studied period. During the Miocene, Myocricetodontinae were dominant. This period was followed by a progressive diversification among Murinae, Gerbillinae, and Crocidurinae from the Plio-Pleistocene onwards, along with sporadic occurrences of European, Asian and sub-Saharan taxa, before a decrease in small mammal diversity at the beginning of the late Pleistocene, while modern faunas stabilized. Overall, the new biochronology matches well with the former ones. However, some slight discrepancies emerge, notably because the former biochronologies were based on more sporadic data and often did not consider the whole small mammal faunas. The present work represents the first complete biochronological synthesis of North African small faunas for the whole late Cenozoic, which should be useful for paleontologists and archeologists in providing an up-to-date framework into which future discoveries will easily find their place. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Holocene; Miocene; Northwestern Africa; Pleistocene; Pliocene; Small mammals","biochronology; biozonation; fossil record; Holocene; migration; Miocene; paleobiology; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; Pliocene; small mammal; species diversity; Algeria; Morocco; Tunisia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885730910

A comparison with taphonomic data from small mammals of the same cave gave more accurate taphonomic and reliable palaeoecological interpretation of the site.

In this respect, the Jaculus jerboas have gained the attention of researchers as a result of their broad Saharan-Arabian distribution and their high and unexplained, morphological, anatomical, and molecular variation. In the present study, mitochondrial and nuclear genealogies where used to confirm monophyly of two cryptic species: Jaculus jaculus and Jaculus deserti. The reconstructed demography showed that the evolutionary histories of the species are markedly different and that the expansion into North-West Africa by J.deserti was more recent than that of J.jaculus. The weak ecological separation between species and the signs of recent population growth and expansion of J.deserti suggest that its sympatric occurrence with J.jaculus is recent and that these species evolved in isolated populations, after diverging around the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary.

During the seventies, the discovery of Palaeolithic human remains associated with Aterian and Upper Palaeolithic artefacts, at Dar es Soltane, El Harhoura 1 and Contrebandiers, have emphasized the interest of the sites in this area. Two caves have been well-studied and are still under excavation: El Mnasra since 1990 and El Harhoura 2 since 2001. The combined ESR-U/Th method applied to fossil herbivorous teeth allows a chronostratigraphical view thanks to guide marks precising the palaeoenvironmental frame in which humans lived during the Palaeolithic period in Morocco. All dated layers are attributed to the Aterian culture. The analyses were performed on bovid fossil teeth unearthed from layers 8, 5 and 4a at El Harhoura 2, and from layers 7, 6a and 6 at El Mnasra. The preliminary results range between 92 and 44 ka for El Haroura2, and between 89 and 66 ka for El Mnasra. These results suggest that caves of Témara region began to be frequented by modern humans from marine isotope stage 5 until 40 ka. The sedimentary record continued later, as evidenced by remains of occupations during Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic found in stratigraphic position.","Combined ESR-U/Th dating; El Harhoura 2; El Mnasra; Fossil teeth; Morocco; Upper Pleistocene","chronology; chronostratigraphy; fossil record; human settlement; Neolithic; Paleolithic; paleontology; Pleistocene; tooth; uranium series dating; Morocco; Rabat; Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer; Temara; Bovidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859595370

An overview of Western Mediterranean Neolithic spread is first given in order to verify the trajectories evinced in European and North African contexts as well as the different models for neolithisation recently proposed in both contexts. A chrono-stratigraphical, economical and technological analysis carried out from coastal (SHM-1) and inland (Doukanet el Khoutifa and Kef Hamda) Tunisian sites is then proposed. New AMS dates offer insights on Upper Capsian development as well as on the Neolithic transition during the 9th and 8th millennium cal BP. Information gathered at SHM-1 and Kef Hamda indicates the acquisition of some specific Neolithic features such as decorated pottery in a hunter-gatherer context dated to 8000 cal BP. Data from Doukanet el Khoutifa hint at a Neolithic productive economy from 7400 cal BP based on pastoral activities and integrating the consumption of wild animals and plants, with no evidence for agriculture. These data confirm the specific North African pathways identified in other local contexts, where an active role of Epipalaeolithic groups is at the basis of the Neolithic transition through an acculturation process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Economy; Neolithic; Pottery; Radiocarbon dating; Tunisia; Upper Capsian","acculturation; archaeological evidence; cultural economy; Neolithic; radiocarbon dating; Maghreb; Tunisia; Animalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953791022

Specimens from Alger and Djelfa (central Algeria) are genetically closer to Moroccan specimens than to east Algerian ones, and the split between these two lineages may have occurred approximately 2.6 Mya. A similar pattern of differentiation was observed in several other species and was hypothesized to be linked to the formation of the fossil island called the 'Edough Peninsula' in eastern Algeria around 4.2 Ma and then to have been reinforced by Pleistocene climatic changes.

The approach is based on the study of pollen content, geochemical elements and grain size analysis. The pollen data indicate that the vegetation was dominated by herbaceous plants until 9000 BP. Such open landscape allowed greater soil erosion and an input of chemical elements from the watershed. After 9000 BP, tree cover, mainly oak, increased slightly and was accompanied by a higher taxonomic diversity. However, several steppe elements remain well represented in the area until 5000 BP, which suggests that the climate was rather dry during the first part of the Holocene. After 6000 BP, the climate became more favourable to expansion of the forest ecosystems, including Cedrus atlantica, thereby reducing erosion. A strong reduction of the tree pollen percentages is recorded after 2000 BP, which may be related to increasing human activities during the Roman period. These forest changes are concomitant with an increase of lead and copper concentrations in the record, probably related to Roman metalworking activities. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cedrus atlantica; Climate; Holocene; Lateglacial; Morocco; Vegetation","environmental change; evergreen forest; evergreen tree; forest dynamics; Holocene; human activity; late glacial; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; pollen; Roman era; sediment; soil erosion; vegetation dynamics; Atlas Mountains; Middle Atlas; Morocco",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904249366

Species confined between various barriers (Atlas Mountains, arid environments such as the Sahara in the south, water masses such as the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west) were generally forced to adapt locally to environmental changes instead of tracking their habitat by shifting their distribution area. The present study aims at providing first insight into the evolution of the genus Mus, and more specifically of the western Mediterranean species Mus spretus in this area. The study relies on the abundant Late Pleistocene and Middle Holocene fossil assemblage from the El Harhoura 2 cave (Rabat-Témara, Morocco). This exceptional record was studied using geometric morphometrics applied to first upper and lower molars, constituting the most informative and best preserved fossil remains for such small rodents. Two main issues were addressed. (1) Geometric morphometrics was used to clarify taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships among fossil and modern species in this area. Morphometric analysis revealed good discrimination of most modern and fossil species but failed to document intermediate forms tracing anagenetic evolution. Not mutually exclusive, the occurrence of complex processes of morphological evolution in this genus such as parallel evolution and the action of stabilizing selection may make it difficult to translate patterns of morphological evolution into phylogenetic conclusions. (2) The record was shown to document a sequence of intraspecific evolution of M.spretus. The morphology of the molars through the fossil record of El Harhoura 2 was surprisingly stable despite extensive modern variation. The limited temporal variation largely failed to correlate to palaeoenvironmental proxies.

Ahl al Oughlam, with more than 100 vertebrate species, is by far the richest paleontological locality of northwestern Africa, but shows that by Late Pliocene, at 2.5Ma, faunas of this region were already less diverse than in eastern Africa. The Thomas and Oulad Hamida quarries yield, in several continental levels interstratified with high-marine transgressive ones, a succession of late Early to Late Pleistocene faunas associated with lithic industries and Homo remains, which greatly help calibrating mammalian evolution in this part of Africa. The Late Pleistocene is also documented by several new sites, all of which, unfortunately, were destroyed before they could be properly excavated. All sites are threatened by urbanisation, emphasising the need for preservation of the few remaining ones. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Mammalian fauna; Morocco; Northwestern africa; Pleistocene; Pliocene","fauna; Miocene; paleontology; Pleistocene; Pliocene; Quaternary; rodent; succession; transgression; vertebrate; Casablanca [Morocco]; Morocco; Spain; Mammalia; Rodentia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953092429

It is therefore a priority to outline the natural variability of continental environments corresponding to a few degrees difference relative to nowadays, in order to define the continental areas at risk and identify the strictly human-induced environmental changes liable to occur in the near future. Thus, maps of the world environments during the last climatic extremes (the Last Glacial Maximum, the Holocene Optimum) corresponding respectively to -4.5 °C and +2 °C relative to present global values, based upon geological multidisciplinary data, were prepared by twelve international level quaternarists at a 1:25 000 000 scale.

Six subspecies were described based on skull features and coat colours, but the validity of these subspecies is uncertain, and no molecular work has ever been conducted on this species. Iran appears to be a key geographical region in which to revise the systematic and evolutionary history of this species, because five of the six subspecies are present in this country. To evaluate the phylogeographical history and taxonomy of this species in Iran, we used a combination of genetic (cytochrome b gene sequences of 70 specimens) and geometric morphometric (2D landmarks on the ventral side of skull of 258 specimens) analyses. We also used ecological niche modelling to make inferences about the evolutionary history of these lineages. Our molecular data highlight the existence of four genetic lineages, but they only partly correspond to the previously described subspecies. Our molecular and morphometric data confirm the validity of M. p. rossicus and show that it has a wider geographical range than previously thought. M. p. gurganensis and M. p. baptistae are genetically very close. The skull of M. p. gurganensis is morphologically distinguishable from other subspecies. The subspecies M. p. persicus and M. p. baptistae are genetically distinct, but morphologically close. Meriones p. ambrosius is genetically close to M. p. persicus, and additional analyses with more specimens are needed to validate its subspecific status. The genetic structure observed in Iran seems to fit the topography and biogeography of the country and emphasize the role of the Abarkooh, Central and Lut deserts as barriers to gene flow. All intraspecific divergent events within the Persian Jird occurred during the last 1.4 My, suggesting that climatic changes probably trigger diversification within this species. Our genetic and species niche modelling results suggest that potential refugial areas persisted during glacial periods for this species in north-western Zagros Mountains, north-eastern Alborz Mountains and Kohrud Mountains. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","Biogeography; cytochrome b; Iran; morphometry; niche modelling","ecological modeling; gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic structure; genetic variation; geographical distribution; geographical region; morphometry; paleobiogeography; population genetics; protein; rodent; skull; subspecies; taxonomy; Afghanistan; Anatolia; Elburz; Iran; Pakistan; Turkey; Zagros; Meriones; Meriones persicus",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84985996083

Reason for this is that several species of similar morphologies are known to occur sympatrically. In the north-west of Iran, four such species occur: Meriones tristrami, Meriones persicus, Meriones vinogradovi and Meriones libycus, prone to several issues of taxonomical ambiguity. A proper characterization of morphological distinctiveness between these species, in relation to the variation within species, could provide the required information for species diagnosis and identification. As some cranial characters of M. tristrami, M. persicus and M. vinogradovi are quite similar, demarcations of species-specific phenotypic variation have proven to be difficult. To tackle this problem, this study involves a geometric morphometric analysis of skull shape and size, incorporating a large representative sample of these four species, originating from most parts of their natural distribution range (especially for M. tristrami). It is first tested whether M. tristrami can be distinguished from the other sympatric species, and if so, to what degree the species shows a geoclimatic pattern in its skull shape and size when comparing different populations. The shape and size analyses show that M. libycus can be distinguished because of its largest skull and the relatively largest tympanic bulla, and that M. tristrami can be distinguished from the other species. At an intraspecific level in M. tristrami, the Iranian groups (Qazvin and west Iran) do not differ in shape among them, but do so in skull size. They could, however, be distinguished in skull shape from the non-Iranian populations included (Turkey and Jordan). To what degree this continuous data can now be translated into discrete and diagnostic features, useful for taxonomic purposes, remains to be studied. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Jird; Morphological variation; Muridae; Rodentia; Skull","biodiversity; cranium; morphology; morphometry; rodent; taxonomy; Iran; Jordan; Turkey; Gerbillinae; Meriones; Meriones libycus; Meriones persicus; Meriones tristrami; Meriones vinogradovi; Muridae; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879889189

In this study, a two-dimensional landmark-based geometric morphometric approach was used to investigate whether patterns in intraspecific variation in skull shape and size exist, using 110 skull specimens from more than 20 different localities along the distribution range of M. meridianus. This is the first study of morphological differences on such a big sample size and geographical range, and it tries to find whether skull shape variation in this species is best described as being clinal or rather reflecting cryptic diversity. The latter seems to be the case, as a dimorphic skull phenotype was found, reflecting a geographic disparity between the Middle East and the Far East specimens both in shape and in size. Distinct cranial differences were found in the overall cranial size and, also at the level of the inflation of the bulla, the elongation of the nasal, the length of the teeth row and the incisive foramen, as well as the distance in between the latter two. It thus seems that M. meridianus from Middle East is morphologically distinct from that of the Far East. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that clinal variation could explain variation within Middle East populations, whereas a more heterogenous pattern is found for those of the Far East. The hypothesis that the observed phenotypic variation may reflect cryptic species is discussed, with the recommendation for a thorough taxonomical revision of the genus in the region. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","Central Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Iran; Muridae; Skull morphology","cranium; crypsis; geographical distribution; geographical variation; intraspecific variation; morphology; morphometry; phenotypic plasticity; rodent; taxonomy; Far East; Middle East; Gerbillinae; Meriones meridianus; Muridae; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859439349

Our study highlights a complex phylogeographic pattern for G. campestris in North Africa, with 9 phylogenetic lineages differing by up to 2.5% of sequence divergence. Most of these lineages are allopatric, except in Morocco where 2 lineages are overlapping in the south. These genetic lineages probably arose during the successive cycles of cooling and warming climatic conditions that characterized the end of the Pleistocene, caused by the combined effects of habitat changes and marine transgressions. The divergence between Saharan and Moroccan populations occurred during a period of aridification at the end of the Pleistocene.

These resources are low in the desert and the rodents are obliged to collect seeds at great distances. In compensation for the low population density, they communicate by specific acoustic signals which their middle ear is specialized to receive.

Given its rich palaeontological record, North Africa is a pertinent region for documenting the role of climate change and human mediated-habitat changes on the demography and genetic structure of faunal species. In the present study, we collected data from this species in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, and we combined molecular (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, microsatellites), fossil, palaeoenvironmental, and human context data to propose an explanation for the fluctuations of populations belonging to the Meriones shawii complex in the past. Genetic and fossil data both indicate a strong bottleneck in Moroccan populations at the Middle Holocene (last interglacial optimum) compared to the Late Pleistocene. Our mitochondrial DNA data suggest a diversification event within Morocco corresponding to the 130-125 kya interglacial optimum. Given that (1) major demographic changes in the M. shawii complex coincide with the interglacial optimums, and (2) the impact of human activities on the landscape and faunal communities was moderate during the Middle Holocene (beginnings of the Neolithic culture), our results demonstrate that climate, rather than anthropogenic influences, likely explains the M. shawii complex population decline in the Holocene. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.","Biogeographical patterns; Fossil calibration; Population genetics; Rodent","calibration; demographic history; fossil record; Holocene; human activity; mitochondrial DNA; paleoenvironment; phylogeography; Pleistocene; population decline; population genetics; rodent; species diversity; Algeria; Morocco; Tunisia; Meriones; Rodentia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951862054

Enlarged bullae are typically shared among species adapted to living in arid habitats. Previous studies suggest that jirds also exhibit this adaptive enlargement of the bulla. However, such claims are based on the observation on a limited number of specimens, and thus they provide no quantitative support for this hypothesis. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis using a combination of geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistical techniques on a large sample of two jird species that exhibit a wide and partially overlapping geographical (and hence climatic) range, i.e., Meriones crassus (Sundevall, 1842) and M. libycus (Lichtenstein, 1823). A total of 485 intact skulls of populations originating from Africa to the eastern Iranian Plateau were analysed. The covariation between auditory bulla shape and several geoclimatic variables was explored using the two-block partial least-squares method. To some degree, the results seem to support the hypothesis that morphological variation in the auditory bulla is, indeed, correlated with geoclimatic variation. However, this finding cannot be generalised at several levels, hence refuting the hypothesis of convergent correlations between geoclimatic conditions and bulla morphology. Species-specific differences were found at different levels, suggesting that if local responses are present, they may reflect interactions with phylogenetic constraints. © 2015 by De Gruyter.","geoclimatic variation; geometric morphometrics; rodent; skull; two-block partial least squares","adaptive management; auditory cue; brain; climate change; convergent evolution; endangered species; environmental conditions; habitat selection; hypothesis testing; least squares method; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; phylogenetics; rodent; size effect; skull; survival; Africa; Iranian Plateau; Mammalia; Meriones; Meriones crassus; Meriones libycus; Muridae; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929092532

Few specific studies have been conducted on fossil small mammals in North Africa, especially for the late Quaternary period. However, the Holocene site of the Guenfouda Cave, situated in the region of Oujda (Eastern Morocco), provides new data on the chronology and the paleoecology of this period. The smallmammal association from Guenfouda comprises at least 12 taxa: two soricomorphs (Crocidura russula and C. whitakeri), one macroscelian (Elephantulus rozeti), two bats (Myotis blythii and Rhinolophus hipposideros) and seven rodents (Mus spretus, Meriones shawii, Apodemus sylvaticus, Dipodillus campestris, Eliomys sp., Atlantoxerus getulus and Ctenodactylus sp.). The absence in our assemblage of species recently introduced to Morocco, such as Mus musculus and Rattus spp. (R. rattus and R. norvegicus), allows us to establish relative data for the beginning of the Holocene (Neolithic) for the Guenfouda Cave in accordance with the archaeological remains recovered.

Moreover, P. papatasi, previously infected with L. major, transmitted the parasite to M. shawi by bite during a second bloodmeal. Two months after the blood-meal, the animal developed a lesion on its ears. Xenodiagnosis was performed on the infected animal.

A detailed understanding of the species contained in these assemblages is important for palaeoecological studies, yet often difficult to achieve because the remains are systematically broken. Here we apply geometric morphometric methods that use sliding landmarks allowing us to assign broken mandibles to five potential species present in Morocco today. Four species were detected, with a distinct distribution in the different levels. Surprisingly, Crocidura russula, a species typically associated with relatively humid habitats, was found to be more abundant in periods characterized by dry conditions. Moreover, the abundance of the Saharan species Crocidura tarfayensis and Crocidura lusitania followed an inverse pattern. Both groups appear to affect each other's abundance throughout the studied period. We suggest that the coastal position of El Harhoura 2 as well as the inter-specific competition between C. russula and other species may explain this pattern. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Fragmentation; Mandible; Palaeoecology; Shrews; Species identification; Taphonomy","archaeological evidence; fossil assemblage; identification key; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; small mammal; specimen bank; taphonomy; abundance; interspecific competition; morphometry; rodent; Morocco; Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer; Temara; Crocidura; Crocidura lusitania; Crocidura russula; Crocidurinae; Soricidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936748603

By using index method to estimate relative abundance (census of active burrows) and pedological analysis of soil granulometry, rates of total and active CaCO3, organic matter and humidity, we searched for correlations between soil characteristics and abundance level. The level of the rodent population is higher when the amounts of sand and total CaCO3 in the soil are high and humidity less than 15 %. On the other hand, the abundance is low and even null when the amounts of clay, active CaCO3 and humidity are high. Thus this study confirms for the first time in Algeria, in cultivated fields, M. shawii's preference for low-humidity sandy soils with high total CaCO3 ; these soils would be more suitable to the species for digging out burrows, thence its higher abundance there. We found no clear relation between the organic matter rate in the soil and the pullulation level. Further studies are required for a better understanding of the role of irrigation and of the demographic cycle of M. shawii in order to better predict and control the relative population abundance of this rodent in the cereal fields.

We demonstrate the strength of these improvements by generating a phylochronology through the genotyping of ancient rodent remains from a Moroccan cave whose stratigraphy covers the last 120 000 years. Rodents are important for epidemiology, agronomy and ecological investigations and can act as bioindicators for human- and/or climate-induced environmental changes. Efficient and reliable genotyping of ancient rodent remains has the potential to deliver valuable phylogenetic and paleoecological information. The analysis of multiple ancient skeletal remains of very small size with poor DNA preservation, however, requires a sensitive high-throughput method to generate sufficient data. We show this approach to be particularly adapted at accessing this otherwise difficult taxonomic and genetic resource. As a highly scalable, lower cost and less labour-intensive alternative to targeted sequence capture approaches, we propose the aMPlex Torrent strategy to be a useful tool for the genetic analysis of multiple degraded samples in studies involving ecology, archaeology, conservation and evolutionary biology. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","ancient DNA; DNA barcoding; ecological genetics; next-generation sequencing; population dynamics; rodents","animal; archeology; classification; DNA barcoding; genotype; high throughput sequencing; Morocco; phylogeny; rodent; Animals; Archaeology; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Genotype; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Morocco; Phylogeny; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978886321

The analysis of 706 pellets resulting from the various stations made it possible to count 1380 individuals, represented by seven classes, 12 orders, 32 families, and 76 species of preys. The mammals are consumed with variable abundance rates between 59.1 % and 90.0 % whose predominance is assigned to the rodents (relative abundance: AR > 58 %). The latter constitute the most advantageous preys in biomass (61.4 ≤ B % ≤ 99.2). The most consumed prey is Meriones shawii, with variable rates between 31.9 % and 76.6 %. Generally, Tyto alba presents a diversified diet in the majority of the stations (0.69 ≤ E ≤ 0.76), except the station of Ain El-Hadjel (E = 0.35), with a low diversity and dominance of M. shawii (AR = 76.6 %). © 2014 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Academie des sciences.","Algeria; Diet; Regurgitation pellets; Rodents; Steppe; Tyto alba","biomass; diet; dominance; predator-prey interaction; raptor; relative abundance; rodent; steppe; Algeria; article; biomass; diet; family; gerbil; Meriones shawii; nonhuman; owl; population abundance; prey; rodent; species diversity; Tyto alba; animal; chemistry; diet; feces; gerbil; nutritional status; owl; physiology; predation; Algeria; Djelfa; Msila; Mammalia; Meriones; Rodentia; Tyto alba; Tytonidae; Algeria; Animals; Diet; Feces; Gerbillinae; Nutritional Status; Predatory Behavior; Rodentia; Strigiformes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903318491
