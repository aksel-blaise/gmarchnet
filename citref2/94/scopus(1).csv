Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

However, the provenance and age of the fossils have been much debated. Here we confirm that the Omo I and Omo II hominid fossils are from similar stratigraphic levels in Member I of the Kibish Formation, despite the view that Omo I is more modern in appearance than Omo II. 40Ar/39Ar ages on feldspar crystals from pumice clasts within a tuff in Member I below the hominid levels place an older limit of 198 ± 14 kyr (weighted mean age 196 ± 2 kyr) on the hominids. A younger age limit of 104 ±7kyr is provided by feldspars from pumice clasts in a Member III tuff. Geological evidence indicates rapid deposition of each member of the Kibish Formation. Isotopic ages on the Kibish Formation correspond to ages of Mediterranean sapropels, which reflect increased flow of the Nile River, and necessarily increased flow of the Omo River. Thus the 40Ar/39Ar age measurements, together with the sapropel correlations, indicate that the hominid fossils have an age close to the older limit. Our preferred estimate of the age of the Kibish hominids is 195 ± 5 kyr, making them the earliest well-dated anatomically modern humans yet described.",,"Crystals; Feldspar; Rivers; Structural geology; Fossils; Homo sapiens; Pumice clasts; Geochronology; argon-argon dating; chronostratigraphy; fossil assemblage; hominid; Pleistocene; skull; age determination; article; correlation analysis; crystal structure; Ethiopia; fossil; geology; hominid; human; human tissue; priority journal; river ecosystem; sapropel; stratigraphy; water flow; chemistry; history; sediment; skull; time; Africa; East Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; Ethiopia; Sub-Saharan Africa; World; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; aluminum silicate; feldspar; potassium derivative; pumice; silicate; Aluminum Silicates; Ethiopia; Fossils; Geologic Sediments; History, Ancient; Humans; Potassium Compounds; Silicates; Skull; Time Factors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-13944279562

A key barrier to the resolution of these questions has been the lack of substantial and accurately dated African hominid fossils from between 100,000 and 300,000 years ago. Here we describe fossilized hominid crania from Herto, Middle Awash, Ethiopia, that fill this gap and provide crucial evidence on the location, timing and contextual circumstances of the emergence of Homo sapiens. Radioisotopically dated to between 160,000 and 154,000 years ago, these new fossils predate classic Neanderthals and lack their derived features. The Herto hominids are morphologically and chronologically intermediate between archaic African fossils and later anatomically modern Late Pleistocene humans. They therefore represent the probable immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans.

Haploid loci like mitochondrial DNA and the nonrecombining part of the Y chromosome show a pattern indicating expansion from a population of only several thousand during the late middle or early upper Pleistocene. Nuclear short tandem repeat loci also show evidence of this expansion. Both mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome coalesce within the last several hundred thousand years, and they cannot provide information about the population before their coalescence. Several nuclear loci are informative about our ancestral population size during nearly the whole Pleistocene. They indicate a small effective size, on the order of 10,000 breeding individuals, throughout this time period.

Here, we describe the characterization of these extinct hominids from a new perspective, based on the development of a Neanderthal metagenomic library and its high-throughput sequencing and analysis. Several lines of evidence indicate that the 65,250 base pairs of hominid sequence so far identified in the library are of Neanderthal origin, the strongest being the ascertainment of sequence identities between Neanderthal and chimpanzee at sites where the human genomic sequence is different. These results enabled us to calculate the human-Neanderthal divergence time based on multiple randomly distributed autosomal loci. Our analyses suggest that on average the Neanderthal genomic sequence we obtained and the reference human genome sequence share a most recent common ancestor ∼706,000 years ago, and that the human and Neanderthal ancestral populations split ∼370,000 years ago, before the emergence of anatomically modern humans. Our finding that the Neanderthal and human genomes are at least 99.5% identical led us to develop and successfully implement a targeted method for recovering specific ancient DNA sequences from metagenomic libraries. This initial analysis of the Neanderthal genome advances our understanding of the evolutionary relationship of Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis and signifies the dawn of Neanderthal genomics.",,"Ecology; Ecosystems; Genes; Population statistics; Hominids; Homo sapiens; Metagenomic library; Neanderthals; DNA sequences; genomic DNA; DNA; hominid; Neanderthal; article; chimpanzee; chromosome size; DNA determination; DNA sequence; high throughput screening; hominid; human; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Animals; Bone and Bones; Cell Nucleus; DNA; DNA, Mitochondrial; Evolution; Fossils; Gene Pool; Genome; Genome, Human; Genomic Library; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Pan troglodytes; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Pan troglodytes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751073995

Here, we examine cranial variation among Pleistocene and recent human fossils by using a model of cranial growth to identify unique derived features (autapomorphies) that reliably distinguish fossils attributed to ""anatomically modern"" H. sapiens (AMHS) from those attributed to various taxa of ""archaic"" Homo spp. (AH) and to test hypotheses about the changes in cranial development that underlie the origin of modern human cranial form. In terms of pattern, AMHS crania are uniquely characterized by two general structural autapomorphies: facial retraction and neurocranial globularity. Morphometric analysis of the ontogeny of these autapomorphies indicates that the developmental changes that led to modern human cranial form derive from a combination of shifts in cranial base angle, cranial fossae length and width, and facial length. These morphological changes, some of which may have occurred because of relative size increases in the temporal and possibly the frontal lobes, occur early in ontogeny, and their effects on facial retraction and neurocranial globularity discriminate AMHS from AH crania. The existence of these autapomorphies supports the hypothesis that AMHS is a distinct species from taxa of ""archaic"" Homo (e.g., Homo neanderthalensis).",,"article; evolution; face development; fossil; human; morphometrics; ontogeny; priority journal; skull base; skull development; Animals; Evolution; Hominidae; Humans; Skull; Crania; Homo; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037022224

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption. We consider the implications of these findings in terms of the potential for these approaches in the study of comparative growth in related species.","Facial remodelling; Geometric morphometrics; Thin plate spline analysis","age; allometry; article; cercocebus; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; face growth; female; geometry; male; molar tooth; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; sex difference; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Anthropometry; Bone Remodeling; Cercocebus; Facial Bones; Female; Male; Models, Anatomic; Sex Characteristics; Cercocebus; Cercocebus torquatus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031724058

The phenetic affinities of the Sima de los Huesos crania and a large sample of Homo fossils are investigated through principal component analyses. Metrical comparisons of the Sima de los Huesos and other European and African Middle Pleistocene fossils with Neandertals are performed using Z-scores relative to the Neandertal sample statistics. The most relevant cranial traits are metrically and morphologically analyzed and cladistically evaluated. The Sima de los Huesos crania exhibit a number of primitive traits lost in Upper Pleistocene Neandertals (especially in the braincase, but also in the facial skeleton), as well as other traits that are transitional to the Neandertal morphology (particularly in the occipital bone), and features close to what is found in Neandertals (as the supraorbital morphology and midfacial prognathism). Different combinations of primitive and derived traits (shared with Neandertals) are also displayed by the other European Middle Pleistocene fossils. In conclusion, the Sima de los Huesos sample is evolutionarily related to Neandertals as well as to the other European Middle Pleistocene fossils. In our opinion, all the European Middle Pleistocene fossils belong to the Neandertal lineage, and none can be included in an Afroeuropean common ancestor of Neandertals and modern humans. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Atapuerca; Crania; Middle Pleistocene; Morphometrics; Sima de los Huesos","Crania; Animalia; Crania; Hominidae; Primates; cranial morphology; hominid; morphometrics; Pleistocene; adult; analysis of variance; animal; article; cephalometry; child; classification; comparative study; dentition; evolution; face; facial bone; fossil; histology; hominid; human; male; methodology; multivariate analysis; paleontology; physical anthropology; skull; Spain; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Cephalometry; Child; Dentition; Evolution; Face; Facial Bones; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Paleodontology; Paleontology; Skull; Spain; Spain, Castilla y Leon, Burgos, Sierra de Atapuerca",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031202616

This conclusion has had implications for the study of human variation and consideration of alternative models for the origin of modern humans. By contrast, it has often been assumed that the level of among‐group variation for morphological traits is much higher. This study examines the level of among‐group variation based on Craniometric data from a large sample of modern humans originally collected by W. W. Howells. A multivariate method based on quantitative genetics theory was used to provide an estimate of FST — a measure of among‐group variation that can be compared with results from studies of genetic markers. Data for 57 Craniometric variables on 1,734 crania were analyzed. These data represent six core areas: Europe, Sub‐Saharan Africa, Australasia, Polynesia, the Americas, and the Far East. An additional set of analyses was performed using a three‐region subset (Europe, Sub‐Saharan Africa, and the Far East) to provide comparability with several genetic studies. The minimum FST (assuming complete heritability) for the three‐region analysis is 0.065, and the minimum FST for the six‐region analysis is 0.085. Both of these are less than the average FST from genetic studies (average estimates of 0.10–0.11). The smaller value of the minimum FST estimates is expected since it provides an estimate of FST expected under complete heritability. Using an estimate of average craniometric heritability from the literature provides an estimate of FST of 0.112 for the three‐region analysis and 0.144 for the six‐region analysis. These results show that genetic and craniometric data are in agreement, qualitatively and quantitatively, and that there is limited variation in modern humans among major geographic regions. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Their origin likely relates to an episode of recolonization of Western Eurasia by hominins of African origin carrying the Acheulean technology into Europe around 600 ka. An enhancement of both glacial and interglacial phases may have played a crucial role in this event, as well as in the subsequent evolutionary history of the Western Eurasian populations. In addition to climatic adaptations and an increase in encephalization, genetic drift seems to have played a major role in their evolution. To date, a clear speciation event is not documented, and the most likely scenario for the fixation of Neandertal characteristics seems to be an accretion of features along the second half of the MP. Although a separation time for the African and Eurasian populations is difficult to determine, it certainly predates OIS 11 as phenotypic Neandertal features are documented as far back as and possibly before this time. It is proposed to use the term ""Homo rhodesiensis"" to designate the large-brained hominins ancestral to H. sapiens in Africa and at the root of the Neandertals in Europe, and to use the term ""Homo neanderthalensis"" to designate all of the specimens carrying derived metrical or non-metrical features used in the definition of the LP Neandertals.","Acheulean; Climate; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Pleistocene","Africa; climate; Europe; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; genetic drift; hominid; Homo antecessor; homo erectus; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo neanderthalensis; homo sapiens; human; paleontology; phenotypic variation; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; review; species differentiation; Upper Pleistocene; animal; article; classification; fossil; histology; methodology; physical anthropology; population dynamics; time; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Africa; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Europe; Evolution; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349482681

The purpose of morphometric studies is considered, together with issues relating to the nature, significance and identification of landmarks before turning to a review of available technologies for the analysis of morphological variation. These are considered in terms of underlying models and assumptions in order to clarify when each is appropriate. To illustrate the application of these methods, 3 example studies are presented. The first examines differences amongst ancient and modern adult human crania using 2-dimensional data. The second illustrates the extension of these methods into 3 dimensions in a study of facial growth in monkeys. The third presents an application to the analysis of the form of the hominoid talus. The review ends with an account of available software resources for shape analysis.","Facial variation; Geometric morphometrics; Sexual dimorphism; Shape analysis; Talus","bone development; bone scintiscanning; comparative anatomy; compartment model; computer assisted tomography; craniofacial morphology; evolution; fossil; geometry; human; image analysis; image reconstruction; monkey; morphometrics; nonhuman; priority journal; review; sex difference; species difference; talus; Adult; Animals; Evolution; Fossils; Haplorhini; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Anatomic; Paleontology; Sex Characteristics; Skull; Talus; Crania; Hominidae; Hominoidea; Primates",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033852603

Overall, among-population differences in extant Homo sapiens cranial morphology are proportional to among-population differences in neutral molecular characteristics. For most of the populations studied, cranial morphology varies among regions in a manner consistent with neutral expectations. Removal of the effects of shared population history and structure by using the partial Mantel's test, however, does not remove the correlation between some aspects of cranial morphology and a measure of coldness of climate. The excess differentiation is most apparent in those population comparisons that involve a Siberian population living in an extremely cold environment. This finding suggests the action of natural selection, associated with regional variation in temperature, leading to among-population differentiation in excess of neutral expectations for some cranial dimensions. Those dimensions reflect the breadth of the skull, cranial vault size and shape, and aspects of nasal morphology.

Some cranial regions, particularly the face and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because different cranial regions preserve population history and climate signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate adaptation; Craniofacial morphology; Human variation; Neutral genetics; Population history","accuracy; article; climate; correlation analysis; evolution; face; female; genetic distance; geometry; history; human; human tissue; hypothesis; male; morphology; morphometrics; normal human; phylogeny; population research; priority journal; reliability; skull; temporal bone; Acclimatization; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Climate; Continental Population Groups; Evolution; Face; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Temporal Bone; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845396793

A model is presented for developmental interactions that occur during ontogeny between the brain and the cranial base and neurocranium, and between the neurobasicranial complex (NBC) and the face. The model is tested using exocranial and radiographic measurements of adult crania sampled from five geographically and craniometrically diverse populations. The results indicate that while variations in the breadth, length and flexion of the cranial base are mutually independent, only the maximum breadth of the cranial base (POB) has significant effects on overall cranial proportions, largely through its interactions with brain volume which influence NBC breadth. These interactions also have a slight influence on facial shape because NBC width constrains facial width, and because narrow-faced individuals tend to have antero-posteriorly longer faces relative to facial breadth than wide-faced individuals. Finally, the model highlights how integration between the cranial base and the brain may help to account for the developmental basis of some morphological variations such as occipital bunning. Among modern humans, the degree of posterior projection of the occipital bone appears to be a consequence of having a large brain on a relatively narrow cranial base. Occipital buns in Neanderthals, who have wide cranial bases relative to endocranial volume, may not be entirely homologous with the morphology occasionally evident in Homo sapiens.","Basicranium; Cranium; Integration; Neurocranium; Occipital bun; Skull","morphometry; skull; Crania; Hominidae; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034070524

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is widely recognized that a considerable endocranial expansion occurred throughout the evolution of the genus Homo. This article aims to evaluate whether this phenomenon was the outcome of distinct evolutionary lineages, reaching similar brain expansions but through different trajectories. Endocranial morphology was studied in a sample of fossil hominines by multivariate approaches using both traditional metrics and geometric morphometrics. The analysis was focused on the transition from a generalized archaic pattern within the genus Homo to the modern morphology and compared with changes that occurred along the Neandertal lineage. The main result was the identification of two different evolutionary trajectories, in which a similar expansion in endocranial size has been reached by different changes in shape. Along the Neandertal lineage we observed maintenance of an ""archaic"" endocranial model, in which a large amount of variability is based on a single allometric trend. By contrast, when modern endocasts were compared with nonmodern ones, we found important differences apparently led by a parietal expansion. In this light, the origin of our species may have represented the opportunity to surpass the constraints imposed on encephalization by the ontogenetic pattern shared by nonmodern Homo representatives.",,"allometry; article; body size; brain size; dura mater; encephalization; evolution; fossil; human; morphology; morphometrics; ontogeny; priority journal; skull; Animals; Brain; Evolution; Fossils; Geography; Hominidae; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Paleontology; Skull; User-Computer Interface; Homo",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347364653

If the Skhul burials took place within a relatively short time span, then the best age estimate lies between 100 and 135 ka. This result agrees very well with TL ages obtained from burnt flint of 119±18 ka (Mercier et al., 1993). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the material associated with the Skhul IX burial is older than those of Skhul II and Skhul V. These and other recent age estimates suggest that the three burial sites, Skhul, Qafzeh and Tabun are broadly contemporaneous, falling within the time range of 100 to 130 ka. The presence of early representatives of both early modern humans and Neanderthals in the Levant during Marine Isotope Stage 5 inevitably complicates attempts at segregating these populations by date or archaeological association. Nevertheless, it does appear that the oldest known symbolic burials are those of early modern humans at Skhul and Qafzeh. This supports the view that, despite the associated Middle Palaeolithic technology, elements of modern human behaviour were represented at Skhul and Qafzeh prior to 100 ka. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the reliability of these hypotheses has never been subjected to external validation. To rectify this, we applied identical methods to equivalent evidence from two groups of extant higher primates for whom reliable molecular phylogenies are available, the hominoids and papionins. We found that the phylogenetic hypotheses based on the craniodental data were incompatible with the molecular phylogenies for the groups. Given the robustness of the molecular phylogenies, these results indicate that little confidence can be placed in phylogenies generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence. The corollary of this is that existing phylogenetic hypotheses about human evolution are unlikely to be reliable.

We report here on new high-precision dates on the recently discovered speleothem SRA-3 overlaying human bones within the Sima de los Huesos. Earlier analyses of this speleothem by TIMS (thermal-ionization mass-spectrometry) showed the lower part to be indistinguishable from internal isotopic equilibrium at the precision of the TIMS instrumentation used, yielding minimum age of 350 kyr (kyr = 103 yr before present). Reanalysis of six samples of SRA-3 by inductively-coupled plasma-multicollector mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) produced high-precision analytical results allowing calculation of finite dates. The new dates cluster around 600 kyr. A conservative conclusion takes the lower error limit ages as the minimum age of the speleothem, or 530 kyr. This places the SH hominids at the very beginnings of the Neandertal evolutionary lineage.","Atapuerca; Middle Pleistocene; Neandertal; Sima de los Huesos; Uranium-series","evolution; hominid; mass spectrometry; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; skeletal remains; speleothem; uranium series dating; Burgos [Castilla y Leon]; Castilla y Leon; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; Hominidae; Ursus; Ursus spelaeus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845809154

While there is considerable comparative evidence to support this idea, most experimental tests of this hypothesis have been on non-human primates or other very prognathic mammals (rodents, swine) raised on hard versus very soft (nearly liquid) diets. Here, we examine facial growth and in vivo strains generated in response to raw/dried foods versus cooked foods in a retrognathic mammal, the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis). The results indicate that the hyrax cranium resembles the non-human primate cranium in having a steep gradient of strains from the occlusal to orbital regions, but differs from most non-anthropoids in being primarily twisted; the hyrax mandible is bent both vertically and laterally. In general, higher strains, as much as two-fold at some sites, are generated by masticating raw versus cooked food. Hyraxes raised on cooked food had significantly less growth (approximately 10%) in the ventral (inferior) and posterior portions of the face, where strains are highest, resembling many of the differences evident between humans raised on highly processed versus less processed diets. The results support the hypothesis that food processing techniques have led to decreased facial growth in the mandibular and maxillary arches in recent human populations. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This assumption also seems to apply for the Early and Middle Pleistocene populations, whose presence in Europe has been largely explained by a discontinuous flow of African emigrant waves. Only recently, some voices have speculated about the possibility of Asia being a center of speciation. However, no hard evidence has been presented to support this hypothesis. We present evidence from the most complete and up-to-date analysis of the hominin permanent dentition from Africa and Eurasia. The results show important morphological differences between the hominins found in both continents during the Pleistocene, suggesting that their evolutionary courses were relatively independent.

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549154351

Many studies of human populations have applied the isolation-by-distance model to genetic variation between local populations in a limited geographic area, but few have done so on a global level, and these few used different models and analytical methods. I assess genetic variation between human populations across the world using data on red blood cell polymorphisms, microsatellite DNA markers, and craniometric traits. The isolation-by-distance model provides an excellent fit to average levels of genetic similarity within geographic distance classes for all three data sets, and the rate of distance decay is the same in all three. These results suggest that a common pattern of global gene flow mediated by geographic distance is detectable in diverse genetic and morphological data. An alternative explanation is that the correspondence between genetic similarity and geographic distance reflects the history of dispersal of the human species out of Africa.","Craniometrics; Gene flow; Isolation by distance; Microsatellite DNA; Red blood cell polymorphisms","microsatellite DNA; Africa; article; controlled study; craniometry; erythrocyte; female; gene flow; gene frequency; genetic isolation by distance; genetic polymorphism; genetic similarity; genetic variability; human; male; microsatellite marker; morphology; Cephalometry; Erythrocytes; Evolution; Gene Frequency; Genetic Markers; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Genetic; Social Isolation; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-13244282967

Two of the most pressing problems are redundancy of traits due to similarity of underlying function and overrepresentation of some anatomical or functional systems in trait lists. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, we collapse our list of 77 traits into sets of traits using two methods. The first method segregates traits into seven groups by anatomical region. The second method segregates traits by function into five complexes which correspond fairly well with recognized trends in the evolution of early hominids (adaptation for heavy chewing, reduction of the anterior dentition, basicranial flexion, increased orthognathism and encephalization). The most parsimonious cladogram describing the relationships among the early hominid species obtained using the original 77 traits or the summary scores from the functional complexes, places Australopithecus afarensis as a sister group to all other hominids. Australopithecus aethiopicus occupies the next branch, leaving A. africanus, A. robustus, A. boisei and Homo as a monophyletic group. The cladogram next separates A. africanus from the remaining hominids and finally divides Homo from A. robustus and A. boisei. Summary scores for anatomical regions produced three equally parsimonious cladograms, one of which was identical to that described above. This result implies that there was a large amount of parallelism in hominid evolution, and that adaptations for heavy chewing evolved separately in the lineage leading to A. aethiopicus and in the lineage leading to A. robustus and A. boisei. Another implication is that Homo descended from an A. africanus-like ancestor and diverged from A. robustus and A. boisei relatively late in hominid evolution by reducing the extent of its adaptation to heavy chewing. Most current phylogenies are not compatible with the cladogram obtained in this study, but are instead compatible with a cladogram obtained when traits related to heavy chewing are used exclusively. The ""heavy chewing"" cladogram reverses the positions of A. aethiopicus and Homo. Perhaps the reason why most current cladograms resemble the ""heavy chewing"" cladogram is the over-representation of traits related to heavy chewing in most trait lists. © 1992.","Australopithecus; cladistics; functional complexes; Homo; phylogenetic analysis; Plio-Pleistocene hominids","Australopithecus; cladistic analysis; evolution; hominid; Homo",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027062347

This reorganization renders the infraorbital facial plates more efficient in opposing the rotation of the snout in the sagittal plane, which in turn is generated by the unusual use of the anterior teeth. The triangular shape that the ""sagittally"" oriented infraorbital plate assumes is considered the result of its greater efficiency in opposing the rotation of the anterior part of the face. Both the shift from the coronal into the sagittal orientation and the reshaping of the bone plate into a triangle with a specific anteroposterior length to achieve optimal proportions act to produce the unusual mid-facial prognathism in the Neanderthal skull. © 1986 Academic Press Inc.

Recent consensus views cranial morphology as largely indicative of population history in humans, with some anatomical cranial regions/measurements being more informative on population history, while others being under selection pressure. We test earlier findings using the largest and most diverse cranial dataset available as yet: 7,423 male specimens from 135 geographic human population samples represented by 33 standard craniometric linear measurements. We calculated Mahalanobis D 2 for three datasets: complete cranial dataset; facial measurement dataset; and neurocranial measurement dataset; these morphological distance matrices were then compared to matrices of geographic distances as well as of several climatic variables. Additionally, we calculated Fst values for our cranial measurements and compared the results to the expected Fst values for neutral genetic loci. Our findings support the hypothesis that cranial, and especially neurocranial morphology, is phylogenetically informative, and that aspects of the face and cranium are subject to selection related to climatic factors. The Fst analysis suggest that selection to climate is largely restricted to groups living in extremely cold environments, including Northeast Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, though each of these regions appears to have arrived at their morphology through distinct adaptive pathways. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adaptation; Craniometrics; Fst; Human variation; Neanderthals; Population history","anatomical variation; article; climate; controlled study; data base; geography; human; human tissue; male; morphology; phylogeny; population; population differentiation; priority journal; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Asia; Cephalometry; Climate; Cold Climate; Europe; Evolution; Facial Bones; Fossils; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Male; North America; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Population; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449643229

Proponents of the single-origin model often view this group as a distinct species with little or no contribution to the evolution of modern humans. Adherents to the regional continuity model consider Neanderthals a subspecies or population of Homo sapiens, which contributed significantly to the evolution of early modern Europeans. Paleontologists generally agree that fossil species should be equivalent to extant ones in the amount of their morphological variation. Recognition of fossil species therefore hinges on analogy to living species. A previous study by one of the authors and recent work by other researchers [Schillachi, M. A. & Froelich, J. W. (2001) Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 115, 157-166] have supported specific status for Neanderthals based on analogy to chimpanzees and Sulawesi macaques, respectively. However, these taxa may not be the most appropriate models for Pleistocene humans. Here we test the hypothesis that Neanderthals represent a subspecies of H. sapiens by comparing the degree of their morphological differentiation from modern humans to that found within and between 12 species of extant primates. The model taxa comprised >1,000 specimens, including phylogenetic (modern humans and African apes) and ecological (eight papionin taxa) models for Pleistocene humans.

The study of dental development facilitates assessment of growth and development in fossil hominins with greater precision than other skeletal analyses. During tooth formation, biological rhythms manifest in enamel and dentine, creating a permanent record of growth rate and duration. Quantification of these internal and external incremental features yields developmental benchmarks, including ages at crown completion, tooth eruption, and root completion. Molar eruption is correlated with other aspects of life history. Recent evidence for developmental differences between modern humans and Neanderthals remains ambiguous. By measuring tooth formation in the entire dentition of a juvenile Neanderthal from Scladina, Belgium, we show that most teeth formed over a shorter time than in modern humans and that dental initiation and eruption were relatively advanced. By registering manifestations of stress across the dentition, we are able to present a precise chronology of Neanderthal dental development that differs from modern humans. At 8 years of age at death, this juvenile displays a degree of development comparable with modern human children who are several years older. We suggest that age at death in juvenile Neanderthals should not be assessed by comparison with modern human standards, particularly those derived from populations of European origin. Moreover, evidence from the Scladina juvenile and other similarly aged hominins suggests that a prolonged childhood and slow life history are unique to Homo sapiens. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Hominin; Human evolution; Life history; Ontogeny; Tooth growth","article; Belgium; biological rhythm; dentin; enamel; evolution; fossil; human; life history; molar tooth; Paleolithic; priority journal; tooth development; tooth eruption; Animals; Belgium; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Life; Odontogenesis; Paleodontology; Tooth; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-38049186656

Among the principal difficulties in these evaluations is the absence of discrete, discernible, and comparable anatomical structures for rigorous quantitative assessment. Previous research has addressed either internal crown surface features (such as cusps and fossae) or the morphology of the crown outline. In the present paper, we integrate both types of information in the examination of morphological variation of lower P4s (n = 96) among various fossil hominin species with an emphasis on genus Homo. We use a set of 34 2D landmarks combining coordinate data from four classical dental landmarks on the occlusal surface and 30 sliding semilandmarks of the crown outline. Our results indicate that external shape variation is closely related to the configuration of the occlusal morphological features and influenced by dental size. The external and internal shapes of P4 are polymorphic but still useful in depicting a primitive-derived gradient. The primitive pattern seems to have been an asymmetrical contour with a mesially displaced metaconid, development of a bulging talonid, and a broad occlusal polygon. The trend toward dental reduction during the Pleistocene produced different morphological variants with a reduced occlusal polygon and decreased lingual occlusal surface in later Homo species. Homo heidelbergensis/neanderthalensis have fixed plesiomorphic traits in high percentages, whereas in modern humans a symmetrical outline with a centered metaconid and talonid reduction evolved. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This consensus has emerged in the last two decades, as molecular evidence has been coupled with findings from paleontology and prehistory. Patterns of DNA variation in living populations, morphology of fossils, and archeological traces can all be read to show that our species has deep roots in Africa and began to disperse into other regions only late in the Pleistocene. There are still questions about the timing of these dispersals and the extent to which modern people replaced or exchanged genes with other, more archaic groups, but new problems are now coming more clearly into focus. These relate to the ancestry of Homo sapiens in the Middle Pleistocene. In this essay, I emphasize the evidence available from Middle Pleistocene localities in Africa and Europe, exploring variation among individuals, composition of hypodigms, species-level taxonomy, and evolutionary relationships of the hominin populations. One obvious difficulty is that the fossils are scarce. For the most part, only incomplete crania are available from African localities. The record is more comprehensive for the Sima de los Huesos in Spain, but principally crania and jaws are known from other European sites. This means that skull traits and measurements must provide the basis for sorting individuals to groups and building differential diagnoses. For much of the material, dating is still poorly controlled, although a few of the most important assemblages can now be placed more securely within a Middle Pleistocene chronological framework. Despite these constraints, it is possible to point toward tentative solutions.","Cranial form; Homo heidelbergensis; Human evolution; Neanderthals; Phylogeny; Systematics","Crania; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41549141344

Usually these analyses have been performed by means of classic morphometric methods, including the measurement of relative cusp areas or the angles defined between cusps. Although these studies have provided valuable information for the morphological characterization of some hominin species, we believe that the analysis of this particular tooth could be more conclusive for taxonomic assignment. In this study, we have applied geometric morphometric methods to explore the morphological variability of the upper first molar (M1) across the human fossil record. Our emphasis focuses on the study of the phenetic relationships among the European middle Pleistocene populations (designated as H. heidelbergensis) with H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, but the inclusion of Australopithecus and early Homo specimens has helped us to assess the polarity of the observed traits. H. neanderthalensis presents a unique morphology characterized by a relatively distal displacement of the lingual cusps and protrusion in the external outline of a large and bulging hypocone. This morphology can be found in a less pronounced degree in the European early and middle Pleistocene populations, and reaches its maximum expression with the H. neanderthalensis lineage. In contrast, modern humans retain the primitive morphology with a square occlusal polygon associated with a round external outline. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This nomen, formulated by Schoetensack in 1908 to describe the Mauer jaw (Germany), was almost forgotten during most of the past century. Numerous fossils have been attributed to it but no consensus has arisen concerning their classification. The holotype anatomical traits are still poorly understood, and numerous fossils with no mandibular remains have been placed in the taxon. Some researchers propose H. heidelbergensis as an Afro-European taxon that is ancestral to both modern humans and Neandertals whereas others think it is a strictly European species that is part of the Neandertal lineage. We focus on the validity of H. heidelbergensis, using the traditional basis of species recognition: anatomical description. We provide a comparative morphological analysis using 47 anatomical traits of 36 Pleistocene fossils from Africa, Asia, and Europe and 35 extant human mandibles. We re-examine the mandibular features of Mauer and discuss the specimen's inclusion in H. heidelbergensis, as well as alternative evolutionary theories. To lend objectivity to specimen grouping, we use multiple correspondence analysis associated with hierarchical classification that creates clusters corresponding to phenetic similarities between jaws. Our phenetic and comparative morphological analyses support the validity of H. heidelbergensis as a taxon. A set of morphological features can be statistically identified for the definition of the species. Some traits can be used to delimit H. heidelbergensis in an evolutionary framework (e.g., foramina mentale posteriorly positioned, horizontal retromolar surface). Those traits are also present on African (e.g., Tighenif) and European (e.g., Sima de los Huesos) specimens that show a close relationship with the Mauer mandible. Therefore, the definition of H. heidelbergensis is more precise and mainly supports the theory of an Afro-European taxon, which is the last common ancestor of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. However, the results of this study fail to entirely discount the hypothesis that considers H. heidelbergensis as a chronospecies leading to the Neandertals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The specimen consists of two complete parietals, most of the right temporal, and 70% of the occipital. The specimen displays several features characteristic of early 'archaic' Homo sapiens: maximum breadth at the supramastoid crests, roughly pentagonal occipital view, an angular torus, superoinferiorly elongate/anteroposterior shortened aquamous temporal, strong masteroid, and separation of the tympanic and mastoid temporal portions. Other features align the Reilingen cranium with the 'classic' Neandertals: developed suprainiac fossa, bilaterally protuberant occipital torus, strong juxtamastoid eminence, a highly convex occipital plane, and lambdoid flattening. This morphology and our cephalometric analysis support the assignment of this specimen to a Stage 2 'pre-Neandertal' group (e.g., Steinheim, Swanscombe, and Atapuerca [SH site]). Following an 'Accretion Model' of European hominid evolution, Stage 2 succeeds Strage 1 European 'early-pre-Neandertals' (e.g., Mauer and Petralona), and precedes both the Saale-Eem Stage 3 'early Neandertals' (e.g., Biache 1), which present greater platycephaly, a reduced mastoid process, an enlarged juxtamastoid eminence, and true 'en-bombe' (parieto-occipital form), and Weichsel Stage 4 'Neandertals' (sensu stricto, i.e., 'classic' Neadertals).",,"evolution; Homo sapiens; Neanderthal; phylogeny; Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany; Reilingen; Animalia; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032071342

In turn, this has led to suggestions that the temporal bone is particularly reliable in analyses of primate phylogeny and human population history. While several reasons have been suggested to explain the temporal bone's strong fit with neutral expectation, the temporal bone has never systematically been compared against other individual cranial bones defined using the same biological criteria. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the shapes of all cranial bones possess reliable information regarding neutral genetic evolution, or whether the temporal bone is unique in this respect. This study tests the hypothesis that the human temporal bone is more congruent with neutral expectation than six other individual cranial bones by correlating population affinity matrices generated using neutral genetic and 3D craniometric data. The results demonstrate that while the temporal bone shows the absolute strongest correlation with neutral genetic data compared with all other bones, it is not statistically differentiated from the sphenoid, frontal, and parietal bones in this regard. Potential reasons for the temporal bone's consistently strong fit with neutral expectation, such as its overall anatomical complexity and/or its contribution to the architecture of the basicranium, are examined. The results suggest that future phylogenetic and taxonomic studies would benefit from considering the shape of the entire cranium minus those regions that deviate most from neutrality. ©2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Neutral evolution; Population history; Temporal bone","article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; frontal bone; human; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phylogeny; physical anthropology; population genetics; primate; skull; sphenoid; temporal bone; Bone Development; Classification; Fossils; Gene Frequency; Genetic Markers; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Skull; Temporal Bone; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349102576

It encompasses the posterior projection/convexity of the occipital squama and is associated with lambdoid flattening on the parietal. A 'hemibun' in some Upper Paleolithic Europeans is thought by some authors to indicate interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern Europeans. However, 'bunning' is difficult to measure, and the term has been applied to a range of morphological patterns. Furthermore, its usefulness in phylogenetic reconstruction and its homologous status across modern and fossil humans have been disputed. We present a geometric morphometric study that quantitatively evaluates the chignon, assesses its usefulness in separating Neanderthals from modern humans, and its degree of similarity to Upper Paleolithic 'hemibuns.' We measured the three-dimensional coordinates of closely spaced points along the midsagittal plane from bregma to inion and of anatomical landmarks in a large series of recent human crania and several Middle and Late Pleistocene European and African fossils. These coordinate data were processed using the techniques of geometric morphometrics and analyzed with relative warps, canonical variates, and singular warps. Our results show no separation between Neanderthals and modern humans, including early modern Europeans, when the shape of the occipital plane midsagittal-profile is considered alone. On the other hand, Neanderthals are well separated from both recent and fossil modern humans when information about the occipital's relative position and relative size are also included. Furthermore, the occurrence of a highly convex and posteriorly projecting midline occipital profile (interpreted as the occipital bun) is highly correlated (>0.8) with a flat parietal midsagittal profile and with antero-superiorly positioned temporal bones across both our recent and our fossil human samples. We conclude that the shape of the occipital profile alone should not be considered an independent trait, as it is very tightly integrated with braincase shape. Our analysis does not support differences in integration of the posterior midsagittal profile and the cranial base in Pleistocene and recent humans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assessed the phylogenetic utility of six different human cranial regions, plus the entire cranium. Three-dimensional landmark data were collected for 83 landmarks from samples of skulls from 14 modern human populations. The data were subsequently divided into anatomical regions: basicranium, upper face, mandible, temporal bone, upper jaw, cranial vault, and a subset of points from around the entire cranium. Depictions of population molecular distances were calculated using published data on microsatellites for the same or closely related populations. Distances based on morphological variation of each of the anatomical regions were compared with molecular distances, and the correlations assessed. The morphology of the basicranium, temporal bone, upper face, and entire cranium demonstrated the highest correlations with molecular distances. The morphology of the mandible, upper jaw, and cranial vault, as measured here, were not significantly correlated with molecular distances. As the three-dimensional morphology of the temporal bone, upper face, basicranium, and entire cranium appear to consistently reflect genetic relationships in humans, especially with more reliability than the cranial vault, it would be preferable to focus on these regions when attempting to determine the genetic relationships of human specimens with no molecular data. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"anatomical variation; article; craniofacial morphology; epigenetics; human; maxilla; microsatellite marker; molecular biology; morphological trait; phylogeny; physical anthropology; population genetics; priority journal; reliability; temporal bone; three dimensional imaging; Anthropology, Physical; Continental Population Groups; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Humans; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-59549091063

Previous descriptions of human mandibles showed variation in ramal height and breadth to be the strongest difference among recent human groups. Several mandibular traits that differentiate Neanderthals from modern humans include greater robusticity, a receding symphysis, a large retromolar space, a rounder gonial area, an asymmetric mandibular notch, and a posteriorly positioned mental foramen in Neanderthals. Nevertheless, the degree to which these differences are part of modern human variation and/or are related to size and function remains unclear. The aim of this study was to document geographic and functional patterning in the mandibular shape of recent humans, to assess the effects of allometry on mandibular form, and to quantitatively evaluate proposed ""Neanderthai"" mandibular traits through comparison with samples of geographically diverse recent humans. Data were collected in the form of three-dimensional coordinates of 28 landmarks. Unlike previous studies, this analysis found that modern human mandibular shape exhibits considerable geographic patterning, with some aspects of mandibular morphology reflecting a climatic gradient, and others, a functional specialization. Population history is also reflected in mandibular form, albeit relatively weakly. Proposed ""Neanderthal"" traits were found to separate Neanderthal from modern human mandibles successfully in the statistical analysis. Of these, the retromolar gap was found to be related to increased mandibular size in modern humans. The status of this trait as a Neanderthal autapomorphy should therefore be treated with caution. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate; Modern human variation; Neanderthals; Paramasticatory behavior","allometry; article; bone structure; geometry; history; human; mandible; morphometrics; physical anthropology; population biology; quantitative analysis; three dimensional imaging; Anatomy, Comparative; Animals; Arctic Regions; Asia; Europe; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mandible; Paleodontology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750063463

All elements are briefly described anatomically with metrics and compared with other fossil hominids in order to establish the morphological pattern of the SH hominids. A minimum of 13 individuals are represented by the humeri in the SH sample. Almost all of them can be classified as adolescents and young adults. The morphology of the SH hominid shoulder girdle and humeri indicates that much of the shoulder morphology recognized in the later true Neandertal was present in Europe long before they appeared. Thus, this morphological pattern is not exclusive to Neandertals alone. The SH clavicles, scapulae and humeri share with the Neandertals many traits usually considered to be Neandertal specializations.

The site has also provided nearly 13,000 mammalian bones that can be identified to skeletal part and taxon. The assemblage derives from 49 species, 15 of which have no historic descendants. Comparisons to radiometrically dated faunas in eastern Africa indicate an age between 1 million and 600 thousand years ago. Unique features of the fauna, including the late occurrence of a dirk-toothed cat and a sivathere, may reflect its geographic origin in a region that was notable historically for its distinctive climate and high degree of biotic endemism. Together, taxonomic composition, geomorphic setting, and pollen extracted from coprolites indicate the proximity of a large marsh or pond, maintained by a higher water table. The small average size of the black-backed jackals implies relatively mild temperatures. The sum of the evidence places bone accumulation during one of the mid-Pleistocene interglacials that were longer and cooler than later ones, including the Holocene. The geomorphic context of the fauna presents no evidence for catastrophe, and most deaths probably resulted from attritional factors that disproportionately killed the young and old. However, only the dental-age profile of long-horned buffalo supports this directly. Field collection methods biased skeletal-part representation, but originally, it probably resembled the pattern in the younger, marsh-edge Acheulean occurrence at Duinefontein 2, 45 km to the south. Excavation there exposed multiple vertebral spreads, which probably mark carcasses from which hominins or large carnivores removed the meatier elements. Bone damage at both sites suggests that, despite abundant artifacts, hominins were much less important than carnivores in the bone accumulation. Together with limited observations from other sites, Elandsfontein and Duinefontein provisionally suggest that Acheulean-age hominins obtained few large mammals, whether by hunting or scavenging. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This is the largest sample of hominid temporal bones known from a single Middle Pleistocene site and it offers the chance to characterize the temporal bone morphology of an European Middle Pleistocene population and to study the phylogenetic relationships of the SH sample with other Upper and Middle Pleistocene hominids. We have carried out a cladistic analysis based on nine traits commonly used in phylogenetic analysis of Middle and Late Pleistocene hominids: shape of the temporal squama superior border, articular eminence morphology, contribution of the sphenoid bone to the median glenoid wall, postglenoid process projection, tympanic plate orientation, presence of the styloid process, mastoid process projection, digastric groove morphology and anterior mastoid tubercle. We have found two autapomorphies on the Homo erectus temporal bone: strong reduction of the postglenoid process and absence of the styloid process. Modern humans, Neandertals and the Middle Pleistocene fossils from Europe and Africa constitute a clade characterized by a convex superior border of the temporal squama. The European Middle Pleistocene fossils from Sima de los Huesos, Petralona, Steinheim, Bilzingsleben and Castel di Guido share a Neandertal apomorphy: a relatively flat articular eminence. The fossils from Ehringsdorf, La Chaise (Suard) and Biache-Saint-Vaast also display another Neandertal derived trait: an anteriorly obliterated digastric groove.

We suggest how developmental and functional criteria can be used to predict where in the skeleton of fossil hominins we should expect more, or less, within-species variation. We present and test three hypotheses about the factors contributing to craniodental variation in extant primate taxa, and then apply these results to the interpretation of the P. boisei hypodigm. Within the comparative samples of extant Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Colobus, variables from the cranial base, neurocranium, and face that are not subject to high magnitudes of strain have consistently lower levels of intraspecific variation than variables from regions of the face subject to high levels of strain. Dental size variables are intermediate in terms of their reliability. P. boisei is found to have a low degree of variability relative to extant primates for variables shown to be generally useful for testing taxonomic hypotheses. Contrary to the claims of Suwa et al. ([1997] Nature 389:489-492), the recently discovered material from Konso falls within the range of variation of the ""pre-Konso"" hypodigm of P. boisei for available conventional metrical variables. Those aspects of the Konso material that appear to extend the range of the P. boisei hypodigm involve regions of the skull predicted to be prone to high levels of within-species variation.

After the analysis of the lower second premolar and the upper first molar crown shapes, we apply the same technique to lower first premolar morphology. Our results show a clear distinction between the morphology seen in earlier hominin taxa such as Australopithecus and African early Homo, as well as Asian H. erectus, and more recent groups such as European H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens. The morphology of the earlier hominins includes an asymmetrical outline, a conspicuous talonid, and an occlusal polygon that tends to be large. The morphology of the recent hominins includes a symmetrical outline and a reduced or absent talonid. Within this later group, premolars belonging to H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis tend to possess a small and mesiolingually-displaced occlusal polygon, whereas H. sapiens specimens usually present expanded and centered occlusal polygons in an almost circular outline. The morphological differences among Paranthropus, Australopithecus, and African early Homo as studied here are small and evolutionarily less significant compared to the differences between the earlier and later homin taxa. In contrast to the lower second premolar and the upper first molar crown, the inclusion of a larger hominin sample of lower first premolars reveals a large allometric component. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously, P4 shape was assessed qualitatively, and results suggested marked differences between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans (Bailey [2002] New Anat. 269:148-156). The goal of this study was to investigate the P4 shape in more detail, quantifying it in order to determine its utility for taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analysis. A comparison of mean shapes confirms that the mesiolingual portion of the P4 is truncated in Neandertals, and that this produces a distinctively asymmetrical P4. A randomization test confirms that the shape difference between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans is significant. Principal component and discriminant function analyses indicate that the relative size of the lingual portion of the tooth also affects tooth shape, with the lingual portion of the Neandertal P4 being narrower than that of anatomically modern humans. Classification of P4 crown shapes using discriminant functions analysis is far from perfect. While 86.4% of the teeth were correctly classified, classification was much better for anatomically modern humans (98.1%) than it was for Neandertals (65%). Fortunately, crown shape is but one of several diagnostic characters of the P4 crown. P4 crown asymmetry can be added to the growing list of dental morphological characters distinguishing Neandertals from anatomically modern humans. Moreover, based on a comparison of mean tooth shapes in fossil and recent humans, symmetry, rather than asymmetry, appears to be the primitive state, and the high frequency of P4 asymmetry is likely derived in Neandertals. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Elliptic Fourier analysis; Morphometrics; Postcanine dental morphology","anatomical variation; article; controlled study; fossil; Fourier analysis; geological time; human; human tissue; mandible; neandertal; phylogeny; physical anthropology; species comparison; species difference; taxonomy; tooth crown; tooth size; Animals; Discriminant Analysis; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Mandible; Molar; Paleodontology; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Tooth Crown",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-13544271764

Our ongoing studies indicate that the Neanderthals differ from modern humans in their skeletal anatomy in more ways than have been recognized up to now. The purpose of this contribution is to describe specializations of the Neanderthal internal nasal region that make them unique not only among hominids but possibly among terrestrial mammals in general as well.

To assess the validity of calling certain fossils Neandertal-like, a definition of Neandertals themselves must first be established. Previous definitions are unaccepttable because they do not isolate those characters which differentiate Neandertals from other groups of the genus Homo. By looking for between-group differences and within-group similarities a set of calvarial features was found which characterizes both European and Levant Neandertals, and isolates them from other hominid groups. Though they are few, these features are the derived, phylogenetically important characters and are far more important than the primitive, shared traits previous workers focused on. Of ten presumed Neandertal-like skulls compared to the definition based on the derived characters, only Swanscombe and Steinheim showed any of the diagnostic Neandertal features. The fossils most often touted as Neandertal-like, Broken Hill and the Ngandong group, do not have a single diagnostic Neandertal feature. Any similarity rests solely on primitive, shared characters. These results argue strongly against the existence of a world-wide Neandertal grade or stage of human evolution. This study leads to several other inferences which must be verified by further work. For example, the lack of similarity between Skhul, Omo, Jebel Ighoud and Jebel Qafza on the one hand and Neandertals on the other certainly does not support a Neandertal derivation of modern H. sapiens. © 1978 Academic Press Inc.

The mandible, as a morphological complex, comprises a large number of derived Neanderthal features. The present study investigates whether the features usually considered as European lineage apomorphies evolved independently; the occurrence of these features is studied in the mandibles from the Sima de los Huesos (SH) site (Atapuerca, Spain). For comparative purposes, a large sample of Neanderthal mandibles as well as older fossil Homo specimens have been used for the study. Chi-square tests were employed to test for independence. The SH mandibles present a set of features that clearly show the basic architecture of the Neanderthal mandible. A highly significant association is detected in the variation of the position of the mental foramen, the lateral prominence, and the anterior marginal tubercle, as well as in the development of retromolar space. However, a much weaker association is detected in the features of the internal aspect of the mandible, with a few exceptions. Features of the external aspect of the mandible occur chronologically earlier than those observed in the internal aspect. The hypothesis that two distinct and consecutive morphological processes have driven the emergence of the European lineage throughout the Middle Pleistocene is proposed. A first transformation affects the mandible by means of backwards displacement of the structures located at the external aspect, as well as the position of the condyle. A second process would modify the features of the internal aspect of the mandible, in which the relief of the masseteric and pterygoid fossae are affected, in association with a spatial rearrangement of the corpus and ramus. Analyzed individually, some of the considered features may be questioned as Neanderthal apomorphies (Trinkaus,1993; Franciscus and Trinkaus, 995); however, the joint occurrence of many of them suggests that the complex is an evolutionary novelty. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Apomorphy; Atapuerca; Mandible; Variability","article; evolution; fossil; mandible; masseter muscle; masticatory muscle; morphology; physical anthropology; Spain; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Evolution; Female; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Male; Mandible; Spain",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035167418

This study developed two models of morphological variation to be applied to a comparison between Neanderthals and modern humans: modern human populations provided a measure of intra-specific variation, while the species and subspecies of Pan provided measures of both intra- and inter-specific morphological differences. Although such an approach has been advocated strongly, it has not been systematically undertaken until recently. The techniques of geometric morphometrics were used to collect data in the form of three-dimensional coordinates of craniofacial landmarks. The data were processed using generalized procrustes analysis, and analyzed by an array of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components analysis, canonical variates analysis and Mahalanobis D2. The morphological distances between Neanderthals and modern humans, and between Neanderthals and Late Paleolithic/early anatomically modern specimens, are consistently greater than the distances among recent human populations, and greater than the distances between the two chimpanzee species. Furthermore, no strong morphological similarities were found between Neanderthals and Late Paleolithic Europeans.

This study applied the techniques of geometric morphometrics to the complex morphology of the temporal bone, in order to quantify the differences observed between Neanderthal and modern human anatomy. Two hundred and seventy modern human crania were measured, representing 9 populations of 30 individuals each, and spanning the extremes of the modern human geographical range. Twelve Neanderthal specimens, as well as Reilingen, Kabwe, Skhul 5, Qafzeh 9, and 4 Late Paleolithic European specimens, were included in the fossil sample.

The fitted coordinates were then analyzed by an array of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components analysis, canonical variates analysis, and Mahalanobis D2. The temporal bone landmark analysis was very successful in separating Neanderthals from modern humans. Neanderthals were separated from modern humans in both the principal components and canonical variates analyses. They were much further in Mahalanobis distances from all modern human populations than any two modern human groups were from each other.

Such early Middle Pleistocene hominins were not anatomically modern. Their skulls display strong supraorbital tori above projecting faces, flattened frontals, and less parietal expansion than is the case for Homo sapiens. Postcranial remains seem also to have archaic features. Subsequently, some groups evolved advanced skeletal morphology, and by ca. 200,000 years ago, individuals more similar to recent humans are present in the African record. These fossils are associated with Middle Stone Age lithic assemblages and, in some cases, Acheulean tools. Crania from Herto in Ethiopia carry defleshing cutmarks and superficial scoring that may be indicative of mortuary practices. Despite these signs of behavioral innovation, neither the Herto hominins, nor others from Late Pleistocene sites such as Klasies River in southern Africa and Skhūl/Qafzeh in Israel, can be matched in living populations. Skulls are quite robust, and it is only after ≈35,000 years ago that people with more gracile, fully modern morphology make their appearance. Not surprisingly, many questions concerning this evolutionary history have been raised. Attention has centered on systematics of the mid-Pleistocene hominins, their paleobiology, and the timing of dispersals that spread H. sapiens out of Africa and across the Old World. In this report, I discuss structural changes characterizing the skulls from different time periods, possible regional differences in morphology, and the bearing of this evidence on recognizing distinct species.","Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Human evolution; Skull morphology; Systematics","Africa; anatomical variation; bone structure; brain size; evolution; fossil hominid; hominid; Homo heidelbergensis; homo sapiens; human; Middle Pleistocene; Pleistocene; posthumous care; priority journal; review; skeleton; skull base; South Asia; Upper Pleistocene; animal; article; Asia; bone; brain; classification; face; fossil; histology; methodology; physical anthropology; population dynamics; skull; time; Crania; Homo erectus; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo sapiens; Africa; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Asia; Bone and Bones; Brain; Evolution; Face; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Population Dynamics; Skull; Time Factors",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349519050

In the past 15 years there has been a renewed interested in Neandertal dental morphology, especially with regard to how they compare to recent and fossil modern humans. However, no complete description of Neandertal dental morphology has been published since the mid-1950s. Many more Neandertals and other fossil hominins have been discovered since then and are available for a comparative study. This paper provides a description of Neandertal dental morphology and places that morphology in a comparative fossil hominin context. It differs from previous work by focusing on fossil hominin variation (as opposed to contemporary modern human variation) and provides a comparative baseline in which Neandertal dental morphology can be assessed. The four comparative samples include European and West Asian Neandertals, European non-Neandertal archaics, South African/West Asian early modern humans and European early modern humans (e.g., Upper Paleolithic). A mean measure of divergence analysis shows that Neandertals are significantly different from early modern human groups, being four times more divergent from Afro-Asian and European early modern human samples than the early modern human samples are from each other. Moreover, Neandertals are more divergent from early modern Europeans than they are from the early modern Afro-Asians. Contrary to the results of a previous study they are significantly divergent from non-Neandertal archaics. The implications for these results are discussed.","Africa; Europe; Fossil hominins; H. heidelbergeneis; H. sapiens; Introduction; Multivariate analysis; Teeth; West Asia","article; canine tooth; comparative study; dentition; evolution; fossil; human; incisor; molar tooth; morphology; multivariate analysis; premolar tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746487882

The result was a very large spread of dates particularly on bone samples. Amid the large spread of results, some radiometric data on speleothems showed a convergence in agreement with inferences from faunal studies. We present new U-series results on the stalagmitic formation located at the bottom of Unit IV (at the base of the Upper Stratigraphic Complex). Samples and splits were collaboratively analyzed in the four different laboratories with excellent interlaboratory agreement. Results show the complex sequence of this stalagmitic formation.

This evidence is critical for evaluating the competing models regarding diversity within our genus. The debate focuses on two alternative hypotheses, one basically anagenetic and the other cladogenetic. The first suggests that morphological change is so diffused, slow, and steady that it is meaningless to apply species names to segments of a single lineage. The second is that the morphological variation observed in the fossil record can best be described as a number of distinct species that are not connected in a linear ancestor-descendant sequence. Today much more fossil evidence is available than was in the past to test these alternative hypotheses, as well as intermediate variants. Special attention must be paid to Africa because this is the most probable continental homeland for both the origin of the genus Homo (around 2.5-2 Ma), 1 as well as the site, two million or so years later, of the emergence of the species H. sapiens. 2 However, the African fossil record is very poorly represented between 1 Ma and 600 ka. Europe furnishes recent discoveries in this time range around the Matuyama-Brunhes chron boundary (780,000 years ago), a period for which, at present, we have no noteworthy fossil evidence in Africa or the Levant. Two penecontemporaneous sources of European fossil evidence, the Ceprano calvaria (Italy) 3 and the TD6 fossil assemblage of Atapuerca (Spain)) 6 are thus of great interest for testing hypotheses about human evolution in the fundamental time span bracketed between the late Early and the Middle Pleistocene. This paper is based on a phenetic approach to cranial variation aimed at reviewing the Early-to-Middle Pleistocene trajectories of human evolution. The focus of the paper is on neither the origin nor the end of the story of the genus Homo, but rather its chronological and phylogenetic core. Elucidation of the evolutionary events that happened around 780 ka during the transition from the Early to Middle Pleistocene is one of the new frontiers for human paleontology, and is critical for understanding the processes that ultimately led to the origin of H. sapiens.","Ceprano; Cranial morphology; Early/Middle Pleistocene; Evolutionary scenarios; Genus Homo","Hominidae; Homo; Homo sapiens",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-2042508972

It is argued that the primitive appearance of the Mauer mandible occurs along with unequivocal indications of Neandertal apomorphies. The BL dimensions of the incisors and morphology of premolars as well as the variables related to the position of the mental foramen and retromolar space definitely indicate that Mauer should be classified as a member of the evolutionary lineage which evolved into classic Neandertals. We conclude that the Mauer mandible represents a population forming part of the Neandertals evolutionary lineage. Therefore, the name H. heidelbergensis cannot be used to denote the last common ancestor to Neandertals and Modern humans.

The middle cranial fossa (MCF) interacts during growth and development with the temporal lobes, the midface, and the mandible. It has been proposed that evolutionary transformations of the MCF (perhaps from modification of the temporal lobes) can have substantial influences on craniofacial morphology. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics and computer reconstructions of computed tomography-scanned fossil hominids, fossil and recent modern humans and chimpanzees to address this issue further. Mean comparisons and permutation analyses of scaled 3D basicranial landmarks confirm that the MCF of Homo sapiens is highly significantly different (P < 0.001) from H. neanderthalensis, H. heidelbergensis, and Pan troglodytes. Modern humans have a unique configuration with relatively more anterolateral projection of the MCF pole relative to the optic chiasm and the foramen rotundum. These findings are discussed in the context of evolutionary changes in craniofacial morphology and the origins of modern human autapomorphies. In particular, the findings of this study point to variations in the temporal lobe, which, through effects on tbe MCF and face, are central to the evolution of modern human facial form. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","3D reconstructions; Geometric morphometrics; Human evolution; Lateral cranial base; Sphenoid; Temporal lobes","animal; anthropometry; article; comparative study; evolution; fossil; histology; human; middle cranial fossa; Pan troglodytes; Animals; Anthropometry; Cranial Fossa, Middle; Evolution; Fossils; Humans; Pan troglodytes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41949133442

Evidence for such admixture must be sought in the earliest fossil record of modern humans outside Africa, as it is those populations that would have encountered, and possibly interbred with, archaic hominins. In the case of Europe, the recent application of direct dating techniques has eliminated several specimens from the Upper Paleolithic fossil record, while confirming early ages for others. Among these earliest reliably dated specimens is the Cioclovina calvaria from Romania. This individual is of highest importance for the understanding of modern human origins in Europe, and has recently been proposed to represent a Neanderthal-modern human hybrid. We present a short description and a three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometric analysis of the Cioclovina specimen using a large geographic sample of recent humans, Neanderthals and Middle and Late Pleistocene fossil hominins from Europe, Africa, and the Levant, in order to establish its phenetic affinities and to evaluate its morphology for evidence of admixture between Neanderthals and early modern Europeans.

However, the posterior and lateral cranial dimensions, and most of its anatomy, are centered among modern humans and resemble specimens from Omo, Skhul, and Qafzeh. As a result, the Aduma and Bouri Upper Pleistocene hominids are assigned to anatomically modern Homo sapiens. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Aduma; Cranium; Homo sapiens; Middle Awash; Pleistocene","anatomy; archeology; article; cultural anthropology; Ethiopia; fossil; geographic distribution; hominid; human; occipital bone; skull; Animals; Ethiopia; Evolution; Fossils; Geography; Hominidae; Humans; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0348050050

However, it has been suggested that different cranial regions preserve phylogenetic information differentially. Some parts of the face and neurocranium are thought to be relatively developmentally flexible, and therefore to be subject to the epigenetic influence of the environment. Other parts are thought to be particularly responsive to selection for adaptation to local climate. The basicranium, on the other hand, and in particular the temporal bone, is thought to be largely genetically determined and has been argued to preserve a strong phylogenetic signal with little possibility of homoplasy. Here we test the hypotheses that cranial morphology is related to population history among recent humans, and that different cranial regions reflect population history and local climate differentially. Morphological distances among ten recent human populations were calculated from the face, vault and temporal bone using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics methods. The distance matrices obtained were then compared to neutral genetic distances and to climatic differences among the same or closely matched groups. Results indicated a stronger relationship of the shape of the vault and the temporal bone with neutral genetic distances, and a stronger association of facial shape with climate. Vault and temporal bone centroid sizes were associated with climate and particularly temperature; facial centroid size was associated with genetic distances. Temporal bone shape was more successful in tracking older population history than vault shape. Of the three cranial regions, it is therefore most appropriate for phylogenetic reconstructions among fossil humans. Analysis of temporal bone shape of both recent and Middle-Late Pleistocene humans showed Neanderthals to be morphologically very distant from both recent and fossil modern humans, indicating that Neanderthals represent a distinct evolutionary lineage. © 2008 Springer.","Climate; Craniofacial morphology; Genetics; Neanderthals; Phylogeny; Population history",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937991635

This method seemed relatively straightforward and precise especially as new discoveries were fitted into the schemes, apparently strengthening the correlations and increasing their validity. However, recent studies of deep‐sea cores and terrestrial deposits, combined with new developments in relative and absolute dating, have shown that the fourfold schemes are oversimplified. This paper critically reviews some of the dating evidence from sites with hominid remains generally considered as Middle Pleistocene (ca. 700,000–128,000 BP). The hominid and archaeological remains are shown to require independent dating and a cautious approach is adopted towards the use of mammalian faunal remains as chronological indicators. The techniques and results of absolute dating are discussed with reference to present problems and future prospects. At a time of transition from an old framework to new correlations, it is inevitable that some conclusions seem tentative and others rather negative. Nevertheless, the Middle Pleistocene in Europe is more fully understood and better dated than the equivalent period in other parts of the world.

Ciencias, Campus Universitario, 28871 Alcalá de Henares, Spain","In this article, the upper cervical spine remains recovered from the Sima de los Huesos (SH) middle Pleistocene site in the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos, Spain) are described and analyzed. To date, this site has yielded more than 5000 human fossils belonging to a minimum of 28 individuals of the species Homo heidelbergensis. At least eleven individuals are represented by the upper cervical (C1 and C2) specimens: six adults and five subadults, one of which could represent an adolescent individual. The most complete adult vertebrae (three atlases and three axes) are described, measured, and compared with other fossil hominins and modern humans. These six specimens are associated with one another and represent three individuals. In addition, one of these sets of cervical vertebrae is associated with Cranium 5 (Individual XXI) from the site. The metric analysis demonstrates that the Sima de los Huesos atlases and axes are metrically more similar to Neandertals than to our modern human comparative sample. The SH atlases share with Neandertals a sagittally elongated canal. The most remarkable feature of the SH (and Neandertal) axes is that they are craniocaudally low and mediolaterally wide compared to our modern male sample. Morphologically, the SH sample shares with Neandertals a higher frequency of caudally projected anterior atlas arch, which could reflect greater development of the longus colli muscle. In other features, such as the frequency of weakly developed tubercles for the attachment of the transverse ligament of the atlas, the Sima de los Huesos fossils show intermediate frequencies between our modern comparative samples and the Neandertals, which could represent the primitive condition. Our results are consistent with the previous phylogenetic interpretation of H. heidelbergensis as an exclusively European species, ancestral only to H. neanderthalensis. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is no doubt whatsoever that Homo neanderthalensis is as clear-cut a morphological entity as any in the hominid fossil record: one that is characterized by a whole host of cranial apomorphies. Further, a recent full-skeleton reconstruction further emphasizes just how different Neanderthal body structure was from that of Homo sapiens, not simply in numerous anatomical details, but in the proportions of the thorax and its relation to the pelvic region. These bodily proportions would have given these extinct hominids a very distinctive appearance on the landscape, and enhance the likelihood that we are dealing here with a reproductively differentiated entity. Still, Homo neanderthalensis is not unique in all those features that distinguish it from Homo sapiens. Many “Neanderthal” cranial features are shared with various middle Pleistocene European hominids, notably the Steinheim specimen and, to a lesser extent, the Sima de los Huesos hominids from Atapuerca. Indeed, it appears that, far from being an isolated phenomenon, Homo neanderthalensis formed part of a larger endemic European hominid clade. This clade seems to have existed contemporaneously in Europe with at least one other hominid lineage or clade, exemplified by the Homo heidelbergensis fossils from Mauer, Arago and Petralona. © 2008 Springer.","Arago; Atapuerca; Homo heidelbergensis; Homo neanderthalensis; Mauer; Neanderthals; Reconstructed skeleton; Sima de los Huesos",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045097349

Comparisons between single specimens using the thin-plate-spline function suggest a generalized reduction of the lower face, associated with antero-posterior development of the braincase occurring (possibly in parallel evolution) along distinct human lineages. Furthermore, Neandertals display a projection of the midface, and modern humans show a derived globularity of the vault associated with midsagittal parietal bulging. Principal Component Analysis demonstrates a bimodal pattern of variation, which describes an »archaic« pole (rather heterogeneous in terms of taxonomy) clearly distinguishable from the modern one. The first two principal components - that explain together 80% of the total variance in shape - involve respectively fronto-parietal expansion and midfacial prognathism. These results contribute to identify different structural patterns in human evolution, supporting discontinuity rather than continuity of cranial shape among different taxa of the genus Homo, especially when considering the differences between Neandertals and early modern humans.","Cranial shape; Genus Homo; Geometric morphometry","anatomical variation; anterior posterior axis; article; comparative anatomy; comparative study; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; evolution; face; geometry; human; human tissue; morphometrics; principal component analysis; prognathia; skull; skull development; taxonomy; variance; Animals; Cephalometry; Craniology; Evolution; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Models, Biological; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3142547336

The inclusion of distinct infraorbital configurations, such as the ""canine fossa"" in Homo sapiens or the ""inflated"" maxilla in Neandertals, is generally based on either descriptive or qualitative assessments of this morphology, or simple linear chord and subtense measurements. However, the complex curvilinear surface of the infraorbital region has proven difficult to quantify through these traditional methods. In this study, we assess infraorbital shape and its potential allometric scaling in fossil Homo (n = 18) and recent humans (n = 110) with a geometric morphometric method well-suited for quantifying complex surface topographies. Our results indicate that important aspects of infraorbital shape are correlated with overall infraorbital size across Homo. Specifically, individuals with larger infraorbital areas tend to exhibit relatively flatter infraorbital surface topographies, taller and narrower infraorbital areas, sloped inferior orbital rims, anteroinferiorly oriented maxillary body facies, posteroinferiorly oriented maxillary processes of the zygomatic, and non-everted lateral nasal margins. In contrast, individuals with smaller infraorbital regions generally exhibit relatively depressed surface topographies, shorter and wider infraorbital areas, projecting inferior orbital rims, posteroinferiorly oriented maxillary body facies, anteroinferiorly oriented maxillary processes, and everted lateral nasal margins. These contrasts form a continuum and only appear dichotomized at the ends of the infraorbital size spectrum. In light of these results, we question the utility of incorporating traditionally polarized infraorbital morphologies in phylogenetic and functional analyses without due consideration of continuous infraorbital and facial size variation in Homo. We conclude that the essentially flat infraorbital surface topography of Neandertals is not unique and can be explained, in part, as a function of possessing large infraorbital regions, the ancestral condition for Homo. Furthermore, it appears likely that the diminutive infraorbital region of anatomically modern Homo sapiens is a primary derived trait, with related features such as depressed infraorbital surface topography expressed as correlated secondary characters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Layer B1/6-7, from which the Amud I Neanderthal skeleton was recovered, is dated to 53 ± 8 ka. Layer B2/8, which yielded other important human remains including the Amud 7 skeleton, gives a mean burial age of 61 ± 9 ka. One tooth from the lowest layer (B4) yielded a date of 70 ± 11 ka, but another tooth from this layer gave an 113 ± 18 ka. Despite this discrepancy, these ages agree with previously published TL ages on heated flints for the corresponding layers.

In particular, the degree to which the three adult crania exhibit recent East Asian morphology, as well as their degree of within-group variability, has long been debated. Several early researchers described a resemblance to East Asian populations, but these findings have been for the most part rejected by more recent metric and non-metric analyses. Nevertheless, the Upper Cave specimens have not been classified conclusively into any recent modern human population to which they have been compared, and classification results differ for each cranium. Here, the question of the affinities of Upper Cave 101 and 103, the two better-preserved crania, is examined from the perspective of the Late Pleistocene human fossil record using the methodology of 3-D geometric morphometrics. The degree of morphological variation between the two specimens is also evaluated within the context of recent population variability. Neurocranial and facial morphology are analyzed separately so as to maximize comparative samples. Results show a morphological resemblance of the Upper Cave material to Upper Paleolithic Europeans. It is proposed that the Upper Cave specimens retain important aspects of modern human ancestral morphology, and possibly share a recent common ancestral population with Upper Paleolithic Europeans, in accordance with the Single Origin model of modern human origins. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Paleontological evidence suggests that recent humans originated and expanded from an African lineage that may have undergone demographic crises in the Late Pleistocene according to archaeological and genetic data. This would suggest that extant human populations derive from, and perhaps sample a restricted part of the genetic and morphological variation that was present in the Late Pleistocene. Crania that date to Marine Isotope Stage 3 should yield information pertaining to the level of Late Pleistocene human phenotypic diversity and its evolution in modern humans. The Nazlet Khater (NK) and Hofmeyr (HOF) crania from Egypt and South Africa, together with penecontemporaneous specimens from the Peştera cu Oase in Romania, permit preliminary assessment of variation among modern humans from geographically disparate regions at this time. Morphometric and morphological comparisons with other Late Pleistocene modern human specimens, and with 23 recent human population samples, reveal that elevated levels of variation are present throughout the Late Pleistocene. Comparison of Holocene and Late Pleistocene craniometric variation through resampling analyses supports hypotheses derived from genetic data suggesting that present phenotypic variation may represent only a restricted part of Late Pleistocene human diversity. The Nazlet Khater, Hofmeyr, and Oase specimens provide a unique glimpse of that diversity. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Africa; Craniometric data; Eurasia; Modern human origins","Africa; article; genetic variability; Holocene; human; morphometrics; paleontology; phenotypic variation; Pleistocene; skull development; Crania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349117009

Several basic questions about the biological processes determining the apomorphic morphology of this human group are still pending resolution. In this paper we present a general outline of the lines of research we are currently following in the exploration of Neanderthal anatomy. We focus our approach on three different aspects: (1) a methodological and theoretical component based on system theory; (2) specific morphological problems, such as the effects of body size and brain development on craniofacial shape in Neanderthals; and (3) the analysis of these aspects by geometric morphometric and paleohistological methods. Presently, Neanderthals are considered the end point of an evolutionary lineage rooted in the European Middle Pleistocene fossil record. The ""tempo and mode"" in the evolution of the Neanderthal lineage are here evaluated by comparison of two different perspectives: the ""accretion model"" (Hublin, 1998a) and the ""organismic model"". In the former, stochastic processes are invoked to account for the ""gradual tempo and a mosaic mode"" for the emergence of the Neanderthal anatomy. By contrast, the ""organismic model"" presented here, sets out the hypothesis that the Neanderthal skull form may result from two interconnected effects at different levels of organization: (1) body-face interactions via organismic-level effects (e.g., allometry, physiological demands), and (2) brain-face interactions via integration principles. We propose a conceptual framework in which the evolutionary process experienced by the Neanderthal lineage was primarily dominated by two distinct and successive phases. The first to appear in time was that producing midfacial prognathism, which may be related to mid-sagittal growth dynamics, in which body size and cranial base orientation are primarily involved. This evolutionary phase is accompanied by significant variation, which is still poorly understood. Here it is associated with increased body size and sexual dimorphism variation, and its concomitant craniofacial compensatory mechanisms. A second evo-devo process, largely related to the relative size increase of the occipital and temporal neural areas, affects the organization of the skull, via cascading effects resulting from integration mechanisms (at times assimilated to pleiotropic effects). In this two-phase evolutionary process, facial changes may be connected with processes affecting the variation of the sagittal cranial base, whereas temporal bone modification may be related to processes affecting bilateral, middle cranial fossa variation. Occipital modifications remain open to interpretation, although a complex interplay between increased encephalization and head position (perhaps as an indirect result of body shape) might be considered. Taxonomically, the ""accretion model"" considers the Neanderthal lineage as a continuum of evolving populations, which are temporally associated with two different nomina: H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis, on the basis of a single chronospecies concept. In an alternative view, we favor the hypothesis that the species H. neanderthalensis emerges as a distinct biological entity (morph) after a speciation event (or change in morphological quality). The main point of this paper is to evaluate the ""accretion model"" versus a two-phase hypothesis of Neanderthal speciation in the Middle Paleolithic. © 2008 Springer.","Accretion model; Bone remodeling; Craniofacial; Geometric morphometrics; Neanderthal; Organismic model",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045126478

The technique is discussed in some detail, and is illustrated by applying it to the problem of characterizing Neanderthal cranial shape. The method of thin-plate splines uses a mathematical model based on the bending of a hypothetical steel plate in order 1) objectively to generate a D'Arcy Thompson-style deformed grid that illustrates the shape contrast between two forms, and 2) to quantify the shape difference by breaking it down into a series of components based on scale. Results confirm the presence of some features traditionally attributed to Neanderthals, but some ""classic"" Neanderthal features do not in fact characterize the Neanderthal sample. Traits may have been misidentified because of failure to take into account differences in absolute size, use of a misleading frame of reference, and interpretation of one aspect of a large-scale change as a localized feature. In particular, the important Neanderthal ""specialization"" midfacial prognathism, defined as forward displacement of the nasal region and the tooth row relative to more lateral facial structures, does not appear to be a typical Neanderthal trait. The uniqueness of Neanderthals appears to have been exaggerated, and may be related to Boule's peculiar, flawed reconstruction of the skull of La Chapelle-aux-Saints. The method of thinplate splines is a powerful technique, capable of providing a new and insightful perspective on morphological problems in physical anthropology. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cranial shape; Morphometrics; Neanderthals; Partial warp analysis; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-24944450797

The skull from Hofmeyr, South Africa, which has been dated to c. 36. ka, is one of the only specimens known from this critical part of the late Pleistocene. The Hofmeyr skull was largely intact at the time of its discovery but has suffered post-recovery mishandling, with the resultant loss of most of the lower facial skeleton, the mandibular angle, the right mastoid process, and much of the occipital. Given the potential significance of this specimen, we have undertaken its restoration and reconstruction so as to provide a more complete picture of the cranial morphology of the late Pleistocene population from which it derived. On the basis of photographs, measurements, and morphological description recorded prior to its having been damaged, we reconstructed some of the missing bone in modeling clay on a high resolution plastic cast of the cranium. The original specimen was CT scanned, as was the cast with the reconstructed maxilla and mastoid; these scans were employed in the final computer reconstruction of the skull. Virtual reconstruction of the remainder of the cranium was accomplished using mirror-imaging and reference-based methods, employing 3D geometric morphometrics from a sample of recent human crania to compute coordinate-based estimates of the missing parts. This reconstruction provides a more complete picture of the Hofmeyr cranium and serves as a basis for more comprehensive morphometric comparisons. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Clay modeling; Cranial capacity; Craniometry; Cranium; CT scan; Geometric morphometrics; Mandible; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline; Virtual reconstruction","hominid; human evolution; morphology; paleontology; Pleistocene; reconstruction; skeletal remains; skull; three-dimensional modeling; Eastern Cape; Hofmeyr; South Africa; Crania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954214835

The sample is represented by three specimens, SD-1219, SD-1149, and SD-370a. Descriptive morphology, linear measurements, 3D geometric morphometrics, and virtual anthropological methods were employed to address the morphological, morphometric, and phylogenetic affinities of these fossils. The fossils display Neandertal autapomorphies (e.g., bilaterally protruding transverse occipital torus, suprainiac fossa). SD-1219 also preserves a strongly projecting juxtamastoid eminence and shows occipital bunning. In linear distances, the El Sidrón occipitals are similar to each other and close to the Neandertal mean. The centroid size of SD-1219 is slightly larger than the Neandertal average. All of the evidence taken together points to the hypothesis that SD-1219 belongs to a smaller Neandertal male. Linear measurements and the vault thickness of SD-1149 also suggest a robust male individual. The gracility of SD-370a points towards an immature individual. Virtual anthropological methods were used to reconstruct a 3D model of the SD-1219 occipital for geometric morphometrics, which reveals that SD-1219 shows relatively broad and low occipital plane proportions. Within the European Pleistocene lineage sample, this fossil falls geometrically closer to primitive rather than to derived morphologies because of its increased width, and a lower, anterior position of inion relative to the biasterionic axis. These results may imply that cranial sphericity could be an important feature of intraspecific Neandertal variability. Our findings open the way for further studies of intraspecific variation in Neandertal populations, in which the El Sidrón sample may play a significant role. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A morphological reassessment of its supraorbital region and a morphometric analysis of its overall proportions indicate that it falls well within expected ranges of variation of Late Pleistocene Neandertals and is separate from European earlier Upper Paleolithic early modern human crania. It is similar to the Qafzeh-Skhul sample in some metrical and supraorbital robusticity measures, but it contrasts with them in mid-sagittal curvature and supraorbital torus morphology. In the context of its probable oxygen isotope stage 5 age based on inferred biostratigraphic associations, it should not be employed directly for arguments relating to the emergence of modern humans in Central Europe. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Fossils supporting the assumption of a more continuous transitional phase have been missing hitherto. Particularly interesting in this context is a new fossil frontal bone which was found in 1973 in glacial sands of the Elbe river at Hahnöfer-sand near Hamburg. It was absolutely dated to ca 36,000 years B.P. The fossil was extensively studied and compared with a large number of Neanderthals, Upper Paleolithic hominids and with some of the intermediate hominids from Palestine as Skhūl and Qafzeh. Principal component analysis as well as multivariate distance measurements show strong affinities between Hahnöfersand and Neanderthals such as La Ferrassie and Amud I. In contrast to the Neanderthaloid frontal profile, the morphology of the supraorbital region of Hahnöfersand mainly shows modern features. There is no continuous torus; the very robust glabella and superciliary arches are well defined. Altogether Hahnöfersand provides us perhaps with the first concrete indication of a hybridization phase between both groups in Western Europe. © 1981 Academic Press Inc.
