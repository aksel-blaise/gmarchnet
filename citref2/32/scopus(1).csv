Among documented groups, a common response to such stress is temporary movement into adjacent occupied areas-moving in with ""relatives"" when things go wrong. However, in the case of early (ca. 12,000-10,000 B.P.) Paleoindian groups in the Americas, the availability of neighboring groups with a detailed knowledge of local resource geography could not be relied upon. Post-Pleistocene environmental changes and the low initial population of the New World are important factors conditioning a lifeway characterized by a dependence on hunting (though not exclusively of megafauna), and by high residential, logistical, and range (territorial) mobility. Early Paleoindian groups had to adopt a subsistence technology that could be employed regardless of the specific resource microstructure. In some regards, Paleoindians seem to have behaved like tropical foragers while in others like arctic collectors. Use of high quality lithic raw materials from large quarry sources, reliance on a bifacial technology, limited use of caves and rockshelters, and a low level of processing of food products for storage all may be indicative of such a subsistence technology, which would have been unlike that of any modern hunter-gatherers. © 1988 Society for American Archaeology.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019768854

These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

Just when and how they did so has been one of the most perplexing and controversial questions in archaeology. This dazzling, cutting-edge synthesis, written for a wide audience by an archaeologist who has long been at the center of these debates, tells the scientific story of the first Americans: where they came from, when they arrived, and how they met the challenges of moving across the vast, unknown landscapes of Ice Age North America. David J. Meltzer pulls together the latest ideas from archaeology, geology, linguistics, skeletal biology, genetics, and other fields to trace the breakthroughs that have revolutionized our understanding in recent years. Among many other topics, he explores disputes over the hemisphere's oldest and most controversial sites and considers how the first Americans coped with changing global climates. He also confronts some radical claims: that the Americas were colonized from Europe or that a crashing comet obliterated the Pleistocene megafauna. Full of entertaining descriptions of on-site encounters, personalities, and controversies, this is a compelling behind-the-scenes account of how science is illuminating our past. © 2009 by the Regents of the University of California.",,,Book,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887856379

Modules are integrated internally by many interactions among their component parts, but are linked to one another only by few or weak interactions. Accordingly, traits within modules are tightly correlated with each other, but relatively independent of traits in other modules. Hypotheses concerning the boundaries of modules in a landmark configuration can therefore be tested by comparing the strength of covariation among alternative partitions of the configuration into subsets of landmarks. If a subdivision coincides with the true boundaries between modules, the correlations among subsets should be minimal. This article introduces Escoufier's RV coefficient and the multi-set RV coefficient as measures of the correlation between two or more subsets of landmarks. These measures can be compared between alternative partitions of the configuration into subsets. Because developmental interactions are tissue bound, it is sensible to require that modules should be spatially contiguous. I propose a criterion for spatial contiguity for sets of landmarks using an adjacency graph.

Their association with both Neanderthals and early modern humans has, in particular, fuelled such debate. Yet, controversy exists regarding the extent of 'predetermination' and 'standardization' in so-called 'preferential Levallois flakes' (PLFs). Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an experimental and morphometric approach, we assess the degree of standardization in PLFs compared to the flakes produced during their manufacture. PLFs possess specific properties that unite them robustly as a group or 'category' of flake. The properties that do so, relate most strongly to relative flake thicknesses across their surface area. PLFs also exhibit significantly less variability than the flakes generated during their production. Again, this is most evident in flake thickness variables. A further aim of our study was to assess whether the particular PLF attributes identified during our analyses can be related to current knowledge regarding flake functionality and utility. Conclusions/Significance: PLFs are standardized in such a manner that they may be considered 'predetermined' with regard to a specific set of properties that distinguishes them statistically from a majority of other flakes. Moreover, their attributes can be linked to factors that, based on current knowledge, are desirable features in flake tools (e.g. durability, capacity for retouch, and reduction of torque). As such, our results support the hypothesis that the lengthy, multi-phase, and hierarchically organized process of Levallois reduction was a deliberate, engineered strategy orientated toward specific goals. In turn, our results support suggestions that Levallois knapping relied on a cognitive capacity for long-term working memory. This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that cognitive distinctions between later Pleistocene hominins such as the Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans were not as sharp as some scholars have previously suggested. © 2012 Eren, Lycett.",,"article; controlled study; fossil hominin; materials testing; morphometrics; paleoanthropology; standardization; structure analysis; animal; archeology; biological model; classification; comparative study; histology; history; hominid; Homo neanderthalensis; human; instrumentation; kitchen; laboratory diagnosis; methodology; morphometrics; physiology; standard; tool use; validation study; weapon; Animals; Archaeology; Body Weights and Measures; Cooking and Eating Utensils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Biological; Neanderthals; Specimen Handling; Tool Use Behavior; Validation Studies as Topic; Weapons",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856112566

While several attributes usually help define a "" type,"" shape is invariably the most important. Here I report on a study that uses landmark-based geometric morphometrics to better define three Paleoindian point types from Florida: Suwannees, Simpsons, and Transitional Side Notched. Bilaterally symmetric specimens were created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating the types. The results show that the base configurations were best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife allocation tests. The entire point shape was less robust due to the variability in blade shape. The study demonstrates that the three point types can be rigorously defined in ways that are usable in daily archaeological practice, and that base shape, rather than the entire shape, is a better discriminator. Further, the study demonstrates the utility of using several freeware programs for processing and analyzing shape data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Geometric morphometrics; Hafting; Landmarks; Paleoindian; Symmetry; Typology","archaeology; artifact; geometry; morphometry; symmetry; typology; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857117297

Here, we report an attempt to resolve this argument using a large sample of Clovis points from dated assemblages and a suite of shape analysis methods known as geometric morphometrics. The study tested the two main hypotheses that have been put forward in the debate: the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis, which holds that Clovis points do not vary regionally, and the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis, which holds that there is regional variation as a consequence of Clovis groups adjusting their food-getting toolkits to local conditions. We used discriminant function analysis and a multivariate extension of the t test to assess whether differences in shape exist at two scales. The first set of analyses compared points from the most obvious environmental regions in North America, the East and the West. The second set of analyses investigated differences among points from subregions within the East and West. The analyses revealed significant differences between points from the East and the West and among points from some subregions. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these differences are not the result of the most common confounding factors, raw material quality and resharpening. As such, the analyses support the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis rather than the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis. We conclude from this that Clovis people modified their points to suit the characteristics of local prey and/or the habitats in which they hunted. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Clovis points; Continent-wide adaptation; Geometric morphometrics; Regional environmental adaptation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898651207

The symmetrical, bifluted form allowed a split, facial-contact haft to extend nearly to the tip, thereby controlling both location and extent of fracture and allowing many cycles of point reworking. Extreme thinnes achieved by fluting facilitated leading edge sharpness for enhanced penetration. The near-constant cross-section from tip to base meant no loss of leading edge acuteness upon resharpening and inter-changeability of broken segments. The high-friction, forwardly adjustable haft assured firm mounting even with shortened, reused point segments. This efficient design was critical for groups who spent weeks and maybe months away from raw material sources in pursuit of game. Short, exhausted Folsom points or 'slugs' are what archaeologists most commonly find and study. In contrast, a quite long, fully fluted point made from a yet longer preform was the intended product of the Folsom knapper. The model presented here can be tested through study of preform length, finished point proportions, fracture patterns, haft element features, and use-wear analysis in archaeological specimens, as well as actualistic hunting experiments. The engine driving persistent use of snap blade, full fluted projectile technology was focused commitment to a single, highly mobile game species (bison). This specific technofunctional element in Folsom culture reveals a weapon system designed to mitigate against extreme risk regarding access to raw material. Continuing research should demonstrate that the appearance, geographic distribution, persistence, and disappearance of the Folsom fluted point relate closely to juxtapositions of climatic change, biotic change, and human population movements that occurred near the end of the Pleistocene.

Indeed, from the earliest commentaries on the Victoria West, it has frequently been thought of as a 'large Levallois' variant. The hypothesis that VW cores are accurately characterised as 'large Levallois' is tested here using a comparative 3D geometric morphometric (GM) methodology. GM methods are powerful statistical tools for shape analysis that offer many advantages over traditional means of shape quantification and comparison. The use of landmarks to capture shape variation allows for the preservation of the full geometry, as well as enabling the more precise description of shape versus size. Moreover, biological studies have shown that the use of landmarks allows for a flexible approach to comparing specific aspects of overall morphology. Here, we employ GM to analyse differences in core surface morphology in a range of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, including Victoria West examples (total n = 639 artefacts). In comparison with cores from non-handaxe Mode 1, Acheulean handaxes, and Levallois cores, the Victoria West share shape affinities with both Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores. However, when compared directly with a group of large Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores from Baker's Hole (UK), the Victoria West were found to more closely resemble handaxes, while the Baker's Hole set are simply isometrically-scaled Levallois cores. These analyses show that, despite broad technological and qualitative morphological similarities with Levallois cores, Victoria West cores are morphologically more similar to Lower Palaeolithic artefact forms, such as handaxes, and are in some respects distinct from Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores. In line with other recent analyses, our results support suggestions that the Victoria West technique is an extension of longstanding Acheulean traditions for the preparation of biface blanks, but with its own distinct characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a three-part study in which we investigated the transition using radiocarbon dates from Clovis and Folsom sites. In the first part of the study, we used dates from Folsom site-phases to determine when and where Folsom originated. In the second part of the study, we employed Clovis and Folsom dates in analyses designed to determine whether Folsom spread via demic diffusion or cultural diffusion. In the third part of the study we investigated the velocity of the Clovis-Folsom transition. The analyses suggest that Folsom first appeared around 12,800 calBP in the northern High Plains and spread north and south from there. They also suggest that the spread of Folsom was, at least in part, the result of population expansion. In addition, the analyses indicate that the spread of Folsom was relatively fast for a prehistoric diffusion but well below the maximum velocity that has been estimated for such events. These findings, in turn, have implications for the hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the Clovis-Folsom transition. They refute the idea that the Clovis-Folsom transition resulted from an extraterrestrial impact over northern North America at 12,900 ± 100 calBP but are consistent with the alternative proposal that the transition was a response to climate-driven environmental change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Clovis; Demic diffusion; Folsom; Paleoindian; Radiocarbon dates","archaeological evidence; cultural history; cultural tradition; environmental change; human settlement; Paleolithic; radiocarbon dating; spatiotemporal analysis; Great Plains",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955268294

Levallois technology remains an important focus for research in Palaeolithic archaeology, yet quantitative morphological comparisons of Levallois core morphology from different regions remain rare. Here, utilizing Levallois cores from Africa, the Near East, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent, patterns of morphological variability in the shape of the Levallois flaking surface and core outline (margin) shape were examined for patterns of variability and stability across regions using 3D geometric morphometrics. The multivariate statistical shape analyses undertaken revealed a clear pattern: that is, the greatest levels of shape variability in Levallois cores is evident in the form of their outline (planform) shape. Conversely, the geometrical relationship between the margin of the Levallois cores and their topological surface morphology was relatively uniform. This pattern of variability was evident in terms of variation both across regions and between cores from the same locality. These results indicate that the outline form of such cores was a less important variable than the geometric/topological properties of the surface morphology and, in particular, the relationship between the margin of the core and those variables. These results have implications for why it has been reported that replicating such cores in modern experiments is a particularly difficult task. The specific interrelationship between the geometric properties of the core and the core margin provide further evidence that Levallois core technology would be unlikely to emerge from the context of opportunistic migrating platform reduction strategies (such as those seen in many Mode 1 industries). If, as is widely suggested, Levallois cores were deliberate products in Pleistocene contexts, these results also hint that relatively sophisticated means of social transmission (i.e. teaching) may have been required to sustain their production over time and space. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Core variation; Geometric morphometric analysis; Levallois","archaeological evidence; archaeology; geometry; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; technological development; Africa; Europe; India",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871442389

Early Paleoindian foraging: examining the faunal evidence for large mammal specialization and regional variability in prey choice. Quaternary Science Reviews 23, 1955-1987] that the North American archaeofaunal record provides little support for the notion that Early Paleoindians across the continent practiced a uniform subsistence strategy focused on the specialized hunting of large mammals; rather, there is some evidence for regional variability in human subsistence during the Early Paleoindian period (ca. 11,500-10,800 14C yr BP). Here, we further explore the archaeofaunal evidence for regional variability in subsistence behavior, focusing in particular on diet breadth and on the degree to which diets were dominated by large-bodied mammals. We also show how geographic variability in Early Paleoindian foraging can be understood in relation to environmental variability by employing a foraging theory model of patch choice in fractal environments [Ritchie, M.E., 1998. Scale-dependent foraging and patch choice in fractal environments. Evolutionary Ecology 12, 309-330]. Broad-scale patterns of regional variability in Early Paleoindian prey choice are consistent with the explanation-derived from the fractal patch choice model in conjunction with paleoenvironmental data on the ""grain-size"" of terminal Pleistocene environments-that the subsistence strategies of early Americans were sensitive to the tradeoff between searching for and foraging in resource patches in a patchy environment, and that those strategies varied in response to the heterogeneity of the environments that different early American groups inhabited. We conclude by briefly critiquing the use of foraging theory in Early Paleoindian research and by presenting suggestions for future improvements in our understanding of Early Paleoindian subsistence. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeological evidence; diet; foraging behavior; human activity; hunter-gatherer; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; subsistence; North America; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-55049113318

The evidence for the Clovis complex pre-dating 13,000 cal yr BP is equivocal. Artifact assemblages are found at a number of sites in South America that date to 13,000 cal yr BP that have no affinity to Clovis. These data show that both continents were contemporaneously occupied at 13,000 cal yr BP. The absence of Clovis artifacts in Beringia and the geographic concentration of the Clovis complex in North America south of the continental ice sheets indicate that Clovis likely originated somewhere in the continental United States from an antecedent group. Several archaeological sites in North and South America provide credible evidence for the occupation of the Americas before Clovis, and these sites date back to ca. 15,000 cal yr BP, some 2000 calendar years before Clovis. Artifacts from these sites show that these early people made and utilized bifaces, blades, bladelets, and osseous tools. A migration of people into the Americas, a few thousand years prior to Clovis, is supported by the modern genetic evidence. The presence of people in the Americas prior to Clovis also correlates with the initial decline in megafaunal populations during the fifteenth and fourteenth millennia.

Analyses of spacings and frequency distributions of radiocarbon dates for each region support the idea that the extinction event first commenced in Beringia, roughly 13,300-15,000 BP. For the United States and South America, extinctions commenced considerably later but were closely spaced in time. For the contiguous United States, extinction began at ca. 12,900-13,200 BP, and at ca. 12,600-13,900 BP in South America.

We use spatial and assemblage content data from a sample of 619 Folsom sites located throughout the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and Southwest to evaluate whether the archaeological record actually reflects these characteristics. Three spatial scales of analysis are utilized. First, site scale analysis of a subset of sites shows a great deal of variability in spatial and temporal characteristics. Sites can be roughly divided into small, single occupation locales and large, serially occupied sites. Second, day-to-day foraging occurs at what we term the foraging scale. This intermediate spatial scale is poorly understood for Folsom groups, though large sites such as Blackwater Draw and Lindenmeier provide clues that are supplemented by information from the ethnographic record. Third, the macro-regional scale analysis utilizes the entire site sample and indicates that the Folsom archaeological record consists primarily of small locales scattered across the landscape punctuated by only a few large, serially occupied sites. Overall, our analysis suggests that Folsom adaptive systems were more variable than normally recognized, and, in certain settings, may have been characterized by reduced residential mobility. Furthermore, we postulate that Folsom land use, rather than being conditioned primarily by mobile prey, may have been at least partly conditioned by more predictable resources such as wood, water, and toolstone.

For Clovis peoples, the earliest well-documented North Americans, resharpening is believed to have been particularly important because foraging territories were unknown or poorly known. Gardner (1983, Archaeol East N Amer 11, 49-64) proposed a spatial model of Clovis point resharpening wherein the effects of resharpening increase with distance from stone outcrop. Here we report a study that quantitatively assesses Gardner's model using a large sample of Clovis points from three high-quality chert sources in the Midwest. To investigate the predictions of the model, we used least-cost pathway distances from outcrop locations to each Clovis point and three measures of point resharpening. Our expectations, derived from the model, are that as distance from outcrop increases, points should show evidence of increased resharpening and therefore be smaller in size; should deviate from the classic shape; and should exhibit greater outer-to-inner flake-scar ratios. Our results indicate that there is no spatial patterning of these three measures of point resharpening and therefore do not support Gardner's model. Further analyses suggest that resharpening was not a significant source of Clovis-point variation at the population level and that Clovis points in the Midwest may not have served as the long-life tools as has been generally assumed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Clovis; Flake-scar pattern; Geometric morphometrics; Great Lakes; Least-cost pathway; Resharpening",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929612436

Comparisons exploring the adaptive changes that took place during this period frequently employ regional-scale approaches. The focus on regional-scale analyses largely results from the dearth of sites repeatedly visited by multiple early Paleoindian groups. However, regional-scale comparisons have the potential to overlook smaller-scale differences. The Debra L.

This paper presents the context and chronology of the Midland, Folsom, and Clovis assemblages and a site-scale analysis of lithics from the Friedkin site. It is argued that point production and late-stage reduction were primary activities, and the use of bifacial cores for flake tools was important throughout these occupation periods.

We argue that disproportional visibility and research effort devoted to these types of sites has resulted in a highly skewed view of prehistoric lifeways, that is, of a life focused on the hunting of single animal species. Our research shows that approximately 98% of sites are not bonebeds, and thus leads to the question of ""What is the faunal evidence from the rest of the sites?"" This paper presents a preliminary examination of Paleoindian age faunal remains from non-bonebed contexts on the western North American Plains and adjacent Rocky Mountains.

Since these physical properties are integrated to accomplish that function, examining design variables and their pattern of integration or modularity is of interest to estimate the past function of a point. Here we analyze a composite sample of lithic points from southern Patagonia likely formed by arrows, thrown spears and hand-held points to test if they can be viewed as a two-module system formed by the blade and the stem, and to evaluate the degree in which shape, size, asymmetry, blade: stem length ratio, and tip angle explain the observed variance and differentiation among points supposedly aimed to accomplish different functions. To do so we performed a geometric morphometric analysis on 118 lithic points, departing from 24 two-dimensional landmark and semi landmarks placed on the point's contour. Klingenberg's covariational modularity tests were used to evaluate different modularity hypotheses, and a composite PCA including shape, size, asymmetry, blade: stem length ratio, and tip angle was used to estimate the importance of each attribute to explaining variation patterns. Results show that the blade and the stem can be seen as ""near decomposable units"" in the points integrating the studied sample. However, this modular pattern changes after removing the effects of reduction. Indeed, a resharpened point tends to show a tip/rest of the point modular pattern. The composite PCA analyses evidenced three different patterns of morphometric attributes compatible with arrows, thrown spears, and hand-held tools. Interestingly, when analyzed independently, these groups show differences in their modular organization. Our results indicate that stone tools can be approached as flexible designs, characterized by a composite set of interacting morphometric attributes, and evolving on a modular way. © 2012 Gonzalez-Jose, Charlin.",,"Argentina; arrow; article; blade; Chile; lithic point weapon; morphometrics; prehistoric period; principal component analysis; sample; spear; stone tool; variance; weapon; History, Ancient; Humans; Principal Component Analysis; South America; Weapons",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867685134

So far, however, the impact of resharpening on the distinctiveness of the blades of Paleoindian projectile points has not been investigated quantitatively. With this in mind, we used geometric morphometric techniques to compare the blades of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points from the Southern Plains of North America. We evaluated two hypotheses. The first was that blade shape distinguishes the three types. We found that blade shape distinguished Clovis points from both Folsom and Plainview points, but did not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The second hypothesis we tested was that resharpening eliminates blade shape differences among the types. To test this hypothesis, we used size as a proxy for -resharpening. The results of this analysis were similar to those obtained in the first analysis. Thus, our study suggests that, contrary to what is often assumed, resharpening does not automatically undermine the use of blade shape in Paleoindian projectile point typologies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871436910

According to this hypothesis, hafting constrained point bases such that they are less variable than point blades. The results of several studies have been claimed to be consistent with this hypothesis. However, there are reasons to be skeptical of these results. None of the studies employed statistical tests, and all of them focused on points recovered from kill and camp sites, which makes it difficult to be certain that the differences in variability are the result of hafting rather than a consequence of resharpening. Here, we report a study in which we tested the predictions of the hafting hypothesis by statistically comparing the variability of different parts of Clovis points. We controlled for the potentially confounding effects of resharpening by analyzing largely unused points from caches as well as points from kill and camp sites. The results of our analyses were not consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis. We found that several blade characters and point thickness were no more variable than the base characters. Our results indicate that the hafting hypothesis does not hold for Clovis points and indicate that there is a need to test its applicability in relation to post-Clovis Paleoindian points. © 2012 Buchanan et al.",,"archeology; article; Clovis point; confounding variable; controlled study; correlation coefficient; environmental impact assessment; hypothesis; North America; prediction; archeology; human; methodology; tool use; Archaeology; Humans; North America; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861621113

We compared standardized models of fluted and unfluted points: analytically, by way of static, linear finite element modeling and discrete, deteriorating spring modeling; and experimentally, by way of displacement-controlled axial-compression tests. We found evidence that the fluted-point base acts as a “shock absorber,” increasing point robustness and ability to withstand physical stress via stress redistribution and damage relocation.

Previous work evaluating the roles of climate change and human activity in the North American megafaunal extinction has been stymied by a reliance on geographic binning, yielding contradictory results among researchers. We used a fine-scale geospatial approach in combination with 95 megafaunal last-appearance and 75 human first-appearance radiocarbon dates to evaluate the North American megafaunal extinction. We used kriging to create interpolated first- and last-appearance surfaces from calibrated radiocarbon dates in combination with their geographic autocorrelation. We found substantial evidence for overlap between megafaunal and human populations in many but not all areas, in some cases exceeding 3000 years of predicted overlap. We also found that overlap was highly regional: megafauna had last appearances in Alaska before humans first appeared, but did not have last appearances in the Great Lakes region until several thousand years after the first recorded human appearances. Overlap in the Great Lakes region exceeds uncertainty in radiocarbon measurements or methodological uncertainty and would be even greater with sampling-derived confidence intervals. The kriged maps of last megafaunal occurrence are consistent with climate as a primary driver in some areas, but we cannot eliminate human influence from all regions. The late Pleistocene megafaunal extinction was highly variable in timing and duration of human overlap across the continent, and future analyses should take these regional trends into account. © Copyright 2017 The Paleontological Society.

Stanford, and J. S. Day, 193–229. Boulder: University Press of Colorado), is that mobile Folsom bands shifted from making Folsom points, which often fatally broke during the production process, to less risky Midland points as stone supplies dwindled. In cultural evolutionary terms, this hypothesis proposes that an increase in local, site-scale functional controls, specifically stone supply stress, resulted in the modification of the existing Folsom point production recipe and led to the adoption of a new cultural variant, the Midland point.

Camp sites are assumed to be more indicative of long-term, average Early Paleo-Indian diet, but single-event kill sites and multiple-event kill sites are included in analyses.
