Computing Center, 550 Lipoa Parkway, Maui, HI 96753, United States","The problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely disconnected research traditions: evolutionary biology and evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation, recombination and selection is not universally effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For adaptation to occur, these systems must possess 'evolvability,' i.e., the ability of random variations to sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the variability of characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to be distinguished from variations, which are the actually realized differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is the common theme underlying such varied biological phenomena as genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological versatility, developmental dissociability, and morphological integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem has important implications: how is it that extant species acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by mutation and selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to change in evolution'? What are the selective forces, if any, that shape the genotype- phenotype map? We propose that the genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two main routes, epistatic mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for organismic design is modularity. By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects among characters serving different functions, with pleiotropic effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single functional complex. Such a design is expected to improve evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation of different functions. Several population genetic models are reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of a modular design. While our current knowledge is insufficient to assess the plausibility of these models, they form the beginning of a framework for understanding the evolution of the genotype phenotype map.","Adaptation; evolution of development; evolutionary computation; genetic representations; modularity; pleiotropy; quantitative genetics","evolvability; genetic representation; mutation; phenotypic variation; recombination; selection",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029661332

These units can be considered as modular parts of the body which integrate functionally related characters into units of evolutionary transformation. These units may either emerge spontaneously by self-organization, or may be the product of natural selection. A selection scenario that could explain the origin of modular units needs to explain the differential suppression of pleiotropic effects between different modules and the augmentation of pleiotropic effects among the elements within the module. Four scenarios are discussed: selection for adaptation rate, constructional selection, stabilizing selection and a combination of directional and stabilizing selection.

Here, phenotypic covariance and correlation structure is compared among Platyrrhine Neotropical primates. Comparisons range from among species within a genus to the superfamily level. Matrix correlation followed by Mantel's test and vector correlation among responses to random natural selection vectors (random skewers) were used to compare correlation and variance/covariance matrices of 39 skull traits. Sampling errors involved in matrix estimates were taken into account in comparisons using matrix repeatability to set upper limits for each pairwise comparison. Results indicate that covariance structure is not strictly constant but that the amount of variance pattern divergence observed among taxa is generally low and not associated with taxonomic distance. Specific instances of divergence are identified. There is no correlation between the amount of divergence in covariance patterns among the 16 genera and their phylogenetic distance derived from a conjoint analysis of four already published nuclear gene datasets. In contrast, there is a significant correlation between phylogenetic distance and morphological distance (Mahalanobis distance among genus centroids). This result indicates that while the phenotypic means were evolving during the last 30 millions years of New World monkey evolution, phenotypic covariance structures of Neotropical primate skulls have remained relatively consistent. Neotropical primates can be divided into four major groups based on their feeding habits (fruit-leaves, seed-fruits, insect-fruits, and gum-insect-fruits). Differences in phenotypic covariance structure are correlated with differences in feeding habits, indicating that to some extent changes in interrelationships among skull traits are associated with changes in feeding habits. Finally, common patterns and levels of morphological integration are found among Platyrrhine primates, suggesting that functional/developmental integration could be one major factor keeping covariance structure relatively stable during evolutionary diversification of South American monkeys.","Cranial morphology; Developmental modularity; Morphological integration; Phenotypic covariance structure; Phylogeny; Platyrrhini; Quantitative genetics","cranium; evolution; genetic variation; morphology; phenology; primate; Insecta; Mammalia; Platyrrhini; Primates; Vertebrata; animal; article; biological model; Cebidae; classification; evolution; genetic variability; genetics; histology; phenotype; phylogeny; reproducibility; skull; Animals; Cebidae; Evolution; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035544555

We used the methods of geometric morphometrics to reassess the hypothesis that the mandible consists of two separate modules: an anterior part bearing the teeth and a posterior part with muscle attachment surfaces and articulating with the skull. The analyses particularly focused on covariation of fluctuating asymmetry, because such covariation is due exclusively to direct interactions between the developmental processes that produce the traits of interest, whereas variation of traits among individuals also reflects other factors. The patterns of fluctuating asymmetry and individual variation were only partly consistent, indicating that developmental processes contribute differentially to variation at different levels. The results were in agreement with the hypothesis that the anterior and posterior parts of the mandible are separate developmental modules. Comparison of all alternative partitions of the landmarks into two contiguous subsets confirmed the hypothesis for the location of the boundary between modules but also underscored that the separation between them is not complete. Modularity is therefore manifest as the relative independence of parts within the framework of overall integration of the mandible as a whole - it is a matter of degrees, not all or nothing.",,"evolution; morphology; rodent; skull; analysis of variance; animal; article; biological model; comparative study; cross breeding; growth, development and aging; mandible; maxillofacial development; morphometrics; mouse; physiology; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Body Weights and Measures; Crosses, Genetic; Mandible; Maxillofacial Development; Mice; Models, Biological; Animalia; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141564962

This integration of variation between functionally related body parts and the modular organization of development are fundamental determinants of their evolvability. This is because integration results in the expression of coordinated variation that can create preferred directions for evolutionary change, while modularity enables variation in a group of traits or regions to accumulate without deleterious effects on other aspects of the organism. Using our own work on both model systems (e. g., lab mice, avians) and natural populations of rodents and primates, we explore in this paper the relationship between patterns of phenotypic covariation and the developmental determinants of integration that those patterns are assumed to reflect. We show that integration cannot be reliably studied through phenotypic covariance patterns alone and argue that the relationship between phenotypic covariation and integration is obscured in two ways. One is the superimposition of multiple determinants of covariance in complex systems and the other is the dependence of covariation structure on variances in covariance-generating processes. As a consequence, we argue that the direct study of the developmental determinants of integration in model systems is necessary to fully interpret patterns of covariation in natural populations, to link covariation patterns to the processes that generate them, and to understand their significance for evolutionary explanation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Covariation; Developmental constraints; Evolvability; Mice; Morphological integration; Morphometrics; Primates; Rodents","Mus; Primates; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-72249110894

Canalization is the tendency for development of a specific genotype to follow the same trajectory under different conditions (different environments or different genetic backgrounds), while developmental stability is the tendency for the development of a specific genotype to follow the same trajectory under the same conditions. Morphological integration refers to the tendency for structures to show correlated variation because they develop in response to shared developmental processes or function in concert with other structures. All three phenomena are emergent properties of developmental systems that can affect the interaction of development and evolution. In this paper, we review the topics of canalization, developmental stability, and morphological integration and their relevance to primate and human evolution. We then test three developmentally motivated hypotheses about the patterning of variability components in the mammalian limb. We find that environmental variances and fluctuating asymmetries (FA) increase distally along the limb in adult macaques but not in fetal mice. We infer that the greater variability of more distal segments in macaques is due to postnatal mechanical effects. We also find that heritability and FA are significantly correlated when different limb measurements are compared in fetal mice. This supports the idea that the mechanisms underlying canalization and developmental stability are related. Finally, we report that the covariation structure of fore- and hindlimb skeletal elements shows evidence for morphological integration between serially homologous structures between the limbs. This is evidence for the existence of developmental modules that link structures between the limbs. Such modules would produce covariation that would need to be overcome by selection for divergence in hind- and forelimb morphology.

While molecular biologists use genetically homogeneous strains of model organisms to avoid this variation, evolutionary biologists embrace genetic variation as the material of evolution since heritable differences in fitness drive evolutionary change. Yet, the relationship between the phenotypic variation affecting fitness and the genotypic variation producing it is complex. Genetic buffering mechanisms modify this relationship by concealing the effects of genetic and environmental variation on phenotype. Genetic buffering allows the build-up and storage of genetic variation in phenotypically normal populations. When buffering breaks down, thresholds governing the expression of previously silent variation are crossed. At these thresholds, phenotypic differences suddenly appear and are available for selection. Thus, buffering mechanisms modulate evolution and regulate a balance between evolutionary stasis and change. Recent work provides a glimpse of the molecular details governing some types of genetic buffering. BioEssays 22:1095-1105, 2000.

However, the relationship between the physical properties of different foods and the motor response is poorly understood. In this study, we developed edible and well-controlled model foods in order to describe some of the stimulus-response functions of the food-mastication loop. Four gelatine-based visco-elastic model foods identical in shape and size but differing in hardness were prepared. They displayed reproducible sensory and physical characteristics and were distributed on a wide hardness scale. Electromyographic activity of masseter and temporalis muscles and jaw movements in the frontal plane were simultaneously recorded during mastication in 15 young men with intact dentition and good oral status. Almost all EMG and jaw movement parameters were clearly affected by increasing hardness of model foods. However, it is possible to summarise the results by reducing the number of parameters to three: the number of chewing cycles, EMG activity of any one of the two temporal or the two masseter muscles and the amplitude of the opening mandibular movements. Indeed, these were the best transcriptors of the hardness range of the model foods used in this study. As inferred from these parameter recordings, the food hardness modifications were strongest during the first five strokes, began as early as the first stroke and lasted for the whole sequence.","Electromyography; Food texture; Jaw movements; Mastication; Model food","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; dentition; electromyogram; feedback system; food; hardness; human; human experiment; jaw movement; male; mandible; mastication; model; muscle contraction; parameter; priority journal; stimulus response; Adult; Bite Force; Elasticity; Electromyography; Exertion; Feedback; Female; Humans; Jaw; Male; Masseter Muscle; Mastication; Masticatory Muscles; Models, Biological; Muscle Contraction; Proprioception; Stress, Mechanical; Temporal Muscle",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036135177

Samples were grouped according to their temporal location and subsistence pattern, and represent a transition from a hunting‐gathering adaptation (Mesolithic) to a transitional hunting‐gathering‐agricultural adaptation (A‐C Group) and finally to a fully agricultural adaptation (Meroitic/X‐Group/Christian). The purposes were: (1) to compare the Mesolithic sample with the later Nubian populations; and (2) to evaluate further the hypothesis that change in Nubian craniofacial morphology was due to changing functional demands associated with the progressive change in subsistence adaptation and associated behavior. The results tend to support recent views that the Nubian Mesolithic population is probably ancestral to later Nubian groups, and that the masticatory‐functional hypothesis can best account for craniofacial change among the Nubians since 12,000 B.P. According to this hypothesis systematic reduction in functional demand placed on the masticatory complex from the Mesolithic led, secondarily, to an alteration of the growth of the maxillomandibular complex such that the face became progressively less robust and more inferoposteriorly located relative to the cranial vault. Both the increase in the height of the vault relative to its length, producing a more “globular” appearance, and the reduction in dental size were tertiary, compensatory responses to altered facial size and position.

We used a single injection of decamethonium iodide to paralyze embryos at 7, 8, or 10 days of incubation and analyzed the growth of individual bones (clavicle, mandible, ulna, femur, tibia, humerus) and of individual muscles that act upon some of those bones (clavicular and sternal heads of m. pectoralis, and mm. biceps brachii, depressor mandibulae, pseudotemporalis, and adductor externus). Growth of the bones is not equally affected by paralysis. Only 27% of clavicular growth (by mass) but 77% of mandibular growth occurred in paralyzed embryos, whereas the four long bones exhibited 52–63% of their normal growth. Analysis of muscle weight, fiber length and physiological cross‐sectional area (weight/fiber length) indicate that there was greater reduction of the muscles acting on the limbs than of those acting on the mandible, i.e., diminished growth of the skeleton is correlated with reduced muscular activity. Specific retardation of clavicular growth is due to fusion of sternal rudiments and collapse of the thorax, as well as virtual absence of the musculature that normally attaches to the clavicle. We discuss these results in the light of intrinsic and extrinsic factors governing growth of tne embryonic skeleton. Paralysis reduces skeletal growth by reducing both the movements taking place in ovo, and the loads imposed on the bones by muscle contraction, changes that represent alterations in the mechanical environment of the skeleton.

The aim of this work was to compare the effects of an increase in hardness of two model food types, presenting either elastic or plastic rheological properties, on mastication. Each model food type consisted of four products of different hardness. Sensory testing experiments conducted with one group of 14 subjects showed significant perceived differences between products in terms of their increasing hardness. Fifteen other volunteers were asked to chew three replicates of each elastic and plastic product during two sessions. EMGs of masseter and temporalis muscles were recorded simultaneously with jaw movement during chewing. Numerous variables were analyzed from these masticatory recordings. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the respective effects of food hardness and rheological properties on variables characterizing either the whole masticatory sequence or different stages of the sequence. Muscle activities were significantly affected by an increase in hardness regardless of the food type, whereas the shape of the cycles depended on the rheological properties. The masticatory frequency was affected by hardness at the initial stage of the sequence but overall frequency adaptation was better explained by a change in rheological behavior, with plastic products being chewed at a slower frequency. A dual hypothesis was proposed, implicating first a cortical-brain stem preprogrammed mechanism to adapt the shape of the jaw movements to the rheological properties of the food, and second, a brain stem mechanism with mainly sensory feedback from the mouth to adapt muscle force to the food hardness.

The sutures between bony elements provide for interstitial growth of the cranium, but at the same time they alter the transmission of stress and strain through the skull. Strain gages were bonded to the frontal and parietal bones of miniature pigs and across the interfrontal, interparietal and coronal sutures. Strains were recorded 1) during natural mastication in conjunction with electromyographic activity from the jaw muscles and 2) during stimulation of various cranial muscles in anesthetized animals. Vault sutures exhibited vastly higher strains than did the adjoining bones. Further, bone strain primarily reflected torsion of the braincase set up by asymmetrical muscle contraction; the tensile axis alternated between +45°and -45°depending on which diagonal masseter/temporalis pair was most active. However, suture strains were not related to overall torsion but instead were responses to local muscle actions. Only the coronal suture showed significant strain (tension) during jaw opening; this was caused by the contraction of neck muscles. All sutures showed strain during jaw closing, but polarity depended on the pattern of muscle usage. For example, masseter contraction tensed the coronal suture and the anterior part of the interfrontal suture, whereas the temporalis caused compression in these locations. Peak tensile strains were larger than peak compressive strains. Histology suggested that the skull is bent at the sutures, with the ectocranial surface tensed and the endocranial surface predominantly compressed. Collectively, these results indicate that skulls with patent sutures should be analyzed as complexes of independent parts rather than solid structures.

This was done by measuring and analyzing patterns of in vivo bone strain recorded from three‐element rosette strain gages bonded to the supraorbital region and to other portions of the bony face of Macaca fascicularis and Papio anubis during mastication and incision. The magnitude and direction of the principal strains recorded support Endo's hypothesis that the supraorbital region during mastication and incision is bent in the frontal plane (Endo, 1966). Our data do not, however, support his hypothesis that the supraorbital region is bent more during incision than during mastication. The data also demonstrate that overall levels of supraorbital strain are not larger in more prognathic subjects. Most importantly, the data indicate that the supraorbital region of nonhuman catarrhines is strained very little during mastication and incision. This indicates that there is much more supraorbital bone than is necessary both to counter masticatory loads and to provide an adequate safety factor to failure for these loads. This in turn suggests that the macaque and baboon browridges can be considerably reduced in size and still maintain these required structural characteristics. Thus, our experiments provide no support whatsoever for those hypotheses that directly link browridge morphology to masticatory stress (cf. Endo, 1966; Russell, 1983, 1985). A recent review of Endo's original work indicates that this latter statement is also true for humans (Picq and Hylander, 1989). We conclude, therefore, that there is no good reason to believe that enlarged browridges in living and/or fossil primates are structural adaptations to counter intense masticatory forces. The evolution of browridge morphology in primates is best explained on the basis of factors related to the position of the brain relative to the orbits (Moss and Young, 1960). When these structures are widely separated, as in gorillas, the large intervening space must be bridged with bone. In addition, enough bone must be present within the supraorbital and bridged regions to prevent structural failure due to non‐masticatory external forces associated with highly active primates (e.g., accidental traumatic forces applied to the orbits and neurocranium). This requirement results in both pronounced browridges and in much more supraorbital bone than is necessary to counter routine cyclical stress during mastication and incision. This in turn explains why bone strains recorded from the supraorbital region are extremely small relative to other portions of the primate face during mastication and incision.

Experimental data from pigs and armadillos indicate that CVT increases more rapidly in exercised juveniles than in genetically similar controls, despite the low levels of strain generated by chewing or locomotion in the neurocranium. CVT increases in these individuals appear to be a consequence of systemic cortical bone growth induced by exercise. In addition, an analysis of the variability in vault thickness in the genus Homo demonstrates that, until the Holocene, there has been only a slight, general decrease in vault thickness over time with no consistent significant differences between archaic and early anatomically modern humans from the Late Pleistocene. Although there may be some genetic component to variation in CVT, exercise-related, non-genetically heritable stimuli appear to account for most of the variance between individuals. The thick cranial vaults of most hunter-gatherers and early agriculturalists suggests that they may have experienced higher levels of sustained exercise relative to body mass than the majority of recent, post-industrial humans.","Armadillos; Cortical bone; Homo; Neurocranium; Pigs; Robusticity; Skull","animal experiment; animal tissue; armadillo; article; bone growth; bone maturation; cortical bone; exercise; female; human; human tissue; male; nonhuman; skull; swine; Animals; Armadillos; Bone Development; Exercise; Female; Fossils; Humans; Male; Skull; Species Specificity; Swine; Swine, Miniature",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029758901

While there is considerable comparative evidence to support this idea, most experimental tests of this hypothesis have been on non-human primates or other very prognathic mammals (rodents, swine) raised on hard versus very soft (nearly liquid) diets. Here, we examine facial growth and in vivo strains generated in response to raw/dried foods versus cooked foods in a retrognathic mammal, the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis). The results indicate that the hyrax cranium resembles the non-human primate cranium in having a steep gradient of strains from the occlusal to orbital regions, but differs from most non-anthropoids in being primarily twisted; the hyrax mandible is bent both vertically and laterally. In general, higher strains, as much as two-fold at some sites, are generated by masticating raw versus cooked food. Hyraxes raised on cooked food had significantly less growth (approximately 10%) in the ventral (inferior) and posterior portions of the face, where strains are highest, resembling many of the differences evident between humans raised on highly processed versus less processed diets.

To address this problem, we selected 22 subjects with different facial morphologies and used magnetic resonance imaging, cephalometric radiography, and data from dental casts to reconstruct their craniofacial tissues in three dimensions. Conventional cephalometric analyses were carried out, and the cross‐sectional sizes of the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles were measured from reconstituted sections. The potential abilities of the muscles to generate bite forces at the molar teeth and mandibular condyles were calculated according to static equilibrium theory using muscle, first molar, and condylar moment arms. On average, the masseter muscle was about 66% larger in cross section than the medial pterygoid and was inclined more anteriorly relative to the functional occlusal plane. There was a significant positive correlation (P < 0.01) between the cross‐sectional areas of the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles (r = 0.75) and between the bizygomatic arch width and masseter cross‐sectional area (r = 0.56) and medial pterygoid cross‐sectional area (r = 0.69). The masseter muscle was always a more efficient producer of vertically oriented bite force than the medial pterygoid. Putative bite force from the medial pterygoid muscle alone correlated positively with mandibular length and inversely with upper face height. When muscle and tooth moment arms were considered together, a system efficient at producing force on the first molar was statistically associated with a face having a large intergonial width, small intercondylar width, narrow dental arch, forward maxilla, and forward mandible. There was no significant correlation between muscle cross‐sectional areas and their respective putative bite forces. This suggests that there is no simple relationship between the tension‐generating capacity of the muscles and their mechanical efficiency as described by their spatial arrangement. The study shows that in a modern human population so many combinations of biomechanically relevant variables are possible that subjects cannot easily be placed into ideal or nonideal categories for producing molar force. Our findings also confirm the impression that similar bite‐force efficiencies can be found in subjects with disparate facial features.

From the beginning of the Post-Pleistocene until the present, the overall rate of dental reduction doubled.

Late Pleistocene rates are comparable in Europe and the Middle East. The Post-Pleistocene rates are also the same for Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, and SE Asia. It is suggested that the cookery at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene allowed the earlier changes to occur.

Integration is relevant in evolutionary biology as it imposes constraint on the variation that is exposed to selection, and is at the same time often based on heritable genetic correlations. Several measures have been proposed to assess the amount of integration, many using the distribution of eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. In this paper, we analyze the properties of eigenvalue variance as a much applied measure. We show that eigenvalue variance scales linearly with the square of the mean correlation and propose the standard deviation of the eigenvalues as a suitable alternative that scales linearly with the correlation. We furthermore develop a relative measure that is independent of the number of traits and can thus be readily compared across datasets. We apply this measure to examples of phenotypic correlation matrices and compare our measure to several other methods. The relative standard deviation of the eigenvalues gives similar results as the mean absolute correlation (W.P. Cane, Evol Int J Org Evol 47:844-854, 1993) but is only identical to this measure if the correlation matrix is homogenous. For heterogeneous correlation matrices the mean absolute correlation is consistently smaller than the relative standard deviation of eigenvalues and may thus underestimate integration. Unequal allocation of variance due to variation among correlation coefficients is captured by the relative standard deviation of eigenvalues. We thus suggest that this measure is a better reflection of the overall morphological integration than the average correlation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Eigenvalue distribution; Evolutionary constraint; Morphological integration; Phenotypic correlation",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-69849103645

Wolff's law, however, is not always true, and in fact comprises a variety of different processes that are best considered separately. Here we review the molecular and physiological mechanisms by which bone senses, transduces, and responds to mechanical loads, and the effects of aging processes on the relationship (if any) between cortical bone form and mechanical function. Experimental and comparative evidence suggests that cortical bone is primarily responsive to strain prior to sexual maturity, both in terms of the rate of new bone growth (modeling) as well as rates of turnover (Haversian remodeling). Rates of modeling and Haversian remodeling, however, vary greatly at different skeletal sites. In addition, there is no simple relationship between the orientation of loads in long bone diaphyses and their cross-sectional geometry. In combination, these data caution against assuming without testing adaptationist views about form-function relationships in order to infer adult activity patterns from skeletal features such as cross-sectional geometry, cortical bones density, and musculo-skeletal stress markers.

Inferences from how known developmental perturbations produce phenotypic effects in model organisms, such as mice, to how the same perturbations would affect craniofacial form in primates must be informed by comparisons of phenotypic variation and variability in mice and the primate species of interest. We use morphometric methods to compare patterns of cranial variability in homologous datasets obtained for two strains of laboratory mice and rhesus macaques. C57BL/6J represents a common genetic background for transgenic models. A/WySnJ mice exhibit altered facial morphology which results from reduction in the growth of the maxillary process during formation of the face. This is relevant to evolutionary changes in facial prognathism in nonhuman primate and human evolution. Rhesus macaques represent a nonhuman primate about which a great deal of phenotypic and genetic information is available. We find significant similarities in covariation patterns between the C57BL/6J mice and macaques. Among-trait variation in genetic and phenotypic variances are fairly concordant among the three groups, but among-trait variation in developmental stability is not. Finally, analysis of modularity based on phenotypic and genetic correlations did not reveal a consistent pattern in the three groups.

This septum, formed by the frontal, alisphenoid, and zygomatic bones, separates the orbital contents from the temporal muscles. Three hypotheses suggest that the postorbital septum evolved to resist stresses acting on the skull during mastication or incision. The facial- torsion hypothesis posits that the septum resists twisting of the face about a rostrocaudal axis during unilateral mastication; the transverse-bending hypothesis argues that the septum resists caudally directed forces acting at the lateral orbital margin during mastication or incision; and the tension hypothesis suggests that the septum resists ventrally directed components of masseter muscle force during mastication and incision. This study evaluates these hypotheses using in vitro and in vivo bone strain data recorded from the circumorbital region of owl monkeys. Incisor loading of an owl monkey skull in vitro bends the face upward in the sagittal plane, compressing the interorbital region rostrocaudally and 'buckling' the lateral orbital walls. Unilateral loading of the toothrow in vitro also bends the face in the sagittal plane, compressing the interorbital region rostrocaudally and buckling the working side lateral orbital wall. When the lateral orbital wall is partially cut, so as to reduce the width of its attachment to the braincase, the following changes in circumorbital bone strain patterns occur. During loading of the incisors, lower bone strain magnitudes are recorded in the interorbital region and lateral orbital walls. In contrast, during unilateral loading of the P3, higher bone strain magnitudes are observed in the interorbital region, and generally lower bone strain magnitudes are observed in the lateral orbital walls. During unilateral loading of the M2, higher bone strain magnitudes are observed in both the interorbital region and in the lateral orbital wall ipsilateral to the loaded molar. Comparisons of the in vitro results with data gathered in vivo suggest that, during incision and unilateral mastication, the face is subjected to upward bending in the sagittal plane resulting in rostrocaudal compression of the interorbital region. Modeling the lateral orbital walls as curved plates suggests that during mastication the working side wall is buckled due to the dorsally directed component of the maxillary bite force which causes upward bending of the face in the sagittal plane. The balancing side lateral orbital wall may also be buckled due to upward bending of the face in the sagittal plane as well as being twisted by the caudoventrally directed components of the superficial masseter muscle force. The in vivo data do not exclude the possibility that the postorbital septum functions to improve the structural integrity of the postorbital bar during mastication. However, there is no reason to believe that a more robust postorbital bar could not also perform this function. Hypotheses stating that the postorbital septum originally evolved to reinforce the skull against routine masticatory loads must explain why, rather than evolving a postorbital septum, the stem anthropoids did not simply enlarge their postorbital bars.","Anthropoid origins; Evolutionary morphology; Lateral orbital wall; Mastication","anthropoidea; anthropology; article; masseter muscle; mastication; orbit; Animals; Aotidae; Female; Male; Mastication; Models, Anatomic; Orbit; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029764403

Constancy of phenotypic covariances is unlikely without constancy of genetic covariation if the latter is a substantial component of the former. If phenotypic patterns are found to be relatively stable, the most probable explanation is that genetic covariance matrices are also stable. Factors like morphological integration account for such stability. Morphological integration can be studied by analyzing the relationships among morphological traits. We present here a comparison of phenotypic correlation and covariance structure among worldwide human populations. Correlation and covariance matrices between 47 cranial traits were obtained for 28 populations, and compared with design matrices representing functional and developmental constraints. Among-population differences in patterns of correlation and covariation were tested for association with matrices of genetic distances (obtained after an examination of 10 Alu-insertions) and with Mahalanobis distances (computed after craniometrical traits). All matrix correlations were estimated by means of Mantel tests. Results indicate that correlation and covariance structure in our species is stable, and that among-group correlation/covariance similarity is not related to genetic or phenotypic distance. Conversely, genetic and morphological distance matrices were highly correlated. Correlation and covariation patterns were largely associated with functional and developmental factors, which probably account for the stability of covariance patterns. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Covariance matrices; Craniometrics; Molecular distances; Morphological distances","article; correlation analysis; craniometry; genetic distance; human; morphological adaptation; phenotypic variation; population differentiation; population research; skull; Alu Elements; Cephalometry; Evolution; Gene Frequency; Humans; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Skull; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347419489

In vivo bone strain data were recorded from the medial orbital wall in an owl monkey (Aotus), rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and a galago (Otolemur) during feeding. These data were used to determine whether: the interorbital region can be modeled as a simple beam under bending or shear; the face is twisting on the brain case during unilateral biting or mastication; the interorbital ""pillar"" is being axially compressed during incisor loading and both axially compressed and laterally bent during mastication; and the interorbital ""pillar"" transmits axial compressive forces from the toothrow to the braincase. The strain data reveal that the interorbital region cannot be modeled as a anteroposteriorly oriented beam bent superiorly in the sagittal plane during incision or mastication. The strain orientations recorded in the majority of experiments are concordant with those predicted for a short beam under shear, although the anthropoids displayed evidence of multiple loading regimes in the medial orbital wall. Strain orientation data corroborate the hypothesis that the strepsirrhine face is twisted during mastication. The hypothesis that the interorbital region is a member in a rigid frame subjected to axial compression during mastication receives some support. The hypothesis that the interorbital region is a member in a rigid frame subjected to lateral bending during mastication is supported by the ε1/|ε2| ratio data but not by the strain orientation data. The timing of peak shear strains in the medial orbital wall of anthropoids does not bear a consistent relationship to the timing of peak shear strain in the mandibular corpus, suggesting that bite force is not the only external force influencing the medial orbital wall. Strain orientation data suggest the existence of two distinct loading regimes, possibly associated with masseter or medial pterygoid contraction. Regardless of the loading regime, all taxa showed low strain magnitudes in the medial orbital wall relative to the anterior root of the zygoma and the mandibular corpus. The strain gradients documented here and elsewhere suggest that, in anthropoids at least, local effects of external forces are more important than a single global loading regime. The low strain magnitudes in the medial orbital wall and in other thin bony plates around the orbit suggest that these structures are not optimally designed for resisting feeding forces. It is hypothesized that their function is to provide rigid support and protection for soft-tissue structures such as the nasal epithelium, the brain, meninges, and the eye and its adnexa. In contrast with the face of Otolemur, which appears to be subjected to a single predominant loading regime, anthropoids may experience different loading regimes in different parts of the face. This implies that the anthropoid and strepsirrhine facial skulls might be optimized for different functions. © 200l Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Bone strain; Evolution; Mastication; Primates","article; craniofacial morphology; evolution; feeding; mastication; monkey; nonhuman; rhesus monkey; shear stress; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Biomechanics; Biometry; Face; Female; Haplorhini; Male; Mastication; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034788358

The ultimate tensile strength along and across the fibres was ∼-300kNm-2 and ∼-25kNm-2, respectively. The qualitative aspects of fracture were explained on the basis of a uniaxial fibrous composite of strong muscle fibre bundles in a weak connective tissue 'matrix', with poor interfacial strength. Work of fracture through the perimysium was in the range 0·4 to 1·8kJm-2. The difficulty in propagating fracture across the muscle fibre bundles was explained in terms of the material's complete insensitivity to notches running across the fibres.

Such information is important for understanding the functional significance of the mammalian circumorbital region. In this study, bone strain was recorded along the dorsal interorbit, postorbital bar, and mandibular corpus in Otolemur garnettii and O. crassicaudatus (greater galagos) during molar chewing and biting. We determined principal-strain magnitudes and directions, compared peak shear-strain magnitudes between various regions of the face, and compared galago strain patterns with similar experimental data for anthropoids. This suite of analyses were used to test the facial torsion model (Greaves [1985] J Zool (Lond) 207:125-136; [1991] Zool J Linn Soc 101:121-129; [1995] Functional morphology in vertebrate paleontology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p 99-115). A comparison of galago circumorbital and mandibular peak strains during powerful mastication indicates that circumorbital strains are very low in magnitude. This demonstrates that, as in anthropoids, the strepsirhine circumorbital region is highly overbuilt for countering routine masticatory loads. The fact that circumorbital peak-strain magnitudes are uniformly low in both primate suborders undermines any model that emphasizes the importance of masticatory stresses as a determinant of circumorbital form, function, and evolution. Preliminary data also suggest that the difference between mandibular and circumorbital strains is greater in larger-bodied primates. This pattern is interpreted to mean that sufficient cortical bone must exist in the circumorbital region to prevent structural failure due to nonmasticatory traumatic forces. During unilateral mastication, the direction of ε1 at the galago dorsal interorbit indicates the presence of facial torsion combined with bending in the frontal plane. Postorbital bar principal-strain directions during mastication are oriented, on average, very close to 45°relative to the skull's long axis, much as predicted by the facial torsion model. When chewing shifts from one side of the face to the other, there is a characteristic reversal or flip-flop in principal-strain directions for both the interorbit and postorbital bar. Although anthropoids also exhibit an interorbital reversal pattern, peak-strain directions for this clade are opposite those for galagos. The presence of such variation may be due to suborder differences in relative balancing-side jaw-muscle force recruitment. Most importantly, although the strain-direction data for the galago circumorbital region offer support for the occurrence of facial torsion, the low magnitude of these strains suggests that this loading pattern may not be an important determinant of circumorbital morphology.

The degree of integration, measured by the eigenvalue variance of the correlation matrix or by Cheverud's index of integration, varies considerably between races but covaries neither with overall body size nor with the variance of the respective sample. Hence, the degree of morphological integration does not depend on body size or the level of variability The patterns of morphometric correlation are significantly similar among all races, but some minor differences in the patterns could be detected: The similarity between the correlation matrices is independent of the degree of phylogenetic relatedness between the respective races. In all races characters belonin to the same functional and/or developmental unit (leg, wing, abdominal characters) have Eiter correlations than the average. Most of the variation in the pattern of correlation can be expfained as a side effect of variation in the degree of integration. Races with high levels of integration tend to have hiher correlations between the main groups of characters, and races with low levels of integration tave smaller correlations between the main grous of characters, while the basic pattern remains undisturbed. In summary, the comparative analysis of morphometric correlation matrices reveals a picture of stability with respect to the pattern of integration and of variation in the degree of integration, which is random with respect to body size, degree of variability, and phylogeny.

First, we define these properties of variability, how they relate to each other and to variability as a whole. Second, we summarize the common methods of measurement for canalization, developmental stability and morphological integration and the reasoning behind these methods.

Observations that Neanderthals were more heavily muscled, had stronger upper-limb bones, and possessed unusual shapes and orientations of some upper-limb joint complexes relative to the Skhul/Qafzeh hominids, have led some researchers to conclude that significant between-group upper-limb-related behavioral differences must have been present, despite the association of the two groups with similar Middle Paleolithic archeological complexes. A three-dimensional morphometric analysis of the hand remains of the Skhul/Qafzeh hominids, Neanderthals, early and late Upper Paleolithic humans, and Holocene humans supports the dichotomy. The Skhul/Qafzeh carpometacarpal remains do not have any unique morphologies relative to the other fossil samples remains examined. However, in the functionally significant metacarpal 1 and 3 bases they resemble Upper Paleolithic humans, not Neanderthals. Furthermore, the Skhul/Qafzeh sample differs significantly from the Neanderthals in many other aspects of hand functional anatomy. Given the correlations between changes in tool technologies and functional adaptations seen in the hands of Upper Paleolithic humans, it is concluded that the Skhul/Qafzeh hand remains were adapted to Upper Paleolithic-like manipulative repertoires. These results support the inference of significant behavioral differences between Neanderthals and the Skhul/Qafzeh hominids and indicate that a significant shift in human manipulative behaviors was associated with the earliest stages of the emergence of modern humans.",,"archeology; arm; article; behavior; carpometacarpal joint; cultural anthropology; functional anatomy; hand; hominid; human; morphology; morphometrics; paleoanthropology; physical anthropology; priority journal; three dimensional imaging; Hominidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035853150

However, recent investigations suggest the converse ‐ that a remarkable degree of cultural and biological continuity exists among indigenous Nubian groups, perhaps as far back as the Paleolithic. Thus, cultural and biological differences between Nubian populations can be most effectively perceived as the result of in situ evolutionary development. The present analysis has two major purposes: (1) to describe the morphological differences in the craniofacial complex between indigenous Nubian populations extending from the A‐Group (c. 3,400 B.C.) through the Christian (c. 1,500 A.D.) horizons; and (2) to account for these differences within an evolutionary framework. The multiple discriminant analysis of radiographically derived variables revealed a trend from a substantially lower and more elongated cranial vault to a shorter and taller vault throughout the almost 5,000 year time span. Associated with this pattern was a tendency for the face to become more inferiorly‐posteriorly located with respect to the vault in the latter groups. Finally, the masseter and temporalis muscles underwent a reduction and slight relocation through time. We speculate that this trend may be associated with behavioral changes associated with transition from a hunting and gathering to a totally agricultural subsistence pattern.

Thus all cranial development is epigenetic, by definition. Among the numerous epigenetic factors influencing the vertebrate face is mechanical loading Loading seems to be particularly significant for formation and growth of skeletal tissues. As a first approximation, bone grows in the direction of tensile loading, while the shapes of growing cartilages are modulated by axial compression. One of the many sources of loading is function (defined, before birth or hatching, as muscle-controlled movements). For example, muscle activity is a source of tension for bones of attachment, and differences in muscle anatomy may thus be responsible for differences in bony anatomy. A possible instance involves a new addition to the masseter muscle in pigs and an associated unusual process of the zygomatic bone. Changes in the mammalian mandibular condyle in paralyzed fetuses provide a dramatic illustration of how function regulates cartilage growth.

Integration, which is manifested as covariance among structures, enables the skull and associated soft tissues to maintain function both across ontogeny within individuals and across the ranges of size and shape variation among individuals. Integration also contributes to evolvability by structuring the phenotypic expression of genetic variation. We argue that the pattern of covariation seen in complex phenotypes such as the skull results from the overlaying of variation introduced by developmental and environmental factors at different stages of development. Much like a palimpsest, the covariation structure of an adult skull represents the summed imprint of a succession of effects, each of which leaves a distinctive covariation signal determined by the specific set of developmental interactions involved. Covariance evolves either by altering the variance of one of these sequential effects or through the introduction of a novel covariance producing effect. Either way is consistent with the notion that evolutionary change occurs through tinkering. We illustrate these principles through analyses of how genetic perturbations acting at different developmental stages (embryonic, fetal, and postnatal) influence the covariance structure of adult mouse skulls. As predicted by the model, the results illustrate the intimate relationship between the modulation of variance and the expression of covariance. The results also demonstrate that covariance patterns have a complex relationship to the underlying developmental architecture, thus highlighting problems with making inferences about developmental relationships (e.g. modularity) based on covariation.

Despite this interest, the variation in the patterns and processes of skull growth has attracted little attention. An important and unanswered question is the extent to which patterns of cranial covariation and variation are dynamically reworked throughout postnatal growth. To address this question, we examine patterns of variability in random-bred mouse skulls aged 35, 90, and 150 days. Using a battery of both Procrustes coordinate and Euclidean distance-based methods, we measure mean shape, canalization, developmental stability, and morphological integration in these skulls. We predict that the patterns of variability are dynamic, particularly between the youngest and the two oldest age groups due to the influence of functional effects such as postweaning mastication. We also hypothesize that patterns of variability are structured by the same functional and developmental factors that have been shown to influence cranial growth in primates. Our results indicate that contrary to our predictions, patterns of canalization, developmental stability, and morphological integration are stabilized before 35 days. The mean shape, however, changed significantly with growth. We found that only the facial region showed significant integration as predicted by the functional matrix model used in other studies of integration. These results indicate that phenotypic integration in these mice does not closely match those found for primate species, suggesting that comparisons between species should be made with care. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"cranium; growth; ontogeny; phenotype; primate; rodent; age; analysis of variance; animal; article; audiovisual equipment; female; growth, development and aging; image processing; male; mouse; physiology; skull; Age Factors; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Female; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Mice; Models, Anatomic; Skull; Mammalia; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750464209

Experimental studies on a wide variety of mammals, including those with retrognathic postcanine teeth, predict that responses to masticatory loading will be greater in the occlusal plane, the inferior rostrum, and regions associated with the attachments of the temporalis and masseter muscles. Here we test these experimentally-derived predictions on an extinct human population from the middle and upper Ohio valley that underwent a marked shift from hunting-gathering to extensive farming during the last 3,000 years and for which we have good archaeological evidence about diet and food processing technology. Geometric morphometric methods were used to detect and measure the putative effect of diet changes on cranial shape independent of size. Our results partially confirm only some of the experimental predictions. The effect of softer and/or less tough diets on craniofacial shape seem to be concentrated in the relative reduction of the temporal fossa and in a displacement of the attachment of the temporal muscle. However, there were few differences in craniofacial shape in regions closer to the occlusal plane. These results highlight the utility of exploring specific localized morphological shifts using a hierarchical model of craniofacial integration. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric-morphometrics; Masticatory stress; Skull shape; Technological transition; Upper-middle Ohio valley","article; craniofacial morphology; food processing; lifestyle modification; mastication; species extinction; temporalis muscle; United States; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-75149123578

Stained and cleared skeletal preparations and histological sections of the heads of mdg/mdg and normal mouse fetuses were compared in order to determine the effects of the mutation on craniofacial morphology. Muscles of mastication were more severely affected than tongue muscles. Mutant crania had more domed vaults and slender zygomatic arches that were displaced dorsally. The posterior part of the dysgenic mandible was bent dorsally and compressed dorsoventrally. These shape changes may be the distorting effects of persistent cervical kyphosis. Measurements of camera lucida tracings indicated that the lengths of the total mandible, the angular cartilage and process, and the condylar cartilage and process were similar between mutant and control mice. However, the widths of the condylar and angular cartilage were greatly decreased in the mutants. Moreover, the cartilages of dysgenic mice showed no size increase between 18 and 20 days of gestation. The diminished cartilages presumably result from the absence of mechanical loading form prenatal muscle function. For both condylar and angular cartilages, normal muscle activity should produce compression along the long axis of the cartilage and bending/shearing perpendicular to the long axis. It is argued that these forces are more important in promoting growth in cartilage width than length, accounting for the selective reduction of widths in the dysgenic mutant.",,"animal experiment; bone; cartilage; congenital disorder; craniofacial development; craniofacial malformation; etiology; fetus; growth; mandible condyle; mouse; muscle; muscle contraction; muscular dystrophy; normal value; Animal; Cartilage; Face; Female; Male; Masticatory Muscles; Maxillofacial Development; Mice; Muscle Contraction; Muscles; Mutation; Pregnancy; Skull; Stress, Mechanical; Tongue",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019719937

Populations located in the southern portion of this area displayed a hunter-gatherer subsistence economy up to historical times, and coexisted with farmers located to the north. Archaeological and biological evidence suggests that the transition to food production was associated with the consumption of a softer diet and a more sedentary way of life. This study tests the hypothesis that diet-related factors influenced morphological differentiation, by comparing functional cranial components of farmers and hunter-gatherers. Three-dimensional changes on eight minor functional components (anteroneural, midneural, posteroneural, otic, optic, respiratory, masticatory, and alveolar) were measured on skulls derived from both subareas. Volumetric and morphometric indices were calculated to estimate the absolute and relative size of components, respectively. Results of a paired t-test indicated that farmers have a smaller craniofacial size than hunter-gatherers. The components that varied the most were masticatory and posteroneural, showing smaller absolute and relative sizes in farmers. Discriminant analyses indicated that lengths and widths were the most affected dimensions of these and other components. The pattern of differentiation, which involves specific components, enabled us to exclude differential gene flow and stochastic mechanisms as the main causes. Instead, results support the hypothesis that diet-related factors associated with both subsistence economies influenced craniofacial morphology. A proportion of the observed variation associated with size differences can be explained by two systemic factors: the lesser quality of nutrition due to a low protein content in the diet, and a decrease of growth hormone circulation induced by a lower mobility due to sedentism. However, differentiation is better explained by a localized factor: the reduction in the masticatory and posteroneural components in farmers resulted from a decrease of masticatory stresses and workload on the head and neck, linked to the consumption of a softer diet. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Functional cranial components; Masticatory stress; Subsistence economy","adult; agricultural worker; animal hunting; Argentina; article; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; diet; evolution; female; food intake; human; male; measurement; sex difference; skull; Adult; Agriculture; Argentina; Cephalometry; Diet; Evolution; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Mandible; Maxillofacial Development; Neck Muscles; Sex Factors; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744956545

Under these conditions, the interaction among those processes may produce a dynamic structure of integration even when the level of variability is constant. To determine whether the constancy of variance in skull shape throughout most of postnatal growth results from a balance between processes generating and removing variation, we compare covariance structures from age to age in two rodent species, cotton rats (Sigmodon fulviventer) and house mice (Mus musculus domesticus). We assess the overall similarity of covariance matrices by the matrix correlation, and compare the structures of covariance matrices using common subspace analysis, a method related to common principal components (PCs) analysis but suited to cases in which variation is so nearly spherical that PCs are ambiguous. We find significant differences from age to age in covariance structure and the more effectively canalized ones tend to be least stable in covariance structure. We find no evidence that canalization gradually and preferentially removes deviations arising early in development as we might expect if canalization results from compensatory differential growth. Our results suggest that (co)variation patterns are continually restructured by processes that equilibrate variance, and thus that canalization plays a critical role in molding patterns of integration. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"morphology; animal; article; comparative anatomy; growth, development and aging; histology; morphogenesis; mouse; principal component analysis; Sigmodontinae; skull; Anatomy, Comparative; Animals; Mice; Morphogenesis; Principal Component Analysis; Sigmodontinae; Skull; Gossypium hirsutum; Mus musculus; Mus musculus domesticus; Rodentia; Sigmodon; Sigmodon fulviventer",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645029220

A major limitation of previous studies is large temporal gaps between the analyzed skeletal populations, which do not allow the detection and analysis of a diachronic morphological transition. In this work, we analyze a large number of specimens from the southern Levant, where agriculture first emerged in situ and for which there is a good diachronic sequence of the shift from a hunting-gathering way of life to a food producing, farming economy (12,000-7,000 uncalibrated bp). Changes in the masticatory complex are examined in the context of three prevailing dental reduction models: the Probable Mutation Effect (Brace, 1963; Brace and Mahler, 1971), Increasing Population Density Effect (Macchiarelli and Bondioli, 1986) and Selective Compromise Effect (SCE) (Calcagno, 1989). A series of linear regressions of dimension vs. time and coefficients of variation for each dimension are analyzed. Our results indicate significant reduction in the buccolingual but not mesiodistal dental dimensions and in the ramus breadth and anterior height dimensions of the mandible but not in its overall size. These findings, taken together with low coefficients of variation for the buccolingual dimensions, suggest selective pressure resulting in reduction of specific dimensions. The observed trend is in partial accordance with the SCE but differs from the trends observed in other regions, and is therefore best explained as a region-specific variant of the SCE. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Dental crown reduction; Levant; Selective pressures; Transition to agriculture","agricultural worker; animal hunting; article; craniofacial morphology; economic aspect; evolution; food industry; geological time; human; lifestyle; linear regression analysis; mastication; morphology; Pleistocene; population density; tooth crown; Agriculture; Ancient Lands; Anthropology, Physical; Diet; Evolution; History, Ancient; Humans; Mastication; Paleodontology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349120723

In those craniosynostosis syndromes caused by FGFR1-3 mutations, alteration of signaling in the FGF/FGFR system leads to dysmorphology of the skull, brain and limbs, among other organs. Since this molecular pathway is widely expressed throughout head development, we explore whether and how two specific mutations on Fgfr2 causing Apert syndrome in humans affect the pattern and level of integration between the facial skeleton and the neurocranium using inbred Apert syndrome mouse models Fgfr2+/S252W and Fgfr2+/P253R and their non-mutant littermates at P0. Skull morphological integration (MI), which can reflect developmental interactions among traits by measuring the intensity of statistical associations among them, was assessed using data from microCT images of the skull of Apert syndrome mouse models and 3D geometric morphometric methods. Our results show that mutant Apert syndrome mice share the general pattern of MI with their non-mutant littermates, but the magnitude of integration between and within the facial skeleton and the neurocranium is increased, especially in Fgfr2+/S252W mice. This indicates that although Fgfr2 mutations do not disrupt skull MI, FGF/FGFR signaling is a covariance-generating process in skull development that acts as a global factor modulating the intensity of MI.

The inclusion of distinct infraorbital configurations, such as the ""canine fossa"" in Homo sapiens or the ""inflated"" maxilla in Neandertals, is generally based on either descriptive or qualitative assessments of this morphology, or simple linear chord and subtense measurements. However, the complex curvilinear surface of the infraorbital region has proven difficult to quantify through these traditional methods. In this study, we assess infraorbital shape and its potential allometric scaling in fossil Homo (n = 18) and recent humans (n = 110) with a geometric morphometric method well-suited for quantifying complex surface topographies. Our results indicate that important aspects of infraorbital shape are correlated with overall infraorbital size across Homo. Specifically, individuals with larger infraorbital areas tend to exhibit relatively flatter infraorbital surface topographies, taller and narrower infraorbital areas, sloped inferior orbital rims, anteroinferiorly oriented maxillary body facies, posteroinferiorly oriented maxillary processes of the zygomatic, and non-everted lateral nasal margins. In contrast, individuals with smaller infraorbital regions generally exhibit relatively depressed surface topographies, shorter and wider infraorbital areas, projecting inferior orbital rims, posteroinferiorly oriented maxillary body facies, anteroinferiorly oriented maxillary processes, and everted lateral nasal margins. These contrasts form a continuum and only appear dichotomized at the ends of the infraorbital size spectrum. In light of these results, we question the utility of incorporating traditionally polarized infraorbital morphologies in phylogenetic and functional analyses without due consideration of continuous infraorbital and facial size variation in Homo. We conclude that the essentially flat infraorbital surface topography of Neandertals is not unique and can be explained, in part, as a function of possessing large infraorbital regions, the ancestral condition for Homo. Furthermore, it appears likely that the diminutive infraorbital region of anatomically modern Homo sapiens is a primary derived trait, with related features such as depressed infraorbital surface topography expressed as correlated secondary characters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A generalized trend of reduction of temporomandibular joint size was observed. In addition, a decrease in sexual dimorphism was apparent for all measures of joint size; a change primarily mitigated by reductions in male dimensions. The observed variation in size and form of the temporomandibular joint is most likely the result of the reduction in masticatory muscle robusticity and resultant changes in craniofacial form which have been documented for the transition from a hunting and gathering to an agricultural subsistence in Nubia.

Variations in this trait derive from multiple and complex interactions between portions of the brain and the size and shape of the cranial base, among other factors. Given their evolutionary and functional importance, neurocranial globularity is expected to present high genetic and developmental constraints on their phenotypic expression. Here we applied two independent approaches to investigate both types of constraints. First, we assessed if patterns of morphological integration are conserved or else disrupted on a series of artificially deformed skulls in comparison to nondeformed (ND) ones. Second, after the estimation of the genetic covariance matrix for human skull shape, we explored how neurocranial globularity would respond to putative selective events disrupting the normal morphological patterns. Simulations on these deviations were explicitly set to replicate the artificial deformation patterns in order to compare developmental and genetic constraints under the same biomechanical conditions. In general terms, our results indicate that putative developmental constraints help to preserve some aspects of normal morphological integration even in the deformed skulls. Moreover, we find that the response to selection in neurocranial globularity is pervasive. In other words, induced changes in the vault generate a global response, indicating that departures from normal patterns of neurocranial globularity are genetically constrained. In summary, our combined results suggest that neurocranial globularity behaves as a highly genetic and developmental constrained trait. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Artificial deformation; Constraints; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological integration; Neurocranial globularity; Quantitative genetics",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-69849101823

These comparisons demonstrate that Neanderthal hand morphologies are at or beyond the range of recent human samples for traits such as: expanded distal tuberosities, rugose musculotendinous attachment sites, dorsopalmarly flat metacarpal 1 bases, relatively short thumb proximal phalanges, more parasagittally oriented capitate metacarpal 2 facets, reduced metacarpal 3 styloid processes, radioulnarly flat metacarpal 5 bases, and large, projecting carpal tubercles. Functional interpretations suggest that Neanderthal hands are adapted primarily for power during manipulation. Neanderthal hands are rarely systematically compared to those of other Late Pleistocene humans. Metric and three-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses and qualitative observations demonstrate that Early and Late Upper Paleolithic hand remains are more similar to recent human hands than to Neanderthal hands and that the Skhul/Qafzeh sample is similar to the Upper Paleolithic samples. However, Early and Late Upper Paleolithic hand remains are not indistinguishable from those of modern humans. Evident in the Early Upper Paleolithic sample are features reminiscent of Neanderthals, such as the presence (on some specimens) of significant muscle crests on metacarpals 1 and 5 as well as a Neanderthal-like metacarpal 1 base shape. Additionally, both the Early and Late Upper Paleolithic samples have intermediate metacarpal 2 and 3 base morphologies relative to Neanderthal and recent human samples. There are indications of increased stabilization of the mid-carpometacarpal region, the enhancement of first finger precision movements, and reductions in mechanical advantages in the Early and Late Upper Paleolithic specimens. Some features found in the Upper Paleolithic samples are likely related to increases in the frequency and sophistication of hafted tools, while functional adaptations related to more frequent precision grip usage are argued to be associated with fine finger movements. © 2008 Springer.","Carpometacarpal articulations; Geometric morphometrics; Hands; Neanderthal; Upper Paleolithic",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045089423

Several tools have been developed using different osseous structures. With the intention to provide an objective method comparison, we reported the analysis of three different methods (visual, metric and geometric morphometrics) for sex assessment of the greater sciatic notch. One hundred and thirty pelvic bones (45.4% females and 54.6% males) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico Skeletal Collection pertaining to the contemporary Mexican population were analyzed.We used the ROC-analysis to test between desired false positive thresholds (1-specificity) and expected true positive rates (sensitivity) in order to predict the best approach to sex assessment. The comparison of the area under the ROC-curves shows significant differences among visual and metric methods. At the same time, the analysis suggested that higher morphological variation among the sexes is independent of the methodological approach.The results indicate that the metric (angle), with a high percent of indeterminate cases (34.6%), and visual, with 26.2% of the cases allocated as intermediate cases, were poorly accurate; we cannot recommend these techniques for sexing an unknown specimen. On the other hand, the geometric morphometrics approach improves sex estimation in 82.3% of correctly classified individuals with more than 95% of posterior probability.In addition to the method comparison, the major sexual variation of the greater sciatic notch was determined to be located on its posterior border. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Forensic anthropology population data; Forensic osteology; Geometric morphometrics; Greater sciatic notch; Sex diagnosis","accuracy; adult; aged; angular morphometrics; area under the curve; article; false positive result; female; forensic identification; geometric morphometrics; Hispanic; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; male; methodology; morphometrics; pelvic girdle; physical anthropology; prediction; priority journal; probability; receiver operating characteristic; sciatic notch; sensitivity and specificity; sex determination; sex difference; visual morphometrics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864326754

The study of variability at the phenotypic level is concerned with how the architecture of development structures the translation of genetic variation and environmental effects into phenotypic variation. This is important because natural selection acts on phenotypes, but the results are interpreted and transmitted from generation to generation at the genetic level. It is interesting precisely because the relationship between variation at the genetic level and variation at the phenotypic level can be very complex. If the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation were straightforward, the study of development would be largely irrelevant to evolutionary biology. Getting at the developmental genetic basis for variability is different from the developmental genetic basis of phenotypic variation in specific developmental contexts. The study of the evolutionary developmental biology of variation is still at a very early stage, but its conceptual framework is well developed. The study of the developmental basis for phenotypic variability addresses a higher level of abstraction in that it deals with the tendency of developmental systems to change, amplify, or reduce the expression of genetic variation at the phenotypic level. This area of study is difficult because variability arises from emergent properties of complex developmental systems. Understanding how variability arises from developmental systems requires approaches that focus on the patterns and nature of the interactions among elements in the system. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

These cultural practices act in combination with geographical and linguistic barriers and can promote faster evolutionary changes shaped by gene-culture interactions. However, specific cases indicative of this interaction are scarce. Here we show that quantitative genetic parameters obtained from cephalometric data taken on 1,203 individuals analyzed in combination with genetic, climatic, social, and life-history data belonging to six South Amerindian populations are compatible with a scenario of rapid genetic and phenotypic evolution, probably mediated by cultural shifts. We found that the Xavánte experienced a remarkable pace of evolution: the rate of morphological change is far greater than expected for its time of split from their sister group, the Kayapó, which occurred around 1,500 y ago. We also suggest that this rapid differentiation was possible because of strong social- organization differences. Our results demonstrate how human groups deriving from a recent common ancestor can experience variable paces of phenotypic divergence, probably as a response to different cultural or social determinants. We suggest that assembling composite databases involving cultural and biological data will be of key importance to unravel cases of evolution modulated by the cultural environment.","Amerindians; Cultural evolution; Morphology; mtDNA; Multiple factor analysis","American Indian; article; cephalometry; climate change; cultural factor; ethnic group; evolution; female; genetic distance; genetic variability; head circumference; human; life history; male; phenotypic variation; population genetic structure; priority journal; quantitative genetics; social structure; Biological Evolution; Cultural Diversity; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ethnic Groups; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856020368

Brown 2915, U9120ACD, Puerto Madryn, Argentina","Objectives: The head can be used as a model to study complex phenotypes controlled simultaneously by morphological integration (MI) due to common factors, and modular patterns caused by local factors affecting the development and functional demands of specific structures. The fibroblast growth factor and receptor system (FGF/FGFR) participates in cell communication and pattern formation in osseous tissues, among others, and there is compelling evidence from mouse model studies suggesting a role of the FGF/FGFR pathway as a covariance-generating signaling process in head development. Here we use human data to test if specific genetic variants of another gene of this pathway, the FGFR1 gene, can be associated with differences in the integration of the head. Methods: We explored whether and how three specific variants on FGFR1, previously associated with human cephalic index, influence the pattern and level of head integration of one Native American and one admixed group from Mexico. MI, measured as the intensity of covariation among head traits, was assessed using data from three-dimensional head landmark coordinates taken on 176 individuals. Results: Individuals carrying the derived allele of the rs4647905:G>C polymorphism present significantly greater levels of head MI, especially in facial structures and on the shape space where the modular portion of the covariation is explicitly removed. Conclusions: Since FGFR genes present nonconservative and tissue-specific splicing sites, they may have some effect on protein structure and performance likely involved in developmental processes responsible for the magnitude and pattern of MI in the human head.

Regardless of bones examined, anthropologists know of some of the complexities surrounding muscle marker development. Here, posterior cranial muscle markers are analyzed to determine whether they are useful in reconstructing activities by examining effects that may hinder reconstructions. Additionally, upper limb muscle markers and humeral cross-sectional robusticity variables are correlated with cranial muscle markers to determine if robust individuals are generally robust due to the synergistic effects of muscle use. Cranial muscle markers of 65 prehistoric California Amerinds are scored using a five-point observer rating scale. Body mass is calculated from femoral head size; maximum cranial length and breadth are measured with a spreading caliper; and age and sex are determined through standard procedures. Upper limb muscle markers are scored on seven sites using two dimensions within a seven-point scale. Cross-sectional properties are calculated from biplanar humeral radiographs. Aggregates are created for cranial muscle markers, upper limb muscle markers, and cross-sectional robusticity. Cranial muscle markers correlate significantly with cranial length, r=0.25 and cross-sectional robusticity of humerus, r=0.29; P's<0.05. All variables differed between sexes (Mann-Whitney=31.00-307.50, P's<0.01). Results imply that some differences in cranial muscle markers are related to size; however, individuals with well-developed cranial muscle markers have greater upper limb robusticity possibly due to activity patterns. Sex differences remained after size controls and may relate to activity differences. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.
