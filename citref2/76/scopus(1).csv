Despite decades of research, no consensus has emerged about the extent of admixture between the indigenous and exotic populations or the degree to which the appearance of specific components of the ""Neolithic cultural package"" in Europe reflects truly independent development. Here, through the use of mitochondrial DNA from 323 modern and 221 ancient pig specimens sampled across western Eurasia, we demonstrate that domestic pigs of Near Eastern ancestry were definitely introduced into Europe during the Neolithic (potentially along two separate routes), reaching the Paris Basin by at least the early 4th millennium B.C. Local European wild boar were also domesticated by this time, possibly as a direct consequence of the introduction of Near Eastern domestic pigs. Once domesticated, European pigs rapidly replaced the introduced domestic pigs of Near Eastern origin throughout Europe. Domestic pigs formed a key component of the Neolithic Revolution, and this detailed genetic record of their origins reveals a complex set of interactions and processes during the spread of early farmers into Europe. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","European colonization; mtDNA; Phylogeography","mitochondrial DNA; article; DNA determination; domestic pig; domestication; Europe; evolution; human; migration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; phylogeography; priority journal; swine; unindexed sequence; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34848916115

The effects of captivity on the behaviour of wild and domestic animals have been relatively well studied, but little has been published on morphological changes in wild animals in captivity. We review the evidence for changes in a wide variety of mammalian taxa, with non-mammalian examples where relevant. 2. We consider the morphological effects of the process of domestication, and compare changes in both hard and soft tissues in captive and domestic animals with those in their wild counterparts. These include skull shape differences, brain size reduction, postcranial adaptations and digestive tract changes. 3. We also summarize studies that have looked at morphological change in feral animals in comparison with their wild and domestic ancestors, and consider their use as an analogue for morphological change in captive-bred animals that have been released into the wild. 4. We then discuss the importance of this work for the wider aims of conservation of endangered species and captive breeding over many generations, and emphasize the importance of studying these changes now, while for many species, the process is just beginning rather than many generations down the line, or immediately prior to release, where survival of captive-bred animals may be severely compromised. © 2005 Mammal Society.","Captive breeding; Domestication; Feral; Morphological change; Phenotypic plasticity; Reintroduction","captivity; domestication; feral organism; mammal; morphology; Animalia; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744803475

They then spread across the Middle and Near East and westward into Europe alongside early agriculturalists. European pigs were either domesticated independently or more likely appeared so as a result of admixture between introduced pigs and European wild boar. As a result, European wild boar mtDNA lineages replaced Near Eastern/Anatolian mtDNA signatures in Europe and subsequently replaced indigenous domestic pig lineages in Anatolia. The specific details of these processes, however, remain unknown. To address questions related to early pig domestication, dispersal, and turnover in the Near East, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA and dental geometric morphometric variation in 393 ancient pig specimens representing 48 archeological sites (from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic to the Medieval period) from Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Our results reveal the first genetic signatures of early domestic pigs in the Near Eastern Neolithic core zone. We also demonstrate that these early pigs differed genetically from those in western Anatolia that were introduced to Europe during the Neolithic expansion. In addition, we present a significantly more refined chronology for the introduction of European domestic pigs into Asia Minor that took place during the Bronze Age, at least 900 years earlier than previously detected. By the 5th century AD, European signatures completely replaced the endemic lineages possibly coinciding with the widespread demographic and societal changes that occurred during the Anatolian Bronze and Iron Ages. © 2012 The Author 2012.

Despite its importance and the decades of research devoted to studying it, questions regarding the origins and processes of domestication remain. Here, we review recent theoretical advances and present a perspective that underscores the crucial role that population admixture has played in influencing the genomes of domestic animals over the past 10. 000 years. We then discuss novel approaches to generating and analysing genetic data, emphasising the importance of an explicit hypothesis-testing approach for the inference of the origins and subsequent evolution and demography of domestic animals.

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

Using molar shape geometric morphometric analysis, archaeological Sus dental series from the Sarawak caves of Niah (Aceramic, Neolithic) and Lobang Kudih (Ming period), are compared with extant ISEA wild pigs to establish their taxonomic status and to further explore the evidence for local domestication or introduction of allochthonous populations. Results on modern data-sets show that outline analysis of the third lower molar achieves highly significant inter- and intra-specific differentiation among ISEA wild pigs, with a phenotypic divergence structure displaying congruence with molecular phylogenies. Both tooth shape and mtDNA evidence strongly suggest the so-called wild pigs of New Guinea to be the descendants of pigs domesticated in mainland South East Asia and introduced by early farmers to ISEA. None of our data provide clear evidence for a Neolithic introduction of domesticated pigs, or for the local domestication of indigenous bearded pigs, since all Aceramic and Neolithic pigs from Niah cave have been identified as indigenous bearded pig (Sus barbatus). Local domestication experiments by foragers have not been ruled out, since evidence of hypoplasia as a marker of domestication processes has been observed. Introduction of allochthonous domestic pigs between the Late Neolithic and the Metal Age is suggested, since this small domestic breed from Lobang Kudih cave displays strong phenetic relationships with S. scrofa of New Guinea, recognised by molecular phylogeography as part of the 'Pacific Clade' linked both with Lapita and Polynesian dispersals. Introduction of celebensis-like species has also been suggested. Future studies should incorporate broader time-scale and geographical framework data-sets to strengthen these assumptions.

Metrical methods are the most commonly used; these are reviewed. Assemblages containing a wider range of measurements (as measured by the coefficient of variation [V]) than is found in one population suggest that two populations of different-sized pigs were present, probably indicating separate wild and domestic populations with little or no interbreeding. These assemblages, sometimes taken to indicate animals 'intermediate' between wild and domestic, are clear evidence of full domestication. Other traditional means of diagnosing domestication based on age at death (the killing of many young animals) and biogeography (the export of the animal beyond its natural range, especially to islands) are particularly problematic when applied to pigs. New methods include the frequency of Linear Enamel Hypoplasia, which may increase due to domestication-induced stress, the study of diet through isotopes and dental microwear, and the examination of population histories through ancient and modern DNA and geometric morphometrics. These are all promising but should not be considered in isolation: many problems remain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Domestic pig; Domestication; Methods; Old World; Wild boar","archaeological evidence; diet; DNA; domestication; historical perspective; isolation effect; morphometry; pig; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858599203

It is shown that not only the size, but also the shape of teeth and mandibles can help in highlighting patterns of variability in wild boar from different areas. A number of geographic trends are identified in the variation of S. scrofa across its range, mainly concerning the differentiation of insular forms, and the existence of South-North and West-East clines. Other factors such as hybridisation with domestic stock, feralisation and human-induced movement of animals may also play an important role. A comparison with ancient material emphasises the existence of similarities as well as differences between modern and ancient populations.

Based on a set of 52 present-day pollen assemblages (mostly moss polsters) from continental France and black- and-white aerial photographs of these localities, we perform statistical analyses to clarify the meaning of the AP/NAP ratio. Short- and long-distance transported pollen grains, possible over-representation of Pinus, and distortion of cultivated plants are among the biases explored here and for which answers are given. Grey level analysis of the aerial photographs provides direct estimates of the Tree Surface/Herb Surface (TS/HS) ratio for a radius of 1000 m around the sampling point. Statistical estimates of the AP/NAP and TS/HS cut-off values separating tree- and herb-prevalent landscapes are computed. Such results obtained from modern pollen records have been applied to a Late Pliocene small maar locality from southern France characterized by a very weak pollen transport and provide the basis to further distinguish tree- and herb-prevalent landscapes in past pollen records. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
