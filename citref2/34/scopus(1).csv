The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.",,"animal; article; biological model; biometry; evolution; frog; genetics; phylogeny; Animals; Biometry; Evolution; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Ranidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023375195

For interpolation of a surface over a fixed set of nodes in the plane, the bending energy is a quadratic form in the heights assigned to the surface. The spline is the superposition of eigenvectors of the bending energy matrix, of successively larger physical scales, over a tilted flat plane having no bending energy at all. When these splines are paired, one representing the x-coordinate of another form and the other the y-coordinate, they aid greatly in the modeling of biological shape change as deformation. In this context, the pair becomes an interpolation map from R2 to R2 relating two sets of landmark points. The spline maps decompose, in the same way as the spline surfaces, into a linear part (an affine transformation) together with the superposition of principal warps, which are geometrically independent, affine-free deformations of progressively smaller geometrical scales. The warps decompose an empirical deformation into orthogonal features more or less as a conventional orthogonal functional analysis decomposes the single scene. This paper demonstrates the decomposition of deformations by principal warps, extends the method to deal with curving edges between landmarks, relates this formalism to other applications of splines current in computer vision, and indicates how they might aid in the extraction of features for analysis, comparison, and diagnosis of biological and medical images. © 1989 IEEE","Affine transformations; biharmonic equation; biomedical image analysis; deformation; principal warps; quadratic variation; shape; thin-plate splines; warping",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957563017

Although orbitally induced changes in the monsoon strength account for a large part of long-term climatic changes in tropical Africa, the Late Pleistocene-Holocene hydrological fluctuations rather appear to have been a series of abrupt events that reflect complex interactions between orbital forcing, atmosphere, ocean and land surface conditions. During the Last Glacial Maximum (23-18 ka BP), most records indicate that generally dry conditions have prevailed in both hemispheres, associated with lower tropical land- and sea-surface temperatures. This agrees with simulations using coupled ocean-atmosphere models, which predict cooling and reduced summer precipitation in tropical Africa; the global hydrological cycle was weaker than today when the extent of large polar ice-sheets and sea-ice was a prominent forcing factor of the Earth's climate. Glacial-interglacial climatic changes started early: a first wetting/warming phase at ca. 17-16 ka BP took place during a period of rapid temperature increase in Antarctica. Next, two drastic arid-humid transitions in equatorial and northern Africa occurred around 15-14.5 ka BP and 11.5-11 ka BP. Both are thought to match the major Greenland warming events, in concert with the switching of the oceanic thermohaline circulation to modern mode. However, part of the climatic signal after 15 ka BP also seems related to the Antarctica climate. During the Holocene, Africa has also experienced rapid hydrological fluctuations of dramatic magnitude compared to the climatic changes at high latitudes. In particular, major dry spells occurred around 8.4-8 ka and 4.2-4 ka BP in the northern monsoon domain. Comparison with other parts of the world indicates that these events have a worldwide distribution but different regional expressions. In the absence of large polar ice sheets, changes in the continental hydrological cycles in the tropics may have a significant impact on the global climate system. Climate information gathered here allows to identify geographical and methodological gaps, and raise some scientific questions that remain to be solved to better understand how the tropics respond to changes in major climate-forcing factors, and how they influence climate globally.",,"hydrological response; Last Glacial Maximum; paleohydrology; tropical environment; Africa",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033979952

The terrigenous record exhibits a well-defined period of low influx between 14.8 and 5.5 cal. ka BP associated with the African Humid Period, when the Sahara was nearly completely vegetated and supported numerous perennial lakes; an arid interval corresponding to the Younger Dryas Chronozone punctuates this humid period. The African Humid Period has been attributed to a strengthening of the African monsoon due to gradual orbital increases in summer season insolation. However, the onset and termination of this humid period were very abrupt, occurring within decades to centuries. Both transitions occurred when summer season insolation crossed a nearly identical threshold value; which was 4.2% greater than present. These abrupt climate responses to gradual insolation forcing require strongly non-linear feedback processes, and current coupled climate model studies invoke vegetation and ocean temperature feedbacks as candidate mechanisms for the non-linear climate sensitivity. The African monsoon climate system is thus a low-latitude corollary to the bi-stable behavior of high-latitude deep ocean thermohaline circulation, which is similarly capable of rapid and large-amplitude climate transitions.",,"climate change; climate forcing; monsoon; paleoclimate; Africa",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033957744

We studied 121 African populations, four African American populations, and 60 non-African populations for patterns of variation at 1327 nuclear microsatellite and insertion/deletion markers. We identified 14 ancestral population clusters in Africa that correlate with self-described ethnicity and shared cultural and/or linguistic properties. We observed high levels of mixed ancestry in most populations, reflecting historical migration events across the continent. Our data also provide evidence for shared ancestry among geographically diverse hunter-gatherer populations (Khoesan speakers and Pygmies). The ancestry of African Americans is predominantly from Niger-Kordofanian (∼71%), European (∼13%), and other African (∼8%) populations, although admixture levels varied considerably among individuals. This study helps tease apart the complex evolutionary history of Africans and African Americans, aiding both anthropological and genetic epidemiologic studies.",,"ancestry; genetic structure; genetic variation; geographical distribution; history; migration; Africa; African American; article; cultural anthropology; ethnicity; gene identification; genetic epidemiology; genetic risk; genetic variability; geographic distribution; history; human; indel mutation; language ability; microsatellite marker; migration; plesiomorphy; priority journal; Africa; African Americans; African Continental Ancestry Group; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; Continental Population Groups; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Geography; Humans; INDEL Mutation; Language; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; Africa; East Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-66249116333

Previously it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R. phangorn, now offers the possibility of reconstructing phylogenies with distance based methods, maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation. Extending the general ML framework, this package provides the possibility of estimating mixture and partition models. Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing trees, phylogenetic models or splits, simulating character data and performing congruence analyses. © The Author(s) 2010.

Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

A key barrier to the resolution of these questions has been the lack of substantial and accurately dated African hominid fossils from between 100,000 and 300,000 years ago. Here we describe fossilized hominid crania from Herto, Middle Awash, Ethiopia, that fill this gap and provide crucial evidence on the location, timing and contextual circumstances of the emergence of Homo sapiens. Radioisotopically dated to between 160,000 and 154,000 years ago, these new fossils predate classic Neanderthals and lack their derived features. The Herto hominids are morphologically and chronologically intermediate between archaic African fossils and later anatomically modern Late Pleistocene humans. They therefore represent the probable immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans. Their anatomy and antiquity constitute strong evidence of modern-human emergence in Africa.",,"Biology; Human engineering; Morphology; Radioisotopes; Homo sapiens; Geochronology; cranium; evolution; fossil; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; Africa; article; chronology; Ethiopia; fossil; hominid; human; morphology; pleistocene; priority journal; skull; Adult; Animals; Child; Ethiopia; Evolution; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Male; Skull; Ethiopia; Crania; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037564967

These genomes include at least 5.8 million base pairs that are not present in the human reference genome. Our analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human genome variation, including that the rate of accumulation of mutations has accelerated by about 5% in non-Africans compared to Africans since divergence. We show that the ancestors of some pairs of present-day human populations were substantially separated by 100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans; instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming from the same source as that of other non-Africans. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"ancestry; data set; divergence; genetic variation; genome; indigenous population; minority group; mutation; African; Andamanese; Article; ethnic group; gene mutation; genetic variability; genome; human; Indigenous Australian; Papua New Guinean; population dispersal; priority journal; ancestry group; animal; Australia; Black person; DNA sequence; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; history; Homo neanderthalensis; human genome; information processing; migration; mutation rate; Oceanic ancestry group; Papua New Guinea; phylogeny; population genetics; species difference; time factor; Africa; Andamans; Andamans and Nicobars; Australia; New Guinea; African Continental Ancestry Group; Animals; Australia; Continental Population Groups; Datasets as Topic; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Genomics; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Mutation Rate; Neanderthals; New Guinea; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Time Factors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991728057

Not all would agree, but evidence for a single recent origin is accumulating. Here, we want to go beyond this debate and explore within the “Out of Africa” framework an issue that has not been fully addressed: the mechanism by which modern human diversity has developed. We believe there is no clear rubicon of modern Homo sapiens, and that multiple dispersals occurred from a morphologically variable population in Africa. Pre‐existing African diversity is thus crucial to the way human diversity developed outside Africa. The pattern of diversity—behavioural, linguistic, morphological and genetic—can be interpreted as the result of dispersals, colonisation, differentiation and subsequent dispersals overlaid on former population ranges. The first dispersals would have originated in Africa from where two different geographical routes were possible, one through Ethiopia/Arabia towards South Asia, and one through North Africa/Middle East towards Eurasia.

However, this is where the near consensus on human settlement history ends, and considerable uncertainty clouds any more detailed aspect of human colonization history. Here, we present a dynamic genetic model of human settlement history coupled with explicit geographical distances from East Africa, the likely origin of modern humans. We search for the best-supported parameter space by fitting our analytical prediction to genetic data that are based on 52 human populations analyzed at 783 autosomal microsatellite markers. This framework allows us to jointly estimate the key parameters of the expansion of modern humans. Our best estimates suggest an initial expansion of modern humans ∼56,000 years ago from a small founding population of ∼1,000 effective individuals. Our model further points to high growth rates in newly colonized habitats. The general fit of the model with the data is excellent. This suggests that coupling analytical genetic models with explicit demography and geography provides a powerful tool for making inferences on human-settlement history. © 2006 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

However, the exact place and time of emergence of H. sapiens remain obscure because the fossil record is scarce and the chronological age of many key specimens remains uncertain. In particular, it is unclear whether the present day 'modern' morphology rapidly emerged approximately 200 thousand years ago (ka) among earlier representatives of H. sapiens1 or evolved gradually over the last 400 thousand years2. Here we report newly discovered human fossils from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, and interpret the affinities of the hominins from this site with other archaic and recent human groups. We identified a mosaic of features including facial, mandibular and dental morphology that aligns the Jebel Irhoud material with early or recent anatomically modern humans and more primitive neurocranial and endocranial morphology. In combination with an age of 315 ± 34 thousand years (as determined by thermoluminescence dating)3, this evidence makes Jebel Irhoud the oldest and richest African Middle Stone Age hominin site that documents early stages of the H. sapiens clade in which key features of modern morphology were established. Furthermore, it shows that the evolutionary processes behind the emergence of H. sapiens involved the whole African continent. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"biochronology; emergence; evolutionary biology; fossil; hominid; Mesolithic; morphology; new record; Pan African orogeny; thermoluminescence; Article; controlled study; fossil; Homo neanderthalensis; human; Mesolithic; Middle Pleistocene; Morocco; priority journal; thermoluminescence; tooth development; Africa; anatomy and histology; animal; chronology; classification; ethnology; face; hominid; mandible; phylogeny; skull; tooth; Morocco; Homo sapiens; Africa; Animals; Chronology as Topic; Face; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Mandible; Morocco; Phylogeny; Skull; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020446161

Some cranial regions, particularly the face and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because different cranial regions preserve population history and climate signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate adaptation; Craniofacial morphology; Human variation; Neutral genetics; Population history","accuracy; article; climate; correlation analysis; evolution; face; female; genetic distance; geometry; history; human; human tissue; hypothesis; male; morphology; morphometrics; normal human; phylogeny; population research; priority journal; reliability; skull; temporal bone; Acclimatization; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Climate; Continental Population Groups; Evolution; Face; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Temporal Bone; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845396793

We show that Paleo-Eskimos (∼3000 BCE to 1300 CE) represent a migration pulse into the Americas independent of both Native American and Inuit expansions. Furthermore, the genetic continuity characterizing the Paleo-Eskimo period was interrupted by the arrival of a new population, representing the ancestors of present-day Inuit, with evidence of past gene flow between these lineages. Despite periodic abandonment of major Arctic regions, a single Paleo-Eskimo metapopulation likely survived in near-isolation for more than 4000 years, only to vanish around 700 years ago.",,"mitochondrial DNA; Arctic; article; bone; Canada; ethnology; genetics; Greenland; hair; history; human; human genome; Inuit; migration; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; Russian Federation; survivor; tooth; United States; Alaska; Arctic Regions; Base Sequence; Bone and Bones; Canada; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genome, Human; Greenland; Hair; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Inuits; Molecular Sequence Data; Siberia; Survivors; Tooth",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907279761

Previous apportionments of craniometric diversity are similar to these genetic apportionments, implying that interregionally differing selection pressures have played a limited role in producing contemporary human cranial diversity. Here we show that when cranial variation is independently partitioned using principal components analysis of Mosimann shape variables, some estimates of interregional craniometric differentiation are larger than those for most genetic loci. These estimates are similar to estimates for genetic loci where interregionally differing selection pressures are implicated in producing the observed patterns of variation within and among regions. These results suggest that differences among regions in at least some cranial features, particularly in the nasal region, are in part the product of interregionally differing selection pressures. Moreover, these results have implications for assessing the biological affinities of prehistoric samples that are temporally separated from contemporary human reference populations. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","FST; Human diversification; Principal components; Race; Regional continuity; Shape","article; craniometry; gene locus; genetic drift; genetic model; genetic variability; human; human tissue; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; quantitative genetics; race difference; sampling; Cephalometry; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Skull; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-5444225001

Here we generate high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers of Pama-Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25-40 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting pre-Holocene population structure in the ancient continent of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all of the studied Aboriginal Australians descend from a single founding population that differentiated ∼10-32 kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia during the Holocene epoch (past 10,000 years) associated with limited gene flow from this region to the rest of Australia, consistent with the spread of the Pama-Nyungan languages. We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51-72 kya, following a single out-of-Africa dispersal, and subsequently admixed with archaic populations. Finally, we report evidence of selection in Aboriginal Australians potentially associated with living in the desert. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Nevertheless, the availability of high-resolution genomic data has led to the development of new methodologies for inferring population history and refuelled the debate on the mutation rate in humans. Here we present the Estonian Biocentre Human Genome Diversity Panel (EGDP), a dataset of 483 high-coverage human genomes from 148 populations worldwide, including 379 new genomes from 125 populations, which we group into diversity and selection sets. We analyse this dataset to refine estimates of continent-wide patterns of heterozygosity, long-and short-distance gene flow, archaic admixture, and changes in effective population size through time as well as for signals of positive or balancing selection. We find a genetic signature in present-day Papuans that suggests that at least 2% of their genome originates from an early and largely extinct expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) out of Africa. Together with evidence from the western Asian fossil record, and admixture between AMHs and Neanderthals predating the main Eurasian expansion, our results contribute to the mounting evidence for the presence of AMHs out of Africa earlier than 75,000 years ago. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"cancer; effective population size; fossil record; gene flow; genome; heterozygosity; mutation; Neanderthal; Africa; Article; Asia; cancer genetics; effective population size; Estonia; fossil human; gene flow; gene sequence; gene structure; genetic analysis; genetic database; genetic recombination; genetic variability; genome analysis; genomics; haplotype; heterozygosity; human; human activities; human genetics; human genome; migration; nonhuman; population dispersal; population genetics; population research; predation; priority journal; ancestry group; animal; ethnology; Europe; fossil; genetics; heterozygote; history; Homo neanderthalensis; human genome; information processing; migration; Oceanic ancestry group; Papua New Guinea; population dynamics; population genetics; Africa; Eurasia; Indonesia; Papua [(PRV) Indonesia]; West Asia; Africa; Animals; Asia; Continental Population Groups; Datasets as Topic; Estonia; Europe; Fossils; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Genomics; Heterozygote; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Neanderthals; New Guinea; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981502573

This nomen, formulated by Schoetensack in 1908 to describe the Mauer jaw (Germany), was almost forgotten during most of the past century. Numerous fossils have been attributed to it but no consensus has arisen concerning their classification. The holotype anatomical traits are still poorly understood, and numerous fossils with no mandibular remains have been placed in the taxon. Some researchers propose H. heidelbergensis as an Afro-European taxon that is ancestral to both modern humans and Neandertals whereas others think it is a strictly European species that is part of the Neandertal lineage. We focus on the validity of H. heidelbergensis, using the traditional basis of species recognition: anatomical description. We provide a comparative morphological analysis using 47 anatomical traits of 36 Pleistocene fossils from Africa, Asia, and Europe and 35 extant human mandibles. We re-examine the mandibular features of Mauer and discuss the specimen's inclusion in H. heidelbergensis, as well as alternative evolutionary theories. To lend objectivity to specimen grouping, we use multiple correspondence analysis associated with hierarchical classification that creates clusters corresponding to phenetic similarities between jaws. Our phenetic and comparative morphological analyses support the validity of H. heidelbergensis as a taxon. A set of morphological features can be statistically identified for the definition of the species. Some traits can be used to delimit H. heidelbergensis in an evolutionary framework (e.g., foramina mentale posteriorly positioned, horizontal retromolar surface). Those traits are also present on African (e.g., Tighenif) and European (e.g., Sima de los Huesos) specimens that show a close relationship with the Mauer mandible. Therefore, the definition of H. heidelbergensis is more precise and mainly supports the theory of an Afro-European taxon, which is the last common ancestor of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. However, the results of this study fail to entirely discount the hypothesis that considers H. heidelbergensis as a chronospecies leading to the Neandertals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In turn, this has led to suggestions that the temporal bone is particularly reliable in analyses of primate phylogeny and human population history. While several reasons have been suggested to explain the temporal bone's strong fit with neutral expectation, the temporal bone has never systematically been compared against other individual cranial bones defined using the same biological criteria. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the shapes of all cranial bones possess reliable information regarding neutral genetic evolution, or whether the temporal bone is unique in this respect. This study tests the hypothesis that the human temporal bone is more congruent with neutral expectation than six other individual cranial bones by correlating population affinity matrices generated using neutral genetic and 3D craniometric data. The results demonstrate that while the temporal bone shows the absolute strongest correlation with neutral genetic data compared with all other bones, it is not statistically differentiated from the sphenoid, frontal, and parietal bones in this regard. Potential reasons for the temporal bone's consistently strong fit with neutral expectation, such as its overall anatomical complexity and/or its contribution to the architecture of the basicranium, are examined. The results suggest that future phylogenetic and taxonomic studies would benefit from considering the shape of the entire cranium minus those regions that deviate most from neutrality. ©2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Neutral evolution; Population history; Temporal bone","article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; frontal bone; human; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phylogeny; physical anthropology; population genetics; primate; skull; sphenoid; temporal bone; Bone Development; Classification; Fossils; Gene Frequency; Genetic Markers; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Skull; Temporal Bone; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349102576

This study assessed the phylogenetic utility of six different human cranial regions, plus the entire cranium. Three-dimensional landmark data were collected for 83 landmarks from samples of skulls from 14 modern human populations. The data were subsequently divided into anatomical regions: basicranium, upper face, mandible, temporal bone, upper jaw, cranial vault, and a subset of points from around the entire cranium. Depictions of population molecular distances were calculated using published data on microsatellites for the same or closely related populations. Distances based on morphological variation of each of the anatomical regions were compared with molecular distances, and the correlations assessed. The morphology of the basicranium, temporal bone, upper face, and entire cranium demonstrated the highest correlations with molecular distances. The morphology of the mandible, upper jaw, and cranial vault, as measured here, were not significantly correlated with molecular distances. As the three-dimensional morphology of the temporal bone, upper face, basicranium, and entire cranium appear to consistently reflect genetic relationships in humans, especially with more reliability than the cranial vault, it would be preferable to focus on these regions when attempting to determine the genetic relationships of human specimens with no molecular data. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"anatomical variation; article; craniofacial morphology; epigenetics; human; maxilla; microsatellite marker; molecular biology; morphological trait; phylogeny; physical anthropology; population genetics; priority journal; reliability; temporal bone; three dimensional imaging; Anthropology, Physical; Continental Population Groups; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Humans; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-59549091063

Because humans inhabit environments that can be seen as extreme from the perspective of respiratory function, nasal cavity shape is expected to show climatic adaptation. This study examines the relationship between modern human variation in the morphology of the nasal cavity and the climatic factors of temperature and vapor pressure, and tests the hypothesis that within increasingly demanding environments (colder and drier), nasal cavities will show features that enhance turbulence and air-wall contact to improve conditioning of the air. We use three-dimensional geometric morphometrics methods and multivariate statistics to model and analyze the shape of the bony nasal cavity of 10 modern human population samples from five climatic groups. We report significant correlations between nasal cavity shape and climatic variables of both temperature and humidity. Variation in nasal cavity shape is correlated with a cline from cold-dry climates to hot-humid climates, with a separate temperature and vapor pressure effect. The bony nasal cavity appears mostly associated with temperature, and the nasopharynx with humidity. The observed climate-related shape changes are functionally consistent with an increase in contact between air and mucosal tissue in cold-dry climates through greater turbulence during inspiration and a higher surface-to-volume ratio in the upper nasal cavity.

Previous descriptions of human mandibles showed variation in ramal height and breadth to be the strongest difference among recent human groups. Several mandibular traits that differentiate Neanderthals from modern humans include greater robusticity, a receding symphysis, a large retromolar space, a rounder gonial area, an asymmetric mandibular notch, and a posteriorly positioned mental foramen in Neanderthals. Nevertheless, the degree to which these differences are part of modern human variation and/or are related to size and function remains unclear. The aim of this study was to document geographic and functional patterning in the mandibular shape of recent humans, to assess the effects of allometry on mandibular form, and to quantitatively evaluate proposed ""Neanderthai"" mandibular traits through comparison with samples of geographically diverse recent humans. Data were collected in the form of three-dimensional coordinates of 28 landmarks. Unlike previous studies, this analysis found that modern human mandibular shape exhibits considerable geographic patterning, with some aspects of mandibular morphology reflecting a climatic gradient, and others, a functional specialization. Population history is also reflected in mandibular form, albeit relatively weakly. Proposed ""Neanderthal"" traits were found to separate Neanderthal from modern human mandibles successfully in the statistical analysis. Of these, the retromolar gap was found to be related to increased mandibular size in modern humans. The status of this trait as a Neanderthal autapomorphy should therefore be treated with caution. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate; Modern human variation; Neanderthals; Paramasticatory behavior","allometry; article; bone structure; geometry; history; human; mandible; morphometrics; physical anthropology; population biology; quantitative analysis; three dimensional imaging; Anatomy, Comparative; Animals; Arctic Regions; Asia; Europe; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mandible; Paleodontology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750063463

Here we point out the essential features of symphyseal morphology in H. sapiens, which are present and well-defined in the fetus at least as early as the fifth gestational month. Differences among adults in expression of these structures, particularly in the prominence of the mental tuberosity, are developmental epiphenomena and serve to emphasize the importance of studying this region in juveniles whenever possible. A survey of various middle to late Pleistocene fossil hominids for which juveniles are known reveals that these features are present in some late Pleistocene specimens assigned to H. sapiens, but not in all of the presumed anatomically modern H. sapiens (i.e., Qafzeh 8, 9, and 11). The adult specimens from Skhul, as well as the adult Qafzeh 7 specimen, are similarly distinctive in symphyseal morphology. Neanderthals are quite variable in their own right, and they as well as other middle to late Pleistocene fossils lack the symphyseal features of H. sapiens. Some of the latter are, however, seen in the Tighenif (Ternifine) mandibles.","Chin; Homo sapiens; Neanderthals; Qafzeh; Skhul","bone; evolution; morphometry; Animalia; Hominidae; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Mammalia; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034079748

However, this has yet to be analyzed at a global level. Here, the relationship between global mandibular shape variation and subsistence economy is tested, while controlling for the potentially confounding effects of shared population history, geography, and climate. The results demonstrate that the mandible, in contrast to the cranium, significantly reflects subsistence strategy rather than neutral genetic patterns, with hunter-gatherers having consistently longer and narrower mandibles than agriculturalists. These results support notions that a decrease in masticatory stress among agriculturalists causes the mandible to grow and develop differently. This developmental argument also explains why there is often a mismatch between the size of the lower face and the dentition, which, in turn, leads to increased prevalence of dental crowding and malocclusions in modern postindustrial populations.

Despite their potential for expanding the area of prime hominin habitats and favouring out-of-Africa dispersals, GSPs have not been incorporated into the narrative of hominin evolution due to poor knowledge of their timing, dynamics and landscape composition at evolutionary timescales. We present a compilation of continental and marine paleoenvironmental records from within and around North Africa, which enables identification of over 230 GSPs within the last 8 million years. By combining the main climatological determinants of woody cover in tropical Africa with paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic data for representative (Holocene and Eemian) GSPs, we estimate precipitation regimes and habitat distributions during GSPs. Their chronology is consistent with the ages of Saharan archeological and fossil hominin sites. Each GSP took 2-3 kyr to develop, peaked over 4-8 kyr, biogeographically connected the African tropics to African and Eurasian mid latitudes, and ended within 2-3 kyr, which resulted in rapid habitat fragmentation. We argue that the well-dated succession of GSPs presented here may have played an important role in migration and evolution of hominins. © 2013 Larrasoaña et al.",,"article; biogeography; climate change; evolution; fossil hominin; geological time; green Sahara period; habitat fragmentation; hominid; landscape; marine environment; meteorology; nonhuman; North Africa; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; savanna; species habitat; tropics; vegetation; Africa, Northern; Animals; Biological Evolution; Climate; Ecosystem; Hominidae; Phylogeography; Rain; Time Factors; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885749253

In extant human populations, the observation of decreasing genetic and phenotypic diversity at increasing distances from sub-Saharan Africa has been interpreted as evidence for a single dispersal, accompanied by a series of founder effects. In such a scenario, modern human genetic and phenotypic variation was primarily generated through successive population bottlenecks and drift during a rapid worldwide expansion out of Africa in the Late Pleistocene. However, recent genetic studies, as well as accumulating archaeological and paleoanthropological evidence, challenge this parsimonious model. They suggest instead a ""southern route"" dispersal into Asia as early as the late Middle Pleistocene, followed by a separate dispersal into northern Eurasia. Here we test these competing out-of-Africa scenarios by modeling hypothetical geographical migration routes and assessing their correlation with neutral population differentiation, as measured by genetic polymorphisms and cranial shape variables of modern human populations from Africa and Asia. We showthat both lines of evidence support amultiple-dispersalsmodel in which Australo-Melanesian populations are relatively isolated descendants of an early dispersal, whereas other Asian populations are descended from, or highly admixed with, members of a subsequent migration event.",,"Africa; archeology; article; Asia; biodiversity; controlled study; evolution; founder effect; gene mutation; genetic drift; genetic polymorphism; genomics; human; Middle Pleistocene; paleoanthropology; phenotypic variation; population; population differentiation; population migration; population structure; priority journal; temporal bone; Upper Pleistocene; cranial diversity; genome diversity; human evolution; modern human origins; SNPs; Africa; Asia; Biological Evolution; Founder Effect; Genomics; Geography; Human Migration; Humans; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Population Dynamics; Skull; Software",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901008925

However, low collagen content, contamination from the burial environment, or museum conservation work, such as addition of glues, preservatives, and fumigants to ""protect"" archaeological materials, have previously led to inaccurate dates. These inaccuracies in turn frustrate the development of archaeological chronologies and, in the Paleolithic, blur the dating of such key events as the dispersal of anatomically modern humans. Here we describe a method to date hydroxyproline found in collagen (∼10% of collagen carbon) as a bone-specific biomarker that removes impurities, thereby improving dating accuracy and confidence. This method is applied to two important sites in Russia and allows us to report the earliest direct ages for the presence of anatomically modern humans on the Russian Plain. These dates contribute considerably to our understanding of the emergence of the Mid-Upper Paleolithic and the complex suite of burial behaviors that begin to appear during this period.","Accelerator mass spectrometry; HPLC; Kostenki; Sungir","amino acid; collagen; hydroxyproline; accuracy; anatomical variation; article; bone; environmental factor; genetic conservation; human; Paleolithic; priority journal; radiometric dating; Russian Federation; Animals; Biological Markers; Bone and Bones; Carbon Radioisotopes; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Collagen; Fossils; Funeral Rites; History, Ancient; Hydroxyproline; Mass Spectrometry; Nitrogen; Russia; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860819329

Here we report on a case of inter-group violence towards a group of hunter-gatherers from Nataruk, west of Lake Turkana, which during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene period extended about 30 km beyond its present-day shore. Ten of the twelve articulated skeletons found at Nataruk show evidence of having died violently at the edge of a lagoon, into which some of the bodies fell. The remains from Nataruk are unique, preserved by the particular conditions of the lagoon with no evidence of deliberate burial. They offer a rare glimpse into the life and death of past foraging people, and evidence that warfare was part of the repertoire of inter-group relations among prehistoric hunter-gatherers. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

At the same time, human remains from this time period are scarce in Africa, and even rarer in West Africa. The Iwo Eleru burial is one of the few human skeletal remains associated with Later Stone Age artifacts in that region with a proposed Pleistocene date. We undertook a morphometric reanalysis of this cranium in order to better assess its affinities. We also conducted Uranium-series dating to re-evaluate its chronology. Methodology/Principal Findings: A 3-D geometric morphometric analysis of cranial landmarks and semilandmarks was conducted using a large comparative fossil and modern human sample. The measurements were collected in the form of three dimensional coordinates and processed using Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Principal components, canonical variates, Mahalanobis D 2 and Procrustes distance analyses were performed. The results were further visualized by comparing specimen and mean configurations. Results point to a morphological similarity with late archaic African specimens dating to the Late Pleistocene. A long bone cortical fragment was made available for U-series analysis in order to re-date the specimen. The results (~11.7-6.3 ka) support a terminal Pleistocene chronology for the Iwo Eleru burial as was also suggested by the original radiocarbon dating results and by stratigraphic evidence. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings are in accordance with suggestions of deep population substructure in Africa and a complex evolutionary process for the origin of modern humans. They further highlight the dearth of hominin finds from West Africa, and underscore our real lack of knowledge of human evolution in that region. © 2011 Harvati et al.",,"uranium; article; bone age; calvaria; chronology; cortical bone; fossil human; human; human tissue; morphology; morphometrics; Nigeria; skull; statistical analysis; Stone Age; Upper Pleistocene; animal; audiovisual equipment; evolution; female; fossil; geography; histology; hominid; male; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; skull; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Biological Evolution; Female; Fossils; Geography; Hominidae; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Models, Anatomic; Multivariate Analysis; Nigeria; Principal Component Analysis; Skull",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052844069

We show that neutral processes have been much more important than climate in shaping the human cranium.

The mandible from Mauer (Homo heidelbergensis), dated to circa 500,000 years ago, continues to represent the earliest German hominin and may coincide with the occupation of Europe north of the high alpine mountain chains. Only limited new evidence is available for the Middle Pleistocene, mostly in the form of skull fragments, a pattern that may relate to taphonomic processes. These finds and their ages suggest the gradual evolution of a suite of Neandertal features during this period. Despite new finds of classic Neandertals, there is no clear proof for Neandertal burial from Germany. Alternatively, cut marks on a skull fragment from the Neandertal type site suggest special treatment of that individual. New Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates of previous finds leave little reliably dated evidence for anatomically modern humans (AMH) in Europe before 30,000 BP; the remains from Hahnöfersand, Binshof-Speyer, Paderborn-Sande, and Vogelherd are now of Holocene age. Thus, a correlation of AMH with the Aurignacian remains to be proven, and the general idea of a long coexistence of Neandertals and AMH in Europe may be questioned. In western Central Europe, evidence of Gravettian human fossils is also very limited, although a new double grave from lower Austria may be relevant. The only dated burial from the German Upper Paleolithic (from Mittlere Klause) falls into a time period (circa 18,600 BP) represented by only a few occupation sites in western Central Europe. A number of human remains at Magdalenian sites appear to result from variable (secondary) burial practices. In contrast, the Final Paleolithic (circa 12,000-9600 cal. BC) yields an increase of hominin finds, including multiple burials (Bonn-Oberkassel, Neuwied-Irlich), similar to the situation in western and southern Europe. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The homoiology hypothesis predicts that osseous regions subject to repeated biomechanical stress during growth should be more variable and, therefore, less reliable for the reconstruction of phylogeny compared with osseous regions relatively unaffected by stress. Previous studies based on the analysis of multiple primate species found that regions of the cranium subject to masticatory-induced stress were significantly more variable than non-masticatory regions, as predicted by the homoiology hypothesis. However, these studies also found that the masticatory regions were no less reliable for reconstructing primate phylogenetic relationships when subjected to parsimony analysis. It was suggested, therefore, that homoiology may be a more potent problem for the reconstruction of phylogeny at the intraspecific level rather than interspecific phylogenetics. This suggestion was tested here using matched molecular and craniometric data for 12 modern human populations. The results show that, as predicted by the homoiology hypothesis, regions of the human cranium related to mastication were more variable than non-masticatory regions. However, masticatory regions were no less reliable for inferring human population history. Therefore, the results match those found from the interspecific analysis of primate species and do not support the suggestion that homoiology is a greater problem for the analysis of intraspecific taxa. The results also suggest that within-taxon variability cannot be relied upon to predict the phylogenetic efficacy of morphometric characters. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Much of this difficulty is rooted in the historical use of craniometric data to justify essentialist typological racial classification schemes. In the post-war era of the 'New Physical Anthropology' (sensu Washburn, 1951), anthropologists began to analyse human variation in an explicitly populationist and evolutionary philosophical and analytical framework. However, even within recent decades, substantially different approaches have been employed; some advocate a focus on the analysis of individual traits or clines, while others are explicitly adaptationist, with a focus on natural selection as the preeminent force of phenotypic diversification. In recent years, a series of studies have analysed craniometric data in an explicitly quantitative genetic framework, which emphasises the importance of neutral forces such as migration, gene flow and genetic drift in creating global patterns of phenotypic diversity. This approach has revealed that global patterns of cranial variation can largely be explained on the basis of neutral theory. Therefore, human cranial data can be productively employed as a proxy for neutral genetic data in archaeological contexts. Moreover, there is a growing recognition that regions of the cranium differ in the extent to which they fit a neutral model of microevolutionary expectation, allowing for a more detailed assessment of patterns of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity within the human skull. Taking an historical perspective, the current state of knowledge regarding patterns of cranial adaptation in response to climatic and dietary effects is reviewed. Further insights will be gained by better incorporating the study of cranial and postcranial variation, as well as understanding the impact of neutral versus non-neutral evolution in creating amongspecies diversity patterns in primates more generally. However, this will most effectively be achieved when comparative anatomy studies are situated within an explicitly quantitative genetic evolutionary framework.","Adaptation; Cranial variation; Microevolution; Population history; Quantitative genetics","adaptation; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; climate; evolution; feeding behavior; human; phenotype; physical anthropology; physiology; population genetics; skull; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Biological Evolution; Cephalometry; Climate; Food Habits; Genetics, Population; Humans; Phenotype; Skull",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895168539

Wankel in 1884, K.J. Maška in 1894, M. Kříž in 1895, and K. Absolon in 1928 (and probably 1930), represent one of the largest collections of early modern human remains. Unfortunately, most of these fossils were destroyed in 1945. The aim of this paper is to create a list of finds in accordance with the discovery dates, to place them into the spatial and chronological context of the site, and to compare them with the evidence from recent excavation in 2006. Two competing hypotheses are raised in the literature suggesting that the Předmostí individuals represent either a contemporary burial as a consequence of one catastrophic event, or a gradual accumulation of human bodies at one place. Whereas the first hypothesis is supported by the demographic structure of the buried group, including adults and children, the second interpretation is based on stratigraphic and taphonomic analysis of the burial area itself. Using the original documentation of Maška and other early researchers, and my own experience from recent excavation in the remaining part of the site, I attempt to reconstruct the plan of the site, with a focus on spatial distribution of the human fossils, especially in the main burial area. I suggest that the burial place was not the settlement center, but rather a peripheral and task-specific area. The determining factor for location of the burial area was likely the remarkable Skalka rock, a cliff that rose directly above the site. A long-term tendency to place the dead ""below the rock"" may have given rise to the accumulation of human remains at a single place, with a scatter of dispersed fragments in the vicinity. At this location, the human bodies were partly protected by soil coverage, limestone debris, and mammoth scapulae, but were also affected by postdepositional processes such as redeposition of sediments, predator activities, and later human activities, including the burial of additional corpses. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A revised chronology based on 26 accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates on ostrich eggshells indicates an age range of 23,576-22,887 y B.P. for KNM-LH 1, confirming prior attribution to the Last Glacial Maximum.

Comparative morphometric analyses of the KNM-LH 1 cranium document the temporal and spatial complexity of early modern human morphological variability.

However, the influence of subsistence strategy on global cranial variation is less clear, having been confirmed only for the mandible, and dietary effects beyond agriculture are often neglected. Here we identify global patterns of subsistence-related human cranial shape variation. We analysed a worldwide sample of 15 populations (n=255) with known subsistence strategies using 3-D landmark datasets designed to capture the shape of different units of the cranium. Results show significant correlations between global cranial shape and diet, especially for temporalis muscle shape and general cranial shape. Importantly, the differences between populations with either a plant- or an animal-based diet are more pronounced than those between agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers, suggesting that the influence of diet as driver of cranial variation is not limited to Holocene transitions to agricultural subsistence. Dental arch shape did not correlate with subsistence pattern, possibly indicating the high plasticity of this region of the face in relation to age, disease and individual use of the dentition. Our results highlight the importance of subsistence strategy as one of the factors underlying the evolution of human geographic cranial variation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Diet; Geometric morphometrics; Masticatory adaptation; Partial least squares analysis","adaptation; cranium; diet; Holocene; human evolution; least squares method; morphometry; subsistence; Animalia; agriculture; anatomy and histology; climate; diet; evolution; geography; human; mandible; meat; population dynamics; skull; tooth arch; vegetarian diet; Agriculture; Biological Evolution; Climate; Dental Arch; Diet; Diet, Vegetarian; Geography; Humans; Mandible; Meat; Population Dynamics; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923635241

Archaeological evidence characterises these inhabitants as having been heavily influenced by outside sources; yet they managed to establish and maintain their own distinctive culture as seen in the site features and surviving artefact collections. The dental study, modelled after the original craniometric-based investigation and using the same or similar comparative samples, detected complementary indications of outside biological influence. In the study, up to 36 dental traits were recorded in a total of 19 African samples. The most influential traits in driving inter-sample variation were then identified, and phenetic affinities were calculated using the Mahalanobis D2 statistic for non-metric traits. If phenetic similarity provides an estimate of genetic relatedness, these affinities, like the original craniometric findings, suggest that the Jebel Moyans exhibited a mosaic of features that are reminiscent of, yet distinct from, both sub-Saharan and North African peoples. Together, these different lines of evidence correspond to portray the Jebel Moya populace as a uniform, although distinct, biocultural amalgam.

Omo I, from Kamoya's Hominid Site (KHS), consists of much of a skeleton, including most of the cranial vault, parts of the face and mandible, and many postcranial elements. Omo II, from Paul's Hominid Site (PHS), is a virtually complete calvaria. Only a limited fauna and a few stone artifacts attributed to the Middle Stone Age were recovered in conjunction with the fossil hominids. The available dating techniques suggested a very early age, over 100 ka, for Member I, from which the Omo I and Omo II fossils were recovered. However, in subsequent decades, the reliability of the dates and the provenance of the Kibish hominids were repeatedly questioned. The papers in this volume provide a detailed stratigraphic analysis of the Kibish Formation and a series of new radiometric dates that indicate an age of 196 ± 2 ka for Member I and 104 ± 1 for Member III, confirming the antiquity of the lower parts of the Kibish Formation and, in turn, the fossils from Member I. Studies of the postcranial remains of Omo I indicate an overall modern human morphology with a number of primitive features. Studies of an extensive lithic record from Members I and III indicate a Middle Stone Age technology comparable to assemblages of similar age elsewhere in Ethiopia. Studies of the mammalian, avian, and fish faunas indicate overall similarities to those found in the region today, with a few distinctive differences. © 2008.","Ethiopia; Homo sapiens; Modern humans; Omo River","anthropology; biostratigraphy; cranium; fauna; hominid; Mesolithic; morphology; radiometric method; skeletal remains; Africa; East Africa; Ethiopia; Sub-Saharan Africa; Aves; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-50849100410

Ancient shorelines and lake sediments at 1940 m suggest that these two lakes formed a single large and deep lake as a result of a wetter climate during the early Holocene. Here, we used a hydrological model to compare the precipitation-evaporation balance during the early Holocene to today. Assuming that the Nakuru-Elmenteita basin was hydrologically closed, as it is today, the most likely climate scenario includes a 45% increase in mean-annual precipitation, a 0.5°C decrease in air temperature, and an increase of 9% in cloud coverage from the modern values. Compared to the modeling results from other East African lake basins, this dramatic increase in precipitation seems to be unrealistic. Therefore, we propose a significant flow of water from the early Holocene Lake Naivasha in the south towards the Nakuru-Elmenteita basin to compensate the extremely negative hydrological budget of this basin. Since we did not find any field evidence for a surface connection, as often proposed during the last 70 years, the hydrological deficit of the Nakuru-Elmenteita basin could have also been compensated by a subsurface water exchange. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","East Africa; Hydrological modeling; Nakuru-Elmenteita; Paleoclimate","evaporation; Holocene; hydrological modeling; lake; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); water budget; Africa; East Africa; East African Rift; Kenya; Kenya Rift; Nakuru; Rift Valley; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749473170

However, the extent of subsequent human entry before the European colonial age is less clear. The dingo reached Australia about 4 kya, indirectly implying human contact, which some have linked to changes in language and stone tool technology to suggest substantial cultural changes at the same time [3]. Genetic data of two kinds have been proposed to support gene flow from the Indian subcontinent to Australia at this time, as well: first, signs of South Asian admixture in Aboriginal Australian genomes have been reported on the basis of genome-wide SNP data [4]; and second, a Y chromosome lineage designated haplogroup C-, present in both India and Australia, was estimated to have a most recent common ancestor around 5 kya and to have entered Australia from India [5]. Here, we sequence 13 Aboriginal Australian Y chromosomes to re-investigate their divergence times from Y chromosomes in other continents, including a comparison of Aboriginal Australian and South Asian haplogroup C chromosomes. We find divergence times dating back to ∼50 kya, thus excluding the Y chromosome as providing evidence for recent gene flow from India into Australia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,"Australia; ethnology; gene flow; genetics; haplotype; human; India; male; Oceanic ancestry group; Papua New Guinea; phylogeny; Y chromosome; Australia; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Gene Flow; Haplotypes; Humans; India; Male; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Papua New Guinea; Phylogeny",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959135817

Some evidence suggests correspondingly worldwide changes in skull shape and form across the agricultural transition, although these changes have proved difficult to characterize at a global scale. Here, adapting a quantitative genetics mixed model for complex phenotypes, we quantify the influence of diet on global human skull shape and form. We detect modest directional differences between foragers and farmers. The effects are consistent with softer diets in preindustrial farming groups and are most pronounced and reliably directional when the farming class is limited to dairying populations. Diet effect magnitudes are relatively small, affirming the primary role of neutral evolutionary processes—genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow structured by population history and migrations—in shaping diversity in the human skull. The results also bring an additional perspective to the paradox of why Homo sapiens, particularly agriculturalists, appear to be relatively well suited to efficient (high-leverage) chewing. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

The fossils and stone tools that record the spatial distribution of our species in the past form the backbone of our evolutionary history, and one that allows us to explore the different processes-cultural and biological-that acted to shape the evolution of different populations in the face of major climate change. Those processes created a complex palimpsest of similarities and differences, with outcomes that were at times accelerated by sharp demographic and geographical fluctuations. The result is that the population ancestral to all modern humans did not look or behave like people alive today. This has generated questions regarding the evolution of human universal characters, as well as the nature and timing of major evolutionary events in the history of Homo sapiens. The paucity of African fossils remains a serious stumbling block for exploring some of these issues. However, fossil and archaeological discoveries increasingly clarify important aspects of our past, while breakthroughs from genomics and palaeogenomics have revealed aspects of the demography of Late Quaternary Eurasian hominin groups and their interactions, as well as those between for- agers and farmers. This paper explores the nature and timing of key moments in the evolution of human diversity, moments in which population collapse followed by differential expansion of groups set the conditions for transitional periods. Five transitions are identified (i) at the origins of the species, 240-200 ka; (ii) at the time of the first major expansions, 130-100 ka; (iii) during a period of dispersals, 70-50 ka; (iv) across a phase of local/regional structuring of diversity, 45-25 ka; and (v) during a phase of significant extinction of hunter-gatherer diversity and expansion of particular groups, such as farmers and later societies (the Holocene Filter), 15-0 ka. © 2016 The Authors.","African prehistory; Dispersals; Holocene filter; Human evolution; Human evolutionary genetics; Modern human origins","ancestry; archaeology; climate change; dispersal; evolutionary biology; fossil record; hominid; human evolution; origin of life; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; prehistoric; spatial distribution; species diversity; tool use; Africa; Homo sapiens; archeology; cultural anthropology; evolution; geography; human; lifestyle; migration; population dynamics; Archaeology; Biological Evolution; Cultural Evolution; Emigration and Immigration; Geography; Humans; Life Style; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974733390

A total of 50 sites that can be constrained from MIS 6-2 have yielded specimens ranging from isolated teeth to nearly complete skeletons. However, only a dozen or so provide particularly informative or interesting evidence spanning this period of nearly 200 kyr. In addition to the rather paltry nature of the record, one of the seemingly more intractable problems that bedevil its interpretation is the nature of the chronometric record for many of the sites. The Late Pleistocene terrestrial climatic record for Africa is also rather patchy, making continent-wide generalizations difficult. Attempts to link large-scale environmental perturbations in Africa to patterns of human evolution and behavior are even more problematic. Although the African fossil (and archaeological) record is most often viewed from the perspective of a single lineage culminating in the appearance of Homo sapiens and thence modern humans, the degree of morphological diversity evident even in this meager assemblage can be rather striking. Some of this diversity may be related to geographic and/or temporal differences, but in other instances, there are noticeable differences among remains that are contemporaneous, or at least penecontemporaneous. The Late Pleistocene African hominin fossil record, despite its manifestly incomplete nature, finds consistency with an impressive array of genetic evidence that points to an African origin for our species, and it also has consilience with genetic data that indicate a coalescence of lineages to the common ancestor of Homo sapiens at around the beginning of MIS 6. Although multiple lines of genetic evidence indicate a deep separation of lineages, with the ancestors of the southern African Khoesan diverging early on from that which gave rise to all other groups, there is a notable paucity of human remains that predate MIS 2 that exhibit strong phenetic resemblance to recent African populations. A number of the human dental samples from Late Pleistocene South African sites possess morphological variants that characterize the teeth of the recent inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa, but these similarities do not necessarily signify a close evolutionary relationship with any of these populations because they appear to be plesiomorphic. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cranium; Dentition; Later Stone Age; Middle Paleolithic; Middle Stone Age; Postcranial skeleton; Upper Paleolithic",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044978554

The patterns and intensity of shape covariation, and how this is related to diet, are essential for understanding the evolution of functional masticatory adaptations of the human cranium. Within a worldwide sample (n=255) of 15 populations with different modes of subsistence, we use partial least squares analysis to study the relationships between three components of the MA: upper dental arch, masseter muscle, and temporalis muscle attachments. We show that the shape of the masseter muscle and the shape of the temporalis muscle clearly covary with one another, but that the shape of the dental arch seems to be rather independent of the masticatory muscles. On the contrary, when relative positioning, orientation, and size of the masticatory components is included in the analysis, the dental arch shows the highest covariation with the other cranial parts, indicating that these additional factors are more important than just shape with regard to covariation within the MA. Covariation patterns among these cranial regions differ mainly between hunting-fishing and gathering-agriculture groups, possibly relating to greater masticatory strains resulting from a large meat component in the diet. High-strain groups show stronger covariation between upper dental arch and masticatory muscle shape when compared with low-strain groups. These results help to provide a clearer understanding of constraints and interlinkage of shape variation within the human MA and allow for more realistic modeling and predictions in future biomechanical studies.

This paper reviews the genetic, archaeological, and fossil evidence for the evolution of modern humans across MIS 6-2 in eastern Africa, and places this into the context of Middle Pleistocene human evolution, the development of the Middle Stone Age across the continent, and climatic change over the last two glacial cycles. We argue that while there is a paucity of well-dated sites that reduces the resolution of any interpretation, the available evidence indicates a major role for eastern Africa as an area of endemism, most probably related to the interaction of mosaic environments and refugia. We show that the evolution of modern humans has roots that extend well before MIS 6, and propose four overlapping stages, making this a much more prolonged process than has traditionally been described. There is a broad relationship between evolutionary history and major climatic oscillations; nevertheless, a closer examination reveals a more complex pattern. There are periods of synchrony and asynchrony in both contextual and evolutionary/behavioral changes, and these show variable links to both northern and southern Africa. Although eastern, northern and southern Africa (with central and western being largely unknown) show similarities and ultimately the same evolutionary and behavioral outcome, they also exhibit independent trajectories that require further research to throw light on the processes involved. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","African biogeography; Anatomically modern humans; East African prehistory; Marine Isotope Stages; Middle Stone Age; Paleoclimate",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974702465

This situation is due largely to the dearth of human fossil remains dating to the final Pleistocene in Africa and their almost total absence from West and Central Africa, thus limiting our perception of modern human diversification within Africa before the Holocene.Here, we present a morphometric comparative analysis of the earliest Late Pleistocene modern human remains from the Central African site of Ishango in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The early Late Stone Age layer (eLSA) of this site, dated to the Last Glacial Maximum (25-20 Ky), contains more than one hundred fragmentary human remains. The exceptional associated archaeological context suggests these remains derived from a community of hunter-fisher-gatherers exhibiting complex social and cognitive behaviors including substantial reliance on aquatic resources, development of fishing technology, possible mathematical notations and repetitive use of space, likely on a seasonal basis.Comparisons with large samples of Late Pleistocene and early Holocene modern human fossils from Africa and Eurasia show that the Ishango human remains exhibit distinctive characteristics and a higher phenotypic diversity in contrast to recent African populations. In many aspects, as is true for the inner ear conformation, these eLSA human remains have more affinities with Middle to early Late Pleistocene fossils worldwide than with extant local African populations. In addition, cross-sectional geometric properties of the long bones are consistent with archaeological evidence suggesting reduced terrestrial mobility resulting from greater investment in and use of aquatic resources.Our results on the Ishango human remains provide insights into past African modern human diversity and adaptation that are consistent with genetic theories about the deep sub-structure of Late Pleistocene African populations and their complex evolutionary history of isolation and diversification. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Central Africa; Early Late Stone Age (eLSA); Late Pleistocene; Modern human evolution; Phenotypic diversity","fossil; human evolution; morphometry; phenotype; skeletal remains; Stone Age; Democratic Republic Congo; adolescent; adult; anatomy and histology; archeology; body remains; child; Democratic Republic Congo; evolution; fossil; human; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Archaeology; Biological Evolution; Body Remains; Child; Child, Preschool; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Fossils; Humans; Young Adult",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969974186
