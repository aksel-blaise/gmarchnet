Box 80.115, Utrecht, TC 3508, Netherlands","This paper discusses advantages and shortcomings of the S environment for multivariable geostatistics, in particular when extended with the gstat package, an extension package for the S environments (R, S-Plus). The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this report is to provide a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of the Pleistocene when sea levels were below present day levels. Location: The maps presented here cover tropical Southeast Asia and Austral-Asia. The east-west coverage extends 8000 km from Australia to Sri Lanka. The north-south coverage extends 5000 km from Taiwan to Australia. Methods: Present-day bathymetric depth contours were used to estimate past shore lines and the locations of the major drowned river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves. The timing of sea level changes associated with glaciation over the past 250,000 years was taken from multiple sources that, in some cases, account for tectonic uplift and subsidence during the period in question. Results: This report provides a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of 17,000, 150,000 and 250,000 years before present. The ancient shorelines are based on present day depth contours of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 120 m. On the maps depicting shorelines at 75, 100 and 120 m below present levels the major Pleistocene river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves are depicted. Estimates of the number of major sea level fluctuation events and the duration of time that sea levels were at or below the illustrated level are provided. Main conclusions: Previous reconstructions of sea-level change during the Pleistocene have emphasized the maximum lows. The perspective provided here emphasizes that sea levels were at their maximum lows for relatively short periods of time but were at or below intermediate levels (e.g. at or below 40 m below present-day levels) for more than half of each of the time periods considered.","Biogeography; Maps; Palaeogeography; Pleistocene; Sea levels; Southeast Asia","deglaciation; glaciation; Pleistocene; river system; sea level change; shoreline change; timescale; Asia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034492377

In this study, samples of modern and prehistoric hunter–gatherers and agriculturalists are used to test the hypothesis that there are systematic differences in patterns of tooth wear related to major differences in subsistence and food preparation. Flatness of molar wear is compared for five groups of hunter–gatherers (N = 298) and five groups of early agriculturalists (N = 365). Hunter–gatherers are predicted to develop flatter molar wear due to the mastication of tough and fibrous foods, whereas agriculturalists should develop oblique molar wear due to an increase in the proportion of ground and prepared food in the diet. A method is presented for the quantitative measurement and analysis of flatness of molar wear. Comparisons of wear plane angle are made between teeth matched for the same stage of occlusal surface wear, thus standardizing all groups to the same rate of wear. Agriculturalists develop highly angled occlusal wear planes on the entire molar dentition. Their wear plane angles tend to exceed hunter–gatherers by about 10° in advanced wear. Wear plane angles are similar within subsistence divisions despite regional differences in particular foods. This approach can be used to provide supporting evidence of change in human subsistence and to test dietary hypotheses in hominoid evolution.

Since its synonimization into Homo, views of the species and its distribution have varied from a single, widely dispersed, polytypic species ultimately ancestral to all later Homo, to a derived, regional isolate ultimately marginal to later hominin evolution. A revised chronostratigraphic framework and recent work bearing either directly or indirectly on reconstructions of life-history patterns are reviewed here and, together with a review of the cranial and postcranial anatomy of H. erectus, are used to generate a natural history of the species. Here I argue that H. erectus is a hominin, notable for its increased body size, that originates in the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene of Africa and quickly disperses into Western and Eastern Asia. It is also an increasingly derived hominin with several regional morphs sustained by intermittent isolation, particularly in Southeast Asia. This view differs from several current views, most especially that which recognizes only a single hominin species in the Pleistocene, H. sapiens, and those which would atomize H. erectus into a multiplicity of taxa. Following Jolly ([2001] Yrbk Phys Anthropol 44:177-204), the regional morphs of H. erectus may be productively viewed as geographically replacing allotaxa, rather than as the focus of unresolvable species debates. Such a view allows us to focus on the adaptations and biology of local groups, including questions of biogeographic isolation and local adaptation. A number of issues remain unresolved, including the significance of diversity in size and shape in the early African and Georgian records. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Africa; China; Dispersal; H. ergaster; Indonesia; Life history","anatomical variation; anatomy; biodiversity; biogeographic region; chronosequence; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; geographic distribution; history; hominid; homo erectus; human; life history; Pliocene; review; stratigraphy; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Pithecanthropus",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0942301483

The accuracy of linear measurements of enamel thickness and cortical bone thickness taken from CT scans is evaluated by making comparison with measurements taken directly from physical sections. The measurements of cortical bone are taken on extant and fossil specimens with and without attached matrix, and the dental specimens studied include a sample of 12 extant human molars. Local CT numbers (representing X‐ray, attenuation) are used to determine the exact position of the boundaries of a structure. Using this technique most studied dimensions, including four of human molar enamel thickness, could be obtained from CT scans with a maximum error range of ±0.1 mm.

Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Canonical variate analysis; Linear discriminant function; Ordination; Principal component analysis; Procrustes; Selection gradient",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952312407

Together with information about developmental timing they ultimately contribute to a better understanding of Neanderthal extinction. Primate molar tooth development tracks the pace of life history evolution most closely, and tooth histology reveals a record of birth as well as the timing of crown and root growth. High-resolution micro-computed tomography now allows us to image complex structures and uncover subtle differences in adult tooth morphology that are determined early in embryonic development. Here we show that the timing of molar crown and root completion in Neanderthals matches those known for modern humans but that a more complex enamel-dentine junction morphology and a late peak in root extension rate sets them apart.

Complex patterns of individual or group differences can be studied effectively by ordinations of shape space or form space. Allometry, the statistical relationship between size and shape, is estimated in geometric morphometrics by regression of the Procrustes shape coordinates on centroid size. We illustrate these methods by an application to human face shape. We reveal shape cues to body size in the adult male face, partly resembling ontogenetic allometry.

The weighted mean of six meaningful age measurements, 0.77 ± 0.08 million years (Myr, mean ± s.e.m.), provides the best age estimate for lower cultural layers 7-10. Together with previously reported U-series dating of speleothem calcite and palaeomagnetic stratigraphy, as well as sedimentological considerations, these layers may be further correlated to S6-S7 in Chinese loess stratigraphy or marine isotope stages (MIS) 17-19, in the range of ∼0.68 to 0.78 Myr ago.

Our understanding of enamel thickness and distribution patterns, however, has so far been based mostly on the limited information available from physical cross sections of the crown. In this study, the 3-dimensional (3D) whole crown enamel distribution pattern was explored in 74 extant great ape and modern human molars. Serial cross sections obtained from microfocal X-ray computed tomography were used to generate digital molar reconstructions at 50 to 80 micron voxel resolution, each crown represented by two to five million voxels. Surface data of both enamel dentine junction (EDJ) and outer enamel were extracted to derive volumetric measures, surface areas, curvilinear distances, and whole crown radial thickness maps. Three-dimensional average enamel thickness (AET) was defined as enamel volume divided by EDJ surface area. In 3D AET relative to tooth size, Homo exhibited the thickest, Gorilla the thinnest, and Pan and Pongo intermediately thick enamel. This result differs from previous claims that molar enamel of Pongo is relatively thicker than that of Pan. The discrepancy between three and two-dimensional (2D) values of AET stems from a combination of local differences in within tooth enamel distribution pattern and EDJ topography between Pan and Pongo molars. It demonstrates that 2D AET is not an appropriate substitute or estimator of whole crown AET. Examination of whole crown 3D distributions of molar enamel revealed a pattern common to all four examined species, the ""functional"" side of the molar having thicker enamel than the opposite side. However, some unique aspects of each species were also apparent. While the Gorilla molar has relatively thin enamel throughout its crown, Pan molars are characterized by particularly thin enamel in the occlusal fovea, and Pongo molars by an accentuation of relatively thin basal and thick occlusal enamel. Human molars are characterized by relatively thick enamel throughout the crown, with relatively large contrasts between buccal and lingual, and between mesial and distal crown portions. The ancestral condition common to the four extant species can be estimated by interpreting molar enamel distribution patterns unique to each genus as likely to be derived. We hypothesize that the last common ancestor likely had intermediately thick enamel, without particular thickening (or thinning) of enamel either occlusally or basally.","Enamel thickness; Evolution; Hominoid; Molar","animal tissue; ape; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; enamel; human; human tissue; molar tooth; nonhuman; review; surface property; tooth crown",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-9144271168

Paleoanthropologists employ enamel thickness in paleodietary and taxonomic studies regarding earlier hominins, but variation in enamel thickness within the genus Homo has not been thoroughly explored despite its potential to discriminate species and its relevance to studies of growth and development. Radiographic two-dimensional studies indicate that Neandertal molar enamel is thin relative to the thick enamel of modern humans, although such methods have limited accuracy. Here we show that, measured via accurate high-resolution microtomographic imaging, Neandertal molar enamel is absolutely and relatively thinner than modern human enamel at most molar positions. However, this difference relates to the ratio of coronal dentine volume to total crown volume, rather than the quantity of enamel per se. The absolute volume of Neandertal molar enamel is similar to that of modern humans, but Neandertal enamel is deposited over a larger volume of coronal dentine, resulting in lower average (and relative) enamel thickness values. Sample sizes do not permit rigorous intragroup comparisons, but Neandertal molar tissue proportions evince less variation than the modern human sample. Differences in three- and two-dimensional enamel thickness data describing Neandertal molars may be explained by dimensional reduction. Although molar tissue proportions distinguish Neanderthals from recent Homo sapiens, additional study is necessary to assess trends in tissue proportions in the genus Homo throughout the Pleistocene. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The method estimates an anatomical model, the template complex, that is representative of the population under study. Its shape reflects anatomical invariants within the dataset. In addition, the method automatically places control points near the most variable parts of the template complex. Vectors attached to these points are parameters of deformations of the ambient 3D space. These deformations warp the template to each subject's complex in a way that preserves the organization of the anatomical structures. Multivariate statistical analysis is applied to these deformation parameters to test for group differences. Results of the statistical analysis are then expressed in terms of deformation patterns of the template complex, and can be visualized and interpreted. The user needs only to specify the topology of the template complex and the number of control points. The method then automatically estimates the shape of the template complex, the optimal position of control points and deformation parameters. The proposed approach is completely generic with respect to any type of application and well adapted to efficient use in clinical studies, in that it does not require point correspondence across surfaces and is robust to mesh imperfections such as holes, spikes, inconsistent orientation or irregular meshing.The approach is illustrated with a neuroimaging study of Down syndrome (DS). The results demonstrate that the complex of deep brain structures shows a statistically significant shape difference between control and DS subjects. The deformation-based modelingis able to classify subjects with very high specificity and sensitivity, thus showing important generalization capability even given a low sample size. We show that the results remain significant even if the number of control points, and hence the dimension of variables in the statistical model, are drastically reduced. The analysis may even suggest that parsimonious models have an increased statistical performance.The method has been implemented in the software Deformetrica, which is publicly available at www.deformetrica.org. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Anatomy; Deformation; Morphometry; Shape; Statistics; Varifold","anatomic model; anatomical concepts; article; calculation; clinical article; controlled study; dense deformation; Down syndrome; first cervical vertebra; human; kernel method; mathematical computing; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; neuroimaging; nonlinear system; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; process optimization; sample size; sensitivity and specificity; sparse parameter; statistical model; statistical parameters; statistical significance; template complex; validation process; anatomy and histology; audiovisual equipment; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; statistical analysis; Brain; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Down Syndrome; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Models, Anatomic; Neuroimaging; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904515284

An understanding of the interspecific and intraspecific variation in extant nonhuman primate trabecular structure is needed to evaluate its usefulness as a tool to reconstruct the locomotor habits of extinct primates. High-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT) is a new imaging approach with a resolution in the tens of microns that allows nondestructive access to the internal structure of bony elements. Previous studies indicate that such resolution is necessary to accurately quantify structural parameters of trabecular bone. The primary goal of this study was to test the accuracy of HRXCT by comparing stereological measurements from HRXCT images and histological thin sections of cancellous bone taken from the proximal femur and humerus of baboons. To this end, 11 bone samples were scanned on an HRXCT scanner and then thin-sectioned to reveal the scanned plane. HRXCT images were thresholded using a modified half-maximum height protocol. The stereological measurements included bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), bone surface to volume ratio (BS/BV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp). The measurement errors on the HRXCT images were 10.90% for BV/TV, 6.06% for Tb.N, 14.19% for BS/BV, 14.33% for Tb.Th, and 7.09% for Tb.Sp, but none of these measurements were significantly different from the histological standards (α = 0.05). A second goal of this study was to examine the influence of thresholding, a necessary step in any morphometric study using computed tomography, on the accuracy of the quantitative morphometry. Threshold values derived from a modified half-maximum height protocol showed that parameters derived from the region of interest (area in which stereological measurements were later taken) produced better reconstructions of the actual bone structure than threshold values derived from more inclusive areas of bone. We conclude that HRXCT can accurately reconstruct the complex architecture of trabecular bone, and that thresholding is a nontrivial step in trabecular bone studies, with even slight changes in the protocol greatly affecting the morphometric data. HRXCT represents a valuable analytical tool that should be of interest to a great many researchers in physical anthropology because it allows nondestructive access to internal morphology, thereby preserving valuable and limited skeletal collections. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","High-resolution X-ray computed tomography; Primate trabecular bone; Stereology; Thresholding","accuracy; animal tissue; article; baboon; high resolution computer tomography; histology; image analysis; morphometrics; nonhuman; primate; stereology; trabecular bone; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Biomechanics; Femur; Humerus; Locomotion; Papio; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036223539

We present a comparison of the expression of lower molar dental traits (cusp 6, cusp 7, trigonid crest pattern, and protostylid) at the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) in a variety of extant and fossil hominoid taxa, in order to assess the contribution of the EDJ to the morphology of these traits at the outer enamel surface (OES). Molars (n = 44) were imaged nondestructively using high-resolution microCT, and three-dimensional surface models of the EDJ and OES were created to compare trait expression at each surface. Our results indicate that these dental traits originate at the EDJ, and that the EDJ is primarily responsible for their degree of expression at the OES. Importantly, variable trait morphology at the EDJ (often not easily recognizable at the OES) indicates that different developmental processes can produce traits that appear similar at the enamel surface, suggesting caution in intra- and intertaxonomic comparisons. The results also highlight the importance of the EDJ for understanding the morphological development of discrete traits, and for establishing graded scales of variation to compare trait frequency among groups for the purpose of taxonomic and/or phylogenetic analysis. Finally, this study demonstrates that imaging the EDJ of both worn and unworn fossil hominin teeth provides a novel source of information about tooth development and variation in crown morphology. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, since its first excavations over 70 years ago, detailed studies of processes responsible for the accumulation of anthropogenic and geogenic sediments in the site have been sparse. This paper provides some details of site formation processes mainly through field observations of the extant section at Locality 1, and the use of soil micromorphology and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) analyses of the sediments. Samples from Layers 10 through 3 show extensive water deposition of fine silt-sized material (reworked loess), including fine-grained organic matter. The dark organic-rich unit in Layer 10-often cited as one of the earliest evidence of fire-is a water-laid accumulation. Much of the fine-grained sediment was derived from outside Locality 1, implying that the site was open to varying extents throughout most of its depositional history. The 4-6 m accumulation of ""ashes"" in Layer 4 represents subaerial water-laid silt deposits derived from the loess-covered hillslopes surrounding the site. They presumably accumulated in an open depression that formed after the collapse of the brecciated roof deposits represented by Layer 6. Diagenesis is present in many of the Layers, and is exemplified by calcite precipitation and dissoulution, and localized apatite (dahllite) replacement of calcite. In Layer 4 diagenesis is more advanced, including calcite/dahllite precipitation, subaerial weathering of the loess and associated precipitation of hematite, alteration of clay and the neoformation of quartz. Many of our conclusions concur with those of Teilhard de Chardin and Young published over 70 years ago.","Diagenesis; Fire use; Geoarchaeology; Micromorphology; Prehistory","archaeology; diagenesis; fire; human activity; micromorphology; soil analysis; China; Hubei Province; Zhoukoudian",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035156702

Recent debate focused on the age of the oldest Javanese hominids, but the argument so far includes little morphological basis for the fossils. To approach these questions, we analyzed a comprehensive dentognathic sample from Sangiran, which includes most of the existing hominid mandibles and teeth from the Early Pleistocene of Java. The sample was divided into chronologically younger and older groups. We examined morphological differences between these chronological groups, and investigated their affinities with other hominid groups from Africa and Eurasia. The results indicated that 1) there are remarkable morphological differences between the chronologically younger and older groups of Java, 2) the chronologically younger group is morphologically advanced, showing a similar degree of dentognathic reduction to that of Middle Pleistocene Chinese H. erectus, and 3) the chronologically older group exhibits some features that are equally primitive as or more primitive than early H. erectus of Africa. These findings suggest that the evolutionary history of early Javanese H. erectus was more dynamic than previously thought. Coupled with recent discoveries of the earliest form of H. erectus from Dmanisi, Georgia, the primitive aspects of the oldest Javanese hominid remains suggest that hominid groups prior to the grade of ca. 1.8-1.5 Ma African early H. erectus dispersed into eastern Eurasia during the earlier Early Pleistocene, although the age of the Javanese hominids themselves is yet to be resolved. Subsequent periods of the Early Pleistocene witnessed remarkable changes in the Javanese hominid record, which are ascribed either to significant in situ evolution or replacement of populations. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","H. erectus; Hominid evolution; Java; Mandible; Meganthropus; Pleistocene; Teeth","Africa; article; chronology; dentistry; evolution; genetic variability; history of medicine; hominid; human; Indonesia; Lower Pleistocene; Pleistocene; taxonomic identification; Adult; Animals; Child; Evolution; Female; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Indonesia; Male; Mandible; Paleodontology; Sex Characteristics; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-27144511731

This study examined variation in trigonid crest patterns on the enamel and dentine surfaces to (1) evaluate the concordance between the morphology of trigonid crests at the inner dentine and the outer enamel surfaces; (2) examine their developmental origin(s); and (3) examine trait polarity through comparison with Australopithecus africanus and Pan. The sample included 73 H. neanderthalensis, 67 contemporary H. sapiens, 5 A. africanus, and 24 Pan lower molars. Results indicate general agreement in the morphology observed on the dentine and enamel surfaces. All but one H. neanderthalensis molar shows some trigonid crest development, whereas trigonid crests occur in low frequency in contemporary humans. Pan and A. africanus both also show high frequencies of a continuous trigonid crest. However, the origin of the trigonid crest differs among groups. H. neanderthalensis uniquely possesses a 'middle' trigonid crest that originates from the mesial accessory ridge of one or both cusps. Based on our results we suggest that presence of a continuous middle trigonid crest at the dentine surface is primitive and the lack of any trigonid crest is derived. Genetic drift may explain the high frequency of trigonid crests in H.neanderthalensis. However, H. neanderthalensis still appears to be derived relative to Pan and A. africanus in its high frequency of the mesial-mesial trigonid crest configuration.

This reduces the size of samples available for study. The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) is the developmental precursor and primary contributor to the morphology of the unworn outer enamel surface, and its morphology is only affected after considerable attrition. In this paper, we explore whether the form of the EDJ can be used to distinguish between the mandibular molars of two southern African fossil hominins: Paranthropus (or Australopithecus) robustus and Australopithecus africanus. After micro-computed tomographic scanning the molar sample, we made high-resolution images of the EDJ and used geometric morphometrics to compare EDJ shape differences between species, in addition to documenting metameric variation along the molar row within each species. Landmarks were collected along the marginal ridge that runs between adjacent dentine horns and around the circumference of the cervix. Our results suggest that the morphology of the EDJ can distinguish lower molars of these southern African hominins, and it can discriminate first, second, and third molars within each taxon. These results confirm previous findings that the EDJ preserves taxonomically valuable shape information in worn teeth. Mean differences in EDJ shape, in particular dentine horn height, crown height, and cervix shape, are more marked between adjacent molars within each taxon than for the same molar between the two taxa. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, there is little known about variation in molar root morphology in Neanderthals and other recent and fossil members of Homo. Here, we provide the first comprehensive metric analysis of permanent mandibular molar root morphology in Middle and Late Pleistocene Homo neanderthalensis, and Late Pleistocene (Aterian) and recent Homo sapiens. We specifically address the question of whether root form can be used to distinguish between these groups and assess whether any variation in root form can be related to differences in tooth function. We apply a microtomographic imaging approach to visualise and quantify the external and internal dental morphologies of both isolated molars and molars embedded in the mandible (n=127). Univariate and multivariate analyses reveal both similarities (root length and pulp volume) and differences (occurrence of pyramidal roots and dental tissue volume proportion) in molar root morphology among penecontemporaneous Neanderthals and Aterian H. sapiens. In contrast, the molars of recent H. sapiens are markedly smaller than both Pleistocene H. sapiens and Neanderthals, but share with the former the dentine volume reduction and a smaller root-to-crown volume compared with Neanderthals. Furthermore, we found the first molar to have the largest average root surface area in recent H. sapiens and Neanderthals, although in the latter the difference between M1 and M2 is small. In contrast, Aterian H. sapiens root surface areas peak at M2. Since root surface area is linked to masticatory function, this suggests a distinct occlusal loading regime in Neanderthals compared with both recent and Pleistocene H. sapiens. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Aterian Homo sapiens; Dental morphology; Homo neanderthalensis; Microtomography; Taurodontism; Tooth function","human evolution; imaging method; morphology; morphometry; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; tomography; tooth; visualization; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958189205

However, little is known about enamel thickness in the earliest members of the genus Homo, and recent studies of later Homo report considerable intra- and inter-specific variation. In order to assess taxonomic, geographic, and temporal trends in enamel thickness, we applied micro-computed tomographic imaging to 150 fossil Homo teeth spanning two million years. Early Homo postcanine teeth from Africa and Asia show highly variable average and relative enamel thickness (AET and RET) values. Three molars from South Africa exceed Homo AET and RET ranges, resembling the hyper thick Paranthropus condition. Most later Homo groups (archaic European and north African Homo, and fossil and recent Homo sapiens) possess absolutely and relatively thick enamel across the entire dentition. In contrast, Neanderthals show relatively thin enamel in their incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, although incisor AET values are similar to H. sapiens. Comparisons of recent and fossil H. sapiens reveal that dental size reduction has led to a disproportionate decrease in coronal dentine compared with enamel (although both are reduced), leading to relatively thicker enamel in recent humans. General characterizations of hominins as having 'thick enamel' thus oversimplify a surprisingly variable craniodental trait with limited taxonomic utility within a genus. Moreover, estimates of dental attrition rates employed in paleodemographic reconstruction may be biased when this variation is not considered. Additional research is necessary to reconstruct hominin dietary ecology since thick enamel is not a prerequisite for hard-object feeding, and it is present in most later Homo species despite advances in technology and food processing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaic Homo; Dental morphology; Early Homo; Hominin tooth structure; Human evolution; Neanderthal","enamel; fossil record; human evolution; morphology; Neanderthal; tomography; Asia; South Africa; Homo sapiens; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; Paranthropus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858071926

Despite a long history of study and characterization of Paranthropus molars as relatively 'hyper-thick', only a few tooth fragments and controlled planes of section (designed to be proxies of whole-crown thickness) have been measured. Here, we measure molar enamel thickness in Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus using accurate microtomographic methods, recording the whole-crown distribution of enamel. Both taxa have relatively thick enamel, but are thinner than previously characterized based on two-dimensional measurements. Three-dimensional measurements show that P. robustus enamel is not hyper-thick, and A. africanus enamel is relatively thinner than that of recent humans. Interspecific differences in the whole-crown distribution of enamel thickness influence cross-sectional measurements such that enamel thickness is exaggerated in two-dimensional sections of A. africanus and P. robustus molars. As such, two-dimensional enamel thickness measurements in australopiths are not reliable proxies for the three-dimensional data they are meant to represent. The three-dimensional distribution of enamel thickness shows different patterns among species, and is more useful for the interpretation of functional adaptations than single summary measures of enamel thickness. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Enamel distribution; Hominin evolution; Microtomography","dentition; enamel; evolution; fossil; hominid; measurement method; tomography; accuracy; article; australopithecus; Australopithecus africanus; enamel; microtomography; molar tooth; nonhuman; Paranthropus; Paranthropus robustus; physiology; priority journal; thickness; three dimensional imaging; tomography; Australopithecus; Australopithecus africanus; Paranthropus; Paranthropus robustus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-46949098557

In contrast, the paucity of hominin fossil evidence from East Asia from this period impedes a complete evolutionary picture of the genus Homo, as well as assessment of the possible contribution of or interaction with Asian hominins in the evolution of Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis. Here we present a comparative study of a hominin dental sample recovered from the Xujiayao site, in Northern China, attributed to the early Late Pleistocene (MIS 5 to 4). Our dental study reveals a mosaic of primitive and derived dental features for the Xujiayao hominins that can be summarized as follows: i) they are different from archaic and recent modern humans, ii) they present some features that are common but not exclusive to the Neanderthal lineage, and iii) they retain some primitive conformations classically found in East Asian Early and Middle Pleistocene hominins despite their young geological age. Thus, our study evinces the existence in China of a population of unclear taxonomic status with regard to other contemporary populations such as H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis. The morphological and metric studies of the Xujiayao teeth expand the variability known for early Late Pleistocene hominin fossils and suggest the possibility that a primitive hominin lineage may have survived late into the Late Pleistocene in China. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Dental variability; Fossil; Mosaic; Teeth","Article; China; comparative anatomy; controlled study; East Asian; evolution; fossil hominin; Homo neanderthalensis; human; human tissue; micro-computed tomography; Middle Pleistocene; molar tooth; premolar tooth; tooth; Upper Pleistocene; anatomy and histology; animals; Fossils; history; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Paleodontology; Tooth; Animals; China; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Paleodontology; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920774451

Although significant changes in craniofacial and postcranial morphology have been found between the Middle Paleolithic and earlier Upper Paleolithic modern humans of western Eurasia and the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene inhabitants of the same region, most studies of dental maturation and structural morphology have compared Neandertals only to later Holocene humans. To assess whether earlier modern humans contrasted with later modern populations and possibly approached the Neandertal pattern, we used high-resolution microtomography to analyze the remarkably complete mixed dentition of the early Upper Paleolithic (Gravettian) child from Abrigo do Lagar Velho, Portugal, and compared it to a Neandertal sample, the late Upper Paleolithic (Magdalenian) child of La Madeleine, and a worldwide extant human sample.Some aspects of the dental maturational pattern and tooth endostructural organization of Lagar Velho 1 are absent from extant populations and the Magdalenian specimen and are currently documented only among Neandertals. Therefore, a simple Neandertal versus modern human dichotomy is inadequate to accommodate the morphostructural and developmental variation represented by Middle Paleolithic and earlier Upper Paleolithic populations. These data reinforce the complex nature of Neandertal-modern human similarities and differences, and document ongoing human evolution after the global establishment of modern human morphology.","Dentition; Development; Modern humans; Neandertal; Pleistocene","article; child; comparative study; extant species; human; human tissue; maturation; modern times; morphology; Paleolithic; Portugal; priority journal; tooth development; Anthropology, Physical; Bayes Theorem; Child; Evolution; Female; Humans; Male; Portugal; Tooth",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-76549103471

It is a matter of controversy whether this primitive form, dated to the Late Pleistocene, evolved from early Asian Homo erectus and represents a unique and striking case of evolutionary reversal in hominin body and brain size within an insular environment. The alternative hypothesis is that H. floresiensis derived from an older, smaller-brained member of our genus, such as Homo habilis, or perhaps even late Australopithecus, signalling a hitherto undocumented dispersal of hominins from Africa into eastern Asia by two million years ago (2 Ma). Here we describe hominin fossils excavated in 2014 from an early Middle Pleistocene site (Mata Menge) in the So'a Basin of central Flores. These specimens comprise a mandible fragment and six isolated teeth belonging to at least three small-jawed and small-toothed individuals. Dating to ∼0.7 Ma, these fossils now constitute the oldest hominin remains from Flores. The Mata Menge mandible and teeth are similar in dimensions and morphological characteristics to those of H. floresiensis from Liang Bua. The exception is the mandibular first molar, which retains a more primitive condition. Notably, the Mata Menge mandible and molar are even smaller in size than those of the two existing H. floresiensis individuals from Liang Bua. The Mata Menge fossils are derived compared with Australopithecus and H. habilis, and so tend to support the view that H. floresiensis is a dwarfed descendent of early Asian H. erectus. Our findings suggest that hominins on Flores had acquired extremely small body size and other morphological traits specific to H. floresiensis at an unexpectedly early time. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Additional evidence comes from the Danakil Depression of Eritrea, where over 200 late Early to early Middle Pleistocene sites have been identified within a ~1000m-thick sedimentary succession outcropping in the Dandiero Rift Basin, near Buia. Along with an adult cranium (UA 31), which displays a blend of H.erectus-like and derived morpho-architectural features and three pelvic remains, two isolated permanent incisors (UA 222 and UA 369) have also been recovered from the 1Ma (millions of years ago) Homo-bearing outcrop of Uadi Aalad. Since 2010, our surveys have expanded to the nearby (4.7km) site of Mulhuli-Amo (MA). This is a fossiliferous area that has been preliminarily surveyed because of its exceptional concentration of Acheulean stone tools. So far, the site has yielded 10 human remains, including the unworn crown of a lower permanent molar (MA 93). Using diverse analytical tools (including high resolution μCT and μMRI), we analysed the external and internal macromorphology and microstructure of the three specimens, and whenever possible compared the results with similar evidence from early Homo, H.erectus s.l., H.antecessor, H.heidelbergensis (from North Africa), Neanderthals and modern humans. We also assessed the UA 369 lower incisor from Uadi Aalad for root completion timing and showed that it compares well with data for root apex closure in modern human populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Buia; East Africa; External morphology; Homo erectus/ergaster; Internal structure; Teeth","archaeological evidence; enamel; fossil record; hominid; morphology; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; taxonomy; East Africa; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis; anatomy and histology; animal; Eritrea; fossil; hominid; incisor; micro-computed tomography; molar tooth; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radiography; Animals; Eritrea; Fossils; Hominidae; Incisor; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Molar; X-Ray Microtomography",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906943197

Box 643, Beijing 100044, China","From a detailed analysis of published and unpublished sources, we constructed a digitized three-dimensional, stratigraphically-controlled excavation grid of Zhoukoudian Locality 1 in order to assess the spatial relationships of the excavated materials. All 15 fossil Homo erectus loci were mapped on the grid. Meter cubes were used in excavation starting in 1934, and Loci H through O, established between 1934 and 1937, were mapped to within 1 m3 vertical and horizontal provenience. Loci A through G, established between 1921 and 1933, were excavated in the northernmost part of Locality 1 by unmapped quarrying, but their stratigraphic levels were recorded. We could localize Loci A through G on the grid system by utilizing locations of remaining walls, stratigraphic sections, excavation reports, excavation maps, and photographs. Loci contained skeletal elements of Homo erectus individuals scattered over areas of the cave floor of up to 9 m in diameter. Scoring of taphonomic damage on the Homo erectus sample, as observed on casts and originals, demonstrates that 67% of the hominid sample shows bite marks or other modifications ascribed to large mammalian carnivores, particularly the large Pleistocene cave hyena, Pachycrocuta brevirostris. Virtually all of the remaining Homo erectus skeletal assemblage shows breakage consistent with this taphonomic pattern of fragmentation. Bioturbation by digging carnivores is the most likely explanation for a fragment of Homo erectus Skull XI discovered 1 m below its other conjoined portions in Locus L. Carbon on all the Homo erectus fossils from Locus G, a circumscribed area of 1-meter diameter, earlier taken to indicate burning, cooking, and cannibalism, is here interpreted as detrital carbon deposited under water, perhaps the result of hyaenid caching behavior. Locus G records the close stratigraphic and horizontal association of stone artifacts with Homo erectus and other vertebrate skeletal elements, an association that is seen at other loci as well. Layer 4 of the excavation contains equid cranial bone previously interpreted to have been burned while fresh. We here document that Locus B Homo erectus, including Skull I, is stratigraphically associated with this evidence, but at some 10-12 m distance. Even though the presence of wood-stoked fires and hearths is not supported by geochemical results, evidence of fire at Locality 1 in the form of burned bone is confirmed. Contextual relationships of fossil skeletal elements, relationships of carnivore damage and stone tool cutmarks on bone, and evidence of the burning of fresh bone associated with Homo erectus and stone tools support a model of transient hominid scavenging aided by the use of fire at the large hyenid den that became Zhoukoudian Locality 1. Although the original excavation catalogue from Locality 1, as well as a significant number of fossils and stone artifacts, were lost during World War II, catalogue numbers on the many surviving specimens can be used to locate fossils and artifacts within the three-dimensional grid provided in this paper. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we present an examination of trigonid crest patterning in the Middle Pleistocene permanent lower molar sample (n=62) of Homo heidelbergensis from Sima de los Huesos (SH). Crest expression was assessed from 3D models of the enamel and the dentine surfaces that were produced using micro-computed tomography (microCT). The aims of our analysis are to: 1) characterize the pattern of trigonid crest expression at the outer enamel and enamel-dentine junction surfaces (OES and EDJ) of the SH sample, 2) evaluate the concordance of expression between both surfaces, and 3) place trigonid crest variation in the SH sample into a phylogenetic context. Our results reveal a greater variability in the expression of trigonid crests at the EDJ (14 types) compared to the OES (4 types). Despite this variability, in almost all cases the expression of a continuous mid-trigonid or distal crest at the OES corresponds with the expression of a continuous mesial/mid-trigonid or distal trigonid crest, respectively, at the EDJ. Thus, it is possible to predict the type of trigonid crest pattern that would be at the OES in the case of partially worn teeth. Our study points to increased variability in trigonid crest expression in M3s compared to M1s and M2s. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the SH sample matches broadly the trigonid crest patterns displayed by H.neanderthalensis and differs from those exhibited by H.sapiens, particularly in the almost constant expression of a continuous middle trigonid crest at the EDJ. However, SH hominins also exhibit patterns that have not been reported in H.neanderthalensis and H.sapiens samples. Other aspects of the variability of the trigonid crest expression at the dentine are presented and discussed. © 2013 Académie des sciences.","Homo heidelbergensis; Homo neanderthalensis; Homo sapiens; Microtomography; Permanent lower molars; Sima de los Huesos; Trigonid crest patterns","enamel; fossil; fossil record; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; tomography; tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896704861

The present study provides the first detailed morphometric description and comparisons of four hominin teeth (I1, C1, P3 and P3) from this site. Our study shows that the Panxian Dadong teeth combine archaic and derived features that align them with Middle and Upper Pleistocene fossils from East and West Asia and Europe. These teeth do not display any typical Neanderthal features and they are generally more derived than other contemporaneous populations from Asia and Africa. However, the derived traits are not diagnostic enough to specifically link the Panxian Dadong teeth to Homo sapiens, a common problem when analyzing the Middle Pleistocene dental record from Africa and Asia.

We utilize a methodology based on smooth and invertible deformations combined with a metric of "" currents"" that defines a distance between endocranial surfaces and does not rely on correspondence between landmarks. This allows us to perform a temporal surface regression that estimates typical endocranial ontogenetic trajectories separately for bonobos and chimpanzees. We highlight non-linear patterns of endocranial ontogenetic change and significant differences between species at local anatomical levels rather than considering the endocranium as a uniform entity. A spatiotemporal registration permits the quantification of inter-species differences decomposed into a morphological deformation (accounting for size and shape differences independently of age) and a time warp (accounting for changes in the dynamics of development). Our statistical simulations suggest that patterns of endocranial volume (EV) increase may differ significantly between bonobos and chimpanzees, with an earlier phase of a relatively rapid increase (preferentially at some endocranial subdivisions) in the former and a much later phase of relatively rapid increase in the latter. As a consequence, the chimpanzee endocranium appears to reach its adult size later. Moreover, the time warp indicates that juvenile bonobos develop much slower than juvenile chimpanzees, suggesting that inter-specific ontogenetic shifts do not only concern EV increase, but also the rate of shape changes over time. Our method provides, for the first time, a quantitative estimation of inter-specific ontogenetic shifts that appear to differentiate non-linearly. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Endocranium; Ontogeny; Pan; Shape regression; Spatiotemporal registration; Virtual anthropology","comparative study; cranium; dentition; morphology; ontogeny; primate; quantitative analysis; regression analysis; Pan; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855191994

This technique, widely developed in the medical field, allows the bi-dimensional, planar representation of some local morphometric properties, i.e., topographic thickness variation, of a three-dimensional object, such as a long bone shaft. Nonetheless, the use of morphometric maps is still limited in (paleo)anthropology, and their feasibility has not been adequately tested on fossil specimens. Using high-resolution microtomographic images, here we apply bi-dimensional virtual ""unrolling"" and synthetic thickness mapping techniques to compare cortical bone topographic variation across the shaft in a modern and a fossil human adult femur (the Magdalenian from Chancelade). We also test, for the first time, the possibility to virtually unroll and assess for dentine thickness variation in modern and fossil (the Neanderthal child from Roc de Marsal) human deciduous tooth roots. The analyses demonstrate the feasibility of using two-dimensional morphometric maps for the synthetic functional imaging and comparative biomechanical interpretation of cortical bone thickness variation in extant and fossil specimens and show the interest of using this technique also for the subtle characterization of root architecture and dentine topography. More specifically, our preliminary results support the use of virtual cartography as a tool for assessing to what extent internal root morphology is capable of responding to loading and directional stresses and strains in a predictable way. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cortical bone; Microtomography; Morphometric maps; Root dentine; Thickness variation","article; cortical bone; femur; fossil; human; image display; paleoanthropology; three dimensional imaging; tooth root; Adult; Child, Preschool; Dentin; Femur; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Organ Size; Paleodontology; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Tooth Root",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952774740

Sangiran is the source for more than 80 specimens in deposits with 40Ar/39Ar ages of 1.51-0.9 Ma. In April 2001, we recovered a H. erectus left maxilla fragment (preserving P3- M2) from the Sangiran site of Bapang. The find spot lies at the base of the Bapang Formation type section in cemented gravelly sands traditionally called the Grenzbank Zone. Two meters above the find spot, pumice hornblende has produced an 40Ar/39Ar age of 1.51 ± 0.08 Ma. With the addition of Bpg 2001.04, Sangiran now has five H. erectus maxillae. We compare the new maxilla with homologs representing Sangiran H. erectus, Zhoukoudian H. erectus, Western H. erectus (pooled African and Georgian specimens), and Homo habilis. Greatest contrast is with the Zhoukoudian maxillae, which appear to exhibit a derived pattern of premolar-molar relationships compared to Western and Sangiran H. erectus. The dental patterns suggest distinct demic origins for the earlier H. erectus populations represented at Sangiran and the later population represented at Zhoukoudian.

Among this sample, only one of the specimens had already been briefly described, with the other fourteen remaining unreported. Seven of the fifteen isolated teeth were found in a secured stratigraphic context in the late Lower-early Middle Pleistocene Kabuh Formation. The remaining elements were surface finds which, based on coincidental sources of information, were inferred as coming from the Kabuh Formation. Mainly constituted of permanent molars, but also including one upper incisor and one upper premolar, this dental sample brings additional evidence for a marked degree of size variation and time-related structural reduction in Javanese H. erectus. This is notably expressed by a significant decrease of the mesiodistal diameter, frequently associated to the reduction or even loss of the lower molar distal cusp (hypoconulid) and to a more square occlusal outline. In addition to the hypoconulid reduction or loss, this new sample also exhibits a low frequency of the occlusal Y-groove pattern, with a dominance of the X and, to a lesser extent, of the+patterns. This combination is rare in the Lower and early Middle Pleistocene paleoanthropological record, including in the early Javanese dental assemblage from the Sangiran Dome. On the other hand, similar dental features are found in Chinese H. erectus and in H. heidelbergensis. As a whole, this new record confirms the complex nature of the intermittent exchanges that occurred between continental and insular Southeast Asia through the Pleistocene. © 2013 Clément Zanolli.",,"anatomical variation; article; dental cusp; fossil human; human; human tissue; incisor; Indonesia; Middle Pleistocene; molar tooth; premolar tooth; tooth crown; Fossils; Geography; Humans; Indonesia; Paleodontology; Tooth Crown",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879765922

While previous studies have focused on the cranial remains, there are no detailed analyses of the dental evidence. In this study, we provide metric and morphological descriptions and comparisons of ten teeth recovered from Hexian, including microcomputed tomography analyses. Our results indicate that the Hexian teeth are metrically and morphologically primitive and overlap with H. ergaster and East Asian Early and mid-Middle Pleistocene hominins in their large dimensions and occlusal complexities. However, the Hexian teeth differ from H. ergaster in features such as conspicuous vertical grooves on the labial/buccal surfaces of the central incisor and the upper premolar, the crown outline shapes of upper and lower molars and the numbers, shapes, and divergences of the roots. Despite their close geological ages, the Hexian teeth are also more primitive than Zhoukoudian specimens, and resemble Sangiran Early Pleistocene teeth. In addition, no typical Neanderthal features have been identified in the Hexian sample. Our study highlights the metrical and morphological primitive status of the Hexian sample in comparison to contemporaneous or even earlier populations of Asia. Based on this finding, we suggest that the primitive-derived gradients of the Asian hominins cannot be satisfactorily fitted along a chronological sequence, suggesting complex evolutionary scenarios with the coexistence and/or survival of different lineages in Eurasia. Hexian could represent the persistence in time of a H. erectus group that would have retained primitive features that were lost in other Asian populations such as Zhoukoudian or Panxian Dadong. Our study expands the metrical and morphological variations known for the East Asianhominins before the mid-Middle Pleistocene and warns about the possibility that the Asian hominin variability may have been taxonomically oversimplified.

In this study, the degree of dental reduction in the former was examined by comparing their postcanine crown size with that of various regional groups of recent H. sapiens. The results show that overall crown size and degree of posterior molar reduction of Javanese H. erectus of the late Early Pleistocene was within the range of variation of recent H. sapiens. The position of this H. erectus group in the general trend of dental reduction in Early to Middle Pleistocene Asian archaic Homo is discussed. Implications for the phylogenetic discontinuity hypothesis between H. erectus and H. sapiens in Australasia are presented. In contrast to their reduced crown size, the Javanese H. erectus remains exhibit robust root systems, presumably a primitive retention. This observation indicates that reduction in crown size preceded reduction of the roots during evolution of Homo, at least in the Sunda region. © 2005 The Anthropological Society of Nippon.","Dental reduction; Homo erectus; Root morphology; Sangiran; Tooth size",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645881066

The previous study of their external characteristics confirmed the degree of time-related structural reduction occurred in Javanese H. erectus, and also revealed a combination of nonmetric features which are rare in the Lower and early Middle Pleistocene dental record, but more frequently found in recent humans. In accordance with their outer occlusal morphology, the specimens exhibit a set of derived internal features, such as thick to hyperthick enamel, an incomplete expression of the crest patterns at the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) level, a sharp EDJ topography. As a whole, these features differ from those expressed in some penecontemporaneous specimens/samples representing African H. erectus/ ergaster and H. heidelbergensis, as well as in Neanderthals, but occur in recent human populations.

In subsequent years the interpretation of this fossil remained difficult for various reasons: (1) the lack of taxonomically diagnostic elements which would support its attribution to either Homo (sapiens) neanderthalensis or H. s. sapiens; (2) the absence of any reliable chronostratigraphic interpretation of the sedimentary sequence of the site; (3) the contradiction between archaeological interpretations, which attributed the lithic industry to a transitional facies between the Middle and Early Upper Palaeolithic, and the radiocarbon date of 46,820 ± 3,290 BP obtained from animal bone remains associated with the tooth and the flint tools. Thanks to recent progress regarding these three aspects, the tooth from Trou de l'Abîme may now be studied in detail. Analyses of the morphology and enamel thickness of the fossil yielded diagnostic characters consistent with an attribution to Neandertals. Re-examination of the lithic industry of Couvin shows that it corresponds to the late Middle Palaeolithic rather than a transitional facies. Furthermore, a new analysis of the site stratigraphy indicates that the unit situated above the archaeological layer in which the tooth was found is probably a palaeosol of brown soil type. Comparison with the regional cave sequences as well as with the reference sequence from the Belgian loess belt tends to show that the most recent palaeosol of this type is dated between 42,000 and 40,000 BP.

However, such a realization is still based on limited geographical occurrences mainly from Indonesia, China and Russian Altai. Here we describe a newly discovered archaic Homo mandible from Taiwan (Penghu 1), which further increases the diversity of Pleistocene Asian hominins. Penghu 1 revealed an unexpectedly late survival (younger than 450 but most likely 190-10 thousand years ago) of robust, apparently primitive dentognathic morphology in the periphery of the continent, which is unknown among the penecontemporaneous fossil records from other regions of Asia except for the mid-Middle Pleistocene Homo from Hexian, Eastern China. Such patterns of geographic trait distribution cannot be simply explained by clinal geographic variation of Homo erectus between northern China and Java, and suggests survival of multiple evolutionary lineages among archaic hominins before the arrival of modern humans in the region. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, to date, the majority of published data on molar enamel thickness of Pliocene and early Pleistocene hominins derive from naturally fractured random surfaces of a small number of specimens. In this study we systematically analyze enamel thickness in a large sample of Plio-Pleistocene fossil hominins (n=99), extant hominoids (n=57), and modern humans (n=30). Based on analysis of 2D mesial planes of section derived from microtomography, we examine both average and relative enamel thickness, and the distribution of enamel across buccal, occlusal, and lingual components of mandibular molars. Our results confirm the trend of increasing enamel thickness during the Pliocene that culminates in the thick enamel of the robust Australopithecus species, and then decreases from early Homo to recent modern humans. All hominin taxa share a regional average enamel thickness pattern of thick occlusal enamel and greater buccal than lingual enamel thickness. Pan is unique in exhibiting the thinnest average enamel thickness in the occlusal basin. Statistical analysis indicates that among Pliocene hominins enamel thickness is a weak taxonomic discriminator.

Similar structures also referred to as Carabelli's trait have been reported in apes and fossil hominins. However, the morphological development and homology of these mesiolingual structures among hominoids are poorly understood. In this study, we employ micro-computed tomography to image the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) and outer enamel surface (OES) of Pan (n = 48) and H. sapiens (n = 52) upper molars. We investigate the developmental origin of mesiolingual features in these taxa and establish the relative contribution of the EDJ and enamel cap to feature expression. Results demonstrate that mesiolingual features of H. sapiens molars develop at the EDJ and are similarly expressed at the OES. Morphological variation at both surfaces in this taxon can satisfactorily be assessed using standards for Carabelli's trait developed by the Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System (ASUDAS). Relative to H. sapiens, Pan has an even greater degree of correspondence in feature expression between the EDJ and OES. Morphological manifestations in Pan molars are not necessarily limited to the protocone and are best characterized by a lingual cingulum that cannot be captured by the ASUDAS. Cusp-like structures, similar to those seen in marked Carabelli's trait expressions in H. sapiens, were not found in Pan. This study provides a foundation for further analyses on the evolutionary history of mesiolingual dental traits within the hominoid lineage. It also highlights the wealth of morphological data that can be obtained at the EDJ for understanding tooth development and for characterizing tooth crown variation in worn fossil teeth. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accessory cusp; ASUDAS; Discrete dental traits; Lingual cingulum; Micro-computed tomography","dentition; enamel; fossil; hominid; homology; morphology; tomography; Hominoidea; Homo; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865862009

The carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of structural carbonate within the enamel of these teeth are used to reconstruct the paleodiet and paleoenvironment of the mammals. The δ13C values of enamel from Zhoukoudian range from -2.3‰ to -13.0‰, indicating that these mammals consumed between ∼25% and 100% C3 plants. The presence of significant amounts of C4 plants in the diets of some herbivore species indicates that at the onset of the Middle Pleistocene local habitats included mixed C3/C4 vegetation. By approximately 470,000 yr ago, C3 plants dominated the diets of herbivores studied, suggesting that the abundance of C4 flora had decreased in the area. For all deer analyzed in this study, the values of δ13C and δ18O decrease substantially from about 720,000 to 470,000 yr ago.

However, the accretion of the enamel cap yields thickness variations that alter the morphology and the topography of the enamel-dentine junction (i.e., the differential deposition of enamel by the ameloblasts create an external surface that does not necessarily perfectly parallel the enamel-dentine junction). This self-reliant influence of the enamel on tooth morphology is poorly understood and still under-investigated. Studies considering the relationship between enamel and dentine morphologies are rare, and none of them tackled this relationship in a quantitative way. Major limitations arose from: (1) the difficulties to characterize the tooth morphology in its comprehensive tridimensional aspect and (2) practical issues in relating enamel and enamel-dentine junction quantitative traits. We present new aspects of form representation based exclusively on 3D analytical tools and procedures. Our method is applied to a set of 21 unworn upper second molars belonging to eight extant anthropoid genera. Using geometrical analysis of polygonal meshes representatives of the tooth form, we propose a 3D dataset that constitutes a detailed characterization of the enamel and of the enamel-dentine junction morphologies. Also, for the first time, to our knowledge, we intend to establish a quantitative method for comparing enamel and enamel-dentine junction surfaces descriptors (elevation, inclination, orientation, etc.). New indices that allow characterizing the occlusal morphology are proposed and discussed. In this note, we present technical aspects of our method with the example of anthropoid molars. First results show notable individual variations and taxonomic heterogeneities for the selected topographic parameters and for the pattern and strength of association between enamel-dentine junction and enamel, the enamel cap altering in different ways the ""transcription"" of the enamel-dentine junction morphology. © 2013 Guy et al.",,"analytical parameters; article; controlled study; dentin; enamel; enamel thickness; human; image analysis; molar tooth; morphology; nonhuman; occlusal enamel dentine junction surface; occlusal enamel surface; occlusal relief index; primate; quantitative analysis; three dimensional imaging; tooth; tooth morphology; topography; Animals; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Primates; Tooth; Primates; Simiiformes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879477711

For two decades, I have supported and promoted the idea that Gigantopithecus and Homo erectus co-existed in the Early and Middle Pleistocene of China and Vietnam. With the discovery of a chimpanzee-sized ape co-occurring with Gigantopithecus at Mohui Cave, I realized that many of the claims for early hominins in the Stegodon-Ailuropoda faunas of southern China and Southeast Asia were likely incorrect. This calls for a reappraisal of the remains from the so-called “human” sites of this time period, namely Mohui, Longgupo, Jianshi, Sanhe, Lang Trang and Tham Khuyen, in the context of irrefutable hominin evidence from elsewhere in Asia. Therefore, the earliest hominin record from Asia is documented in the far north of China in the Nihewan Basin at sites such as Xiaochangliang and in the far south on Java at sites within the Sangiran Dome. By studying the unquestionable Homo erectus sites with significant cranial remains, such as Gongwangling (Shanxi province), Hexian (Anhui province) and Tangshan (Jiangsu province), we see a clear pattern. All of these sites are found north of the Stegodon-Ailuropoda fauna. Early hominins may very well have inhabited parts of southern China, such as in river valleys or areas devoid of forest, but they were not part of the heavily forested, humid-climate adapted Stegodon-Ailuropoda mammalian fauna of the region. Additional hominin research far to the north in China, or far to the south in Java, will provide important information and valuable insights into the potential dispersal routes of early Homo erectus out of Africa or Georgia and the habitats these earliest Asian immigrants preferred. © 2010, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Gigantopithecus; Homoerectus; Jianshi; Longgupo; Lufengpithecus; Mohui; Nihewan; Sangiran; Zhoukoudian; “Hemanthropus”",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045853346

In this respect, we can also expect that the general architecture of a tooth reflects a response to withstand the high stresses produced during masticatory loadings. Here we use an engineering approach, finite element analysis (FEA), with an advanced loading concept derived from individual occlusal wear information to evaluate whether some dental traits usually found in hominin and extant great ape molars, such as the trigonid crest, the entoconid-hypoconulid crest and the protostylid have important biomechanical implications. For this purpose, FEA was applied to 3D digital models of three Gorilla gorilla lower second molars (M2) differing in wear stages. Our results show that in unworn and slightly worn M2s tensile stresses concentrate in the grooves of the occlusal surface. In such condition, the trigonid and the entoconid-hypoconulid crests act to reinforce the crown locally against stresses produced along the mesiodistal groove. Similarly, the protostylid is shaped like a buttress to suffer the high tensile stresses concentrated in the deep buccal groove. These dental traits are less functional in the worn M2, because tensile stresses decrease physiologically in the crown with progressing wear due to the enlargement of antagonistic contact areas and changes in loading direction from oblique to nearly parallel direction to the dental axis. This suggests that the wear process might have a crucial influence in the evolution and structural adaptation of molars enabling to endure bite stresses and reduce tooth failure throughout the lifetime of an individual. © 2013 Benazzi et al.",,"alveolar bone; animal experiment; article; biomechanics; bone stress; controlled study; cortical bone; dentin; elasticity; enamel; entoconid hypoconulid crest; female; finite element analysis; gorilla; molar tooth; nonhuman; periodontal ligament; protostylid; thickness; tooth crown; tooth disease; tooth pulp; trigonid crest; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Cell Physiological Phenomena; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Follow-Up Studies; Glucose; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Mild Cognitive Impairment; Neural Networks (Computer); Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880761731

Usual methods for constructing a shape atlas require point correspondences across subjects, which are difficult in practice. By contrast, methods based on currents do not require correspondence. However, existing atlas construction methods using currents suffer from two limitations. First, the template current is not in the form of a topologically correct mesh, which makes direct analysis on shapes difficult. Second, the deformations are parametrized by vectors at the same location as the normals of the template current which often provides a parametrization that is more dense than required. In this paper, we propose a novel method for constructing shape atlases using currents where topology of the template is preserved and deformation parameters are optimized independently of the shape parameters. We use an L1 -type prior that enables us to adaptively compute sparse and low dimensional parameterization of deformations. We show an application of our method for comparing anatomical shapes of patients with Down’s syndrome and healthy controls, where the sparse parametrization of diffeomorphisms decreases the parameter dimension by one order of magnitude. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",,"Deformation; Maps; Medical computing; Population statistics; Topology; Anatomical shape; Atlas construction; Deformation parameter; Parametrization of diffeomorphisms; Parametrizations; Point correspondence; Shape parameters; Topology preserving; Medical imaging; algorithm; article; audiovisual equipment; automated pattern recognition; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; Down syndrome; human; image enhancement; methodology; pathology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Brain; Computer Simulation; Down Syndrome; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Models, Anatomic; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872918916

A broad range of potential explanations for the evolution of this species has been explored. One view is that H. floresiensis is derived from Asian Homo erectus that arrived on Flores and subsequently evolved a smaller body size, perhaps to survive the constrained resources they faced in a new island environment. Fossil remains of H. erectus, well known from Java, have not yet been discovered on Flores. The second hypothesis is that H. floresiensis is directly descended from an early Homo lineage with roots in Africa, such as Homo habilis; the third is that it is Homo sapiens with pathology. We use parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to test these hypotheses. Our phylogenetic data build upon those characters previously presented in support of these hypotheses by broadening the range of traits to include the crania, mandibles, dentition, and postcrania of Homo and Australopithecus. The new data and analyses support the hypothesis that H. floresiensis is an early Homo lineage: H. floresiensis is sister either to H. habilis alone or to a clade consisting of at least H. habilis, H. erectus, Homo ergaster, and H. sapiens. A close phylogenetic relationship between H. floresiensis and H. erectus or H. sapiens can be rejected; furthermore, most of the traits separating H. floresiensis from H. sapiens are not readily attributable to pathology (e.g., Down syndrome). The results suggest H. floresiensis is a long-surviving relict of an early (>1.75 Ma) hominin lineage and a hitherto unknown migration out of Africa, and not a recent derivative of either H. erectus or H. sapiens. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Australopithecus; Cladistic analysis; Flores hominins; Homo erectus; Homo floresiensis; Homo habilis","cladistics; cranium; dentition; fossil; hominid; paleontology; phylogenetics; skeletal remains; Africa; Australopithecus; Crania; Homo erectus; Homo ergaster; Homo floresiensis; Homo habilis; Homo sapiens; Africa; anatomy and histology; animal; Bayes theorem; classification; evolution; female; fossil; hominid; human; island (geological); phylogeny; skull; Africa; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Biological Evolution; Female; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Islands; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018641862

Results show that the magnetic susceptibility and redness of the burnt sediments are remarkably higher than those of other areas on the same level: up to ~22 times for magnetic susceptibility and ~3 times for redness of those of the adjacent unburnt sediments. Fine-grained (superparamagnetic/stable single-domain) magnetite and hematite grains make dominant contributions to the distinctly high values of magnetic susceptibility and redness in the burnt sediments. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy results show that the burnt sediments contain more hematite than those of other areas and localities 2 and 3. High-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrate that the burnt sediments have been heated above 700 °C. Those changes in low-frequency magnetic susceptibility and redness are impossibly resulted from natural fires, thus most likely signaling the human activities of controlled use of fire. However, further work is needed to confirm whether or not these heat-affected sediments were produced in situ. © 2014, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Magnetic susceptibility; Redness; Rock magnetism; Use of fire; Zhoukoudian",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943359947

The nature and evolutionary origins of H. floresiensis' unique physical characters have been intensively debated. Based on extensive comparisons using linear metric analyses, crown contour analyses, and other trait-by-trait morphological comparisons, we report here that the dental remains from multiple individuals indicate that H. floresiensis had primitive canine-premolar and advanced molar morphologies, a combination of dental traits unknown in any other hominin species. The primitive aspects are comparable to H. erectus from the Early Pleistocene, whereas some of the molar morphologies are more progressive even compared to those of modern humans. This evidence contradicts the earlier claim of an entirely modern human-like dental morphology of H. floresiensis, while at the same time does not support the hypothesis that H. floresiensis originated from a much older H. habilis or Australopithecus-like small-brained hominin species currently unknown in the Asian fossil record. These results are however consistent with the alternative hypothesis that H. floresiensis derived from an earlier Asian Homo erectus population and experienced substantial body and brain size dwarfism in an isolated insular setting. The dentition of H. floresiensis is not a simple, scaled-down version of earlier hominins. © 2015 Kaifu et al.

A severe problem concerns the loss of dental materials (enamel and dentine) at the buccal cervical region of the tooth. This ""modern-day"" pathology, called non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs), is ubiquitous and worldwide spread, but is very sporadic in modern humans from pre-industrialized societies. Scholars believe that several factors are involved, but the real dynamics behind this pathology are far from being understood. Here we use an engineering approach, finite element analysis (FEA), to suggest that the lack of dental wear, characteristic of industrialized societies, might be a major factor leading to NCCLs. Occlusal loads were applied to high resolution finite element models of lower second premolars (P2) to demonstrate that slightly worn P2s envisage high tensile stresses in the buccal cervical region, but when worn down artificially in the laboratory the pattern of stress distribution changes and the tensile stresses decrease, matching the results obtained in naturally worn P2s. In the modern industrialized world, individuals at advanced ages show very moderate dental wear when compared to past societies, and teeth are exposed to high tensile stresses at the buccal cervical region for decades longer. This is the most likely mechanism explaining enamel loss in the cervical region, and may favor the activity of other disruptive processes such as biocorrosion. Because of the lack of dental abrasion, our masticatory apparatus faces new challenges that can only be understood in an evolutionary perspective. © 2013 Benazzi et al.",,"adaptation; article; cheek; corrosion; finite element analysis; human; human tissue; malocclusion; mastication; molecular evolution; morphology; premolar tooth; stress; tooth brushing; tooth disease; Adaptation, Physiological; Computer Simulation; Dental Occlusion; Dental Stress Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Biological; Tensile Strength; Tooth Diseases; Tooth Wear",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876584680

While PCG.2 appears to be certainly attributable to Homo erectus, FS-72 is somewhat more problematic, even though it is commonly listed within the Indonesian H. erectus hypodigm. Largely because of its large size, it was originally attributed to Meganthropus paleojavanicus. Subsequent study highlighted a set of metric and nonmetric crown features also found in Australopith and African early Homo (notably H. habilis) homologues. An additional problem with the taxonomic assignment of isolated teeth from the Pleistocene of Java is the presence of Pongo in these same deposits. Methods: To assess the taxonomic affinity of FS-72, we investigated its inner structure (tissue proportions and enamel-dentine junction morphology) by using techniques of 2-3D virtual imaging coupled with geometric morphometric analyses. Results: The results show that FS-72 has thinner enamel compared to fossil and recent humans and that its topographic repartition more closely follows the pongine pattern. It also exhibits a Pongo-like elongated morphology of the enamel-dentine junction, with proportionally lower and mesiodistally spaced dentine horns. Conclusions: Given the morphological and metric similarities between fossil orangutan and H. erectus molars, we tested the hypothesis that its internal morphology more closely resembles the patterns evinced by PCG.2 and modern humans than Pongo. Accordingly, we consider that FS-72 more likely represents a dm2 of Pongo rather than Homo. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","deciduous molar FS-72; Early Pleistocene; hominid paleobiodiversity; internal structure; Sangiran Dome","animal tissue; Article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; deciduous tooth; enamel; fossil hominid; Indonesia; morphometrics; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; structure analysis; taxonomic identification; anatomy and histology; animal; classification; fossil; hominid; human; molar tooth; orangutan; physical anthropology; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Dental Enamel; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Indonesia; Molar; Paleodontology; Pongo",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947044726

Early Cretaceous birds have been recovered from Gansu Province in western China. A single bird bone has also been recovered marine Cretaceous sediments in Japan. Most of the early Cenozoic records are of gruiform birds, while late Cenozoic records constitute a variety of taxa, including some forms closely related to, or congeneric with, Struthio, as well as ducks (Anatidae), game birds (Galliformes), a few birds of prey (Falconiformes) and doves (Columbidae), so the length of the record is long, though not particularly rich. Recently work by Hou has vastly increased thediversity of Pleistocene birds from China, particularly from the Peking Man Site (Zhoukoudian) in North China. Yeh's analysis of four nearly complete avian skeletons from Miocene-aged caldera lake deposits of Shandong Province in central China, has given a better idea of whole animal biology of several groups of birds in the Oriental Realm, especially for the game birds. Hasegawa's, Ono's, and Olson's work on Japanese fossil birds is rapidly adding to knowledge from that area as well. Because of the current increased field activity, refined field techniques, and developing interest in fossil birds in both China and Japan, the quality of the record has increased markedly in the last five years. Fossil birds are extremely rare in the remainder ofSoutheast Asia and most are of Pleistocene age.

The EDJ was visualised by segmenting microtomographic scans of each molar. A geometric morphometric methodology compared the positioning of the dentine horns, the shape of the marginal ridge between the dentine horns, and the shape of the cervix. We also examined the manifestation of non-metric traits at the EDJ including the crista obliqua, cusp 5, and post-paracone tubercle. Furthermore, we report on additional morphological features including centrally placed dentine horn tips and twinned dentine horns. Our results indicate that EDJ morphology can discriminate with a high degree of reliability between Neanderthals and recent modern humans at every molar position, and discriminate between the earlier and the later Neanderthal samples at every molar position, except for the M3 in shape space. The cervix in isolation can also discriminate between Neanderthals and recent modern humans, except at the M3 in form space, and is effective at discriminating between the earlier and the later Neanderthal samples, except at the M2/M2 in form space. In addition to demonstrating the taxonomic valence of the EDJ, our analysis reveals unique manifestations of dental traits in Neanderthals and expanded levels of trait variation that have implications for trait definitions and scoring. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dental morphology; EDJ; MicroCT; Molars; Neanderthal; Non-metric dental traits","dentition; Eemian; enamel; morphology; Neanderthal; Permian; taxonomy; trend analysis; anatomy and histology; animal; comparative study; dentin; enamel; fossil; Homo neanderthalensis; human; image processing; mandible; maxilla; molar tooth; Animals; Dental Enamel; Dentin; Fossils; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mandible; Maxilla; Molar; Neanderthals",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009345401

Although enamel thickness and enamel dentine junction (EDJ) morphology preserve important information about hominin systematics and dietary adaptation, these features have not been sufficiently studied with regard to early Homo. We used micro-CT to compare enamel thickness and EDJ morphology among the mandibular postcanine dentitions of South African early hominins (N = 30) and extant Homo sapiens (N = 26), with special reference to early members of the genus Homo. We found that South African early Homo shows a similar enamel thickness distribution pattern to modern humans, although three-dimensional average and relative enamel thicknesses do not distinguish australopiths, early Homo, and modern humans particularly well. Based on enamel thickness distributions, our study suggests that a dietary shift occurred between australopiths and the origin of the Homo lineage. We also observed that South African early Homo postcanine EDJ combined primitive traits seen in australopith molars with derived features observed in modern human premolars.

This evidence seems supportive of an intense but also more discontinuous pattern of occupation. The severe climatic oscillations, the extent of the desert areas and the possibility of intermittent exchanges between continental and insular East Asia, depending on sea level changes, are key factors to identify possible sink and sources in the region.

We aim to investigate where the Hexian mandible fits within the genus Homo variability in the light of an increased and better characterized Asian fossils record. Methods: Comparative samples include Pleistocene Homo mandibles and teeth from Africa, Asia, and Europe, as well as earlier African hominins (Australopithecus and early Homo) and Holocene recent humans. Both conventional morphological description and metric analysis were used. In addition, virtual reconstructions of the enamel dentine junction (EDJ) surface, pulp cavity, and roots with micro-CT were used to the mandible and teeth. Results: The Hexian mandible is characterized by a plesiomorphic structural pattern for the Homo clade, with strong corpus robustness and a subparallel and low-positioned mylohyoid line that differentiates the swollen subalveolar planum from the shallow subalveolar fossa. Features that are derived compared to early Homo include a moderately curved dental arcade, a well-developed lateral prominence placed at the M2-M3 level, and multiple mental foramina. The Hexian mandible's complex enamel surface and strong, stout root structure are primitive traits for the Homo clade. Finally, the highly crenulated “dendrite-like” EDJ found in the molars may represent a dental feature specific to the continental Asian Homo erectus, but more data is needed to confirm this. Conclusions: Mandibular and dental features indicate that the Hexian mandible and teeth differ from northern Chinese H. erectus and European Middle Pleistocene hominins, but show some affinities with the Early Pleistocene specimens from Africa (Homo ergaster) and Java (H. erectus), as well as the Middle-Late Pleistocene mandible from Penghu, Taiwan. Compared to contemporaneous continental Asian hominin populations, the Hexian fossils may represent the survival of a primitive hominin, with more primitive morphologies than other contemporaneous or some chronologically older Asian hominin specimens. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Homo erectus; mandible; morphological diversity; teeth","Africa; China; cladistics; dendrite; dentin; enamel; Europe; fossil; genus; Holocene; human; human experiment; Lower Pleistocene; mandible; micro-computed tomography; Middle Pleistocene; molar tooth; nonhuman; plesiomorphy; Taiwan; Upper Pleistocene; anatomy and histology; animal; comparative anatomy; hominid; mandible; physical anthropology; tooth; Anatomy, Comparative; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; China; Fossils; Hominidae; Mandible; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009957558

In the present study we provide a detailed metric and morphological comparison of the Yiyuan dental sample in order to characterize better the variability of the human populations that inhabited China during the Middle Pleistocene. Aside from taxonomic and phylogenetic questions, the lack of understanding and/or knowledge about the morphological variability of these populations have caused concern about the human versus non-human nature of some of the hominin dental remains found in East Asia during the Early and the Middle Pleistocene. Thus, our study aims to present a detailed description and comparison of the Yiyuan isolated teeth to 1) discuss and support their human nature and 2) to explore their taxonomic affinities with regard to other penecontemporaneous populations from Asia. Our results clearly differentiate the Yiyuan sample from Pongo specimens and support a human attribution for the Yiyuan material. Our analyses also suggest that the Yiyuan teeth form a morphologically coherent group together with samples from Zhoukoudian, Chaoxian and Hexian. They are different from the more derived specimens from Panxian Dadong, suggesting a pattern of biogeographic isolation and different evolutionary trends between northern and southern China during the Middle Pleistocene. In addition, and despite sharing a common morphological bauplan with Homo erectus sensu stricto (s.s.), the Yiyuan, Zhoukoudian and Hexian teeth are also different from the Indonesian Early Pleistocene samples. In particular, the expression of a highly crenulated or dendritic enamel-dentine surface could be unique to these groups. Our study supports the notion that the taxonomy of the Pleistocene hominins from Asia may have been oversimplified. Future studies should explore the variability of the Asian specimens and reconsider whether all the samples can be attributed to H. erectus s.s. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Dental materials; Homo erectus; Micro-CT; Morphology","biogeography; fossil; hominid; morphology; Pleistocene; skull; taxonomy; tomography; tooth; China; Homo erectus; Pongo; anatomy and histology; animal; China; classification; evolution; fossil; hominid; phylogeny; physical anthropology; tooth; Animals; Biological Evolution; China; Fossils; Hominidae; Paleodontology; Phylogeny; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962775727

Results suggest obvious evolutionary changes in the occlusal morphology and crown outline shape of mandibular premolars. Australopithecus P3s are found with extremely asymmetrical crown outlines, prominent mesial and distal vertical grooves on the buccal side, open foveas, and well-developed talonids, and P4s with similarly asymmetrical crown outlines, distinct mesial and distal vertical grooves on the buccal side, and ""H"" type of grooves combination. These characteristics are also expressed in the later hominin specimens, but with a decreased extent and lower frequency. The P3s of recent Chinese, slightly asymmetrical in the crown lingual contours, and P4s, basically symmetrical in the crown outlines, become faint or disappeared in the mesial or distal vertical buccal grooves, and decreased in the talonid size. It is suggested that Zhoukoudian mandibular premolars preserve some primitive traits of earlier hominins, including asymmetrical crown outlines and prominent mesial and distal vertical grooves of buccal side. Moreover, Zhoukoudian specimens exhibit obvious morphological variation between individuals, expressed mainly by aspects of mesial and distal vertical buccal grooves in various degrees, symmetry or asymmetry extent of crown lingual contour, relative location of polygon to the corresponding surrounding outline, as well as the relative size of talonid. When compared with Homo erectus from the other areas of Asia, Zhoukoudian specimens show their similarity with those of Xichuan and S-1, and at the same time great discrepancy with S-6 in the occlusal morphology and crown outline shape. When it comes to the relationship between specimens of Europe Pleistocene and Zhoukoudian, disparity is expressed in a stronger way than the corresponding similarity. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Fossil hominins; Geometric morphometric; Premolars; Shape; Zhoukoudian","Australopithecus; Homo erectus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-71049163395

It is arguably difficult to perform a direct analysis of the natural selection forces behind such a change in body size. Here, we used quantitative evolutionary genetic models, coupled with simulations and pattern-oriented modelling, to analyse the evolution of brain and body size in Homo floresiensis, a diminutive hominin species that appeared around 700 kya and survived up to relatively recent times (60-90 kya) on Flores Island, Indonesia. The hypothesis of neutral evolution was rejected in 97% of the simulations, and estimated selection gradients are within the range found in living natural populations. We showed that insularity may have triggered slightly different evolutionary trajectories for body and brain size, which means explaining the exceedingly small cranial volume of H. floresiensis requires additional selective forces acting on brain size alone.

However, relatively recent analyses have cast doubt on this assertion. The most compelling reason for this doubt was the absence of siliceous aggregates in the Zhoukoudian deposits. This study presents evidence establishing the controlled use of fire by Homo erectus pekinensis through analyses of four soil samples sourced from Layers 4 and 6 at Zhoukoudian Locality 1. These results demonstrate that all four specimens contain siliceous aggregates as well as elemental carbon, and the potassium content of the insoluble residues of these specimens ranges between 1.21 % and 2.94 %. The analyses provide strong evidence of the in situ use of fire by Homo erectus pekinensis. © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Elemental carbon; Fire use; Homo erectus; Middle pleistocene; Siliceous aggregate; Zhoukoudian","Homo erectus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892886752

In this study, dental crown shape of the three early Pleistocene hominin teeth (P3, M1, and M1) found in Jianshi, Hubei Province of China was analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. The comparative samples of fossil hominins from Africa, Asia, and Europe as well as those of modern humans (N = 257) were used. The results indicate that the contour, asymmetry, and cusp patterns of these three types of teeth differ obviously between the fossil hominins and modern humans. The crown shape of P3 in most fossil hominins including Australopithecus, African early Homo, and Asian Pleistocene hominins are asymmetric with their crown occlusal contours long and curving elliptic-shaped. The occlusal contour of the fossil hominin M1 is symmetric and rectangle-shaped with no marked cusp protrusion. The crown shape of fossil M1 is characterized by asymmetric contour with slightly projected metaconid and hypoconid. On the contrary, in modern Chinese and some European late Pleistocene hominins, the crowns of P3s show symmetric contours with buccal side wider than lingual side; the crown shape of M1 is asymmetric with lingual cusp distalplaced, especially for hypoconid; the M1 has symmetric and round crown contour. Our study reveals that Australopithecus has wide variations in its crown shape, whereas these dental morphospaces of Asian hominins are closely placed. The crown contour, symmetry, and cusp patterns of these three teeth of Jianshi hominin resemble those of Asian early and middle Pleistocene hominins. No marked difference in dental crown shape is shown between the Jianshi hominin and other Chinese Homo erectus, and there is also no evidence in support of the Jianshi hominin's closeness to Australopithecus and African early Homo members. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","China; geometric morphometric; Hubei; human evolution; Jianshi; shape; tooth","Crown shape; Dental crowns; East Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Hominins; Homo erectus; Hubei Province; Human evolution; Late Pleistocene; Morphometric analysis; Pleistocene; Geometry; Dentistry; asymmetry; fossil record; geometry; hominid; human evolution; morphology; morphometry; Pleistocene; shape; symmetry; taxonomy; tooth; China; Hubei; Jianshi; Australopithecus; Homo erectus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955306088

Because cercopithecoids, nearly always found in stratigraphic association with hominin remains in Plio-Pleistocene deposits, are considered as sensitive ecological and chronological biomarkers, a significant effort should be made to clarify their palaeobiodiversity by assessing additional reliable morphological diagnostic criteria. Here we test the relevance of both molar crown internal structure and bony labyrinth morphology for discrimination of fossil cercopithecoid species. We use microtomographic-based 3D virtual imaging and quantitative analyses to investigate tooth endostructural organization and inner ear shape in 29 craniodental specimens from the South African sites of Kromdraai, Makapansgat, Sterkfontein and Swartkrans and provide the first detailed description of the internal structural condition characterizing this Plio-Pleistocene primate assemblage. Our preliminary results show that enamel-dentine junction morphology could be informative for discriminating highly autapomorphic taxa such as Theropithecus, while semicircular canal shape is tentatively proposed as an efficient criterion for diagnosing Dinopithecus ingens. Further research in virtual paleoprimatology may contribute to the identification of unassigned isolated fossil remains and shed new light on the internal craniodental morphology of extinct primate taxa. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bony labyrinth; Deformation-based models; Dental internal structure; Old World monkeys; Primate palaeobiodiversity; Taxonomy","biodiversity; fossil record; morphology; Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary; primate; skeletal remains; taxonomy; tooth; Gauteng; Kromdraai; Limpopo; Makapansgat; South Africa; Sterkfontein; Swartkrans Cave; Cercopithecidae; Cercopithecoidea; Primates; Theropithecus; anatomy and histology; animal; Cercopithecinae; fossil; molar tooth; physical anthropology; semicircular canal; South Africa; Animals; Cercopithecinae; Fossils; Molar; Paleodontology; Semicircular Canals; South Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969143090

Metameric variation likely reflects developmental and taxonomical issues, and could also be used to infer ecological and functional adaptations. However, its patterning along the early hominin postcanine dentition, particularly among South African fossil hominins, remains unexplored. Materials and Methods: Using microfocus X-ray computed tomography (µXCT) and geometric morphometric tools, we studied the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) morphology and we investigated the intra- and inter-individual EDJ metameric variation among eight australopiths and two early Homo specimens from South Africa, as well as 32 modern humans. Results: Along post-canine dentition, shape changes between metameres represented by relative positions and height of dentine horns, outlines of the EDJ occlusal table are reported in modern and fossil taxa. Comparisons of EDJ mean shapes and multivariate analyses reveal substantial variation in the direction and magnitude of metameric shape changes among taxa, but some common trends can be found. In modern humans, both the direction and magnitude of metameric shape change show increased variability in M2-M3 compared to M1-M2. Fossil specimens are clustered together showing similar magnitudes of shape change. Along M2-M3, the lengths of their metameric vectors are not as variable as those of modern humans, but they display considerable variability in the direction of shape change. Conclusion: The distalward increase of metameric variation along the modern human molar row is consistent with the odontogenetic models of molar row structure (inhibitory cascade model). Though much remains to be tested, the variable trends and magnitudes in metamerism in fossil hominins reported here, together with differences in the scale of shape change between modern humans and fossil hominins may provide valuable information regarding functional morphology and developmental processes in fossil species. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Australopithecus africanus; early Homo; Homo sapiens; metamerism; Paranthropus robustus; tooth internal structure","Canis; dentin; development; enamel; fossil hominin; functional morphology; height; horn; human; model; molar tooth; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; South Africa; x-ray computed tomography; anatomy and histology; animal; dentin; enamel; fossil; hominid; micro-computed tomography; physical anthropology; principal component analysis; tooth; Animals; Dental Enamel; Dentin; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Paleodontology; Principal Component Analysis; Tooth; X-Ray Microtomography",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020074711

This paper discusses two aspects of Zhoukoudian in transition: research histories and lithic technologies. From a historical perspective, the study considers the change in research paradigms and perspectives to examine how research at Zhoukoudian has transformed Chinese Palaeolithic archaeology in the last two decades. This paper will give an overview on lithic assemblages at Zhoukoudian to illustrate the complexity of lithic industries in North China, which are not yet fully understood. In conclusion, the study suggests more research problems rather than prestige collections that were inherited by the current generation of scholars, who call for careful reviews of valuable historic data, including lithic, faunal, sediment, and human remains, before any further interpretations are produced. This study suggests that lithic industries in transition at Zhoukoudian can provide another line of evidence to support the continuous development of Pleistocene hominid evolutions, especially leading to the origins of modern humans in China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","China; Human evolution; Lithic technologies; Pleistocene archaeology; Zhoukoudian","archaeology; fossil record; hominid; human evolution; lithic fragment; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; China; Hominidae; Homo erectus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948798730

Most studies on primate enamel thickness have primarily considered the permanent teeth, while the extent of covariation in tooth enamel thickness distribution between deciduous and permanent counterparts remains poorly investigated. In this test study on nine extant and fossil hominids we investigated the degree of covariation in enamel proportions between 25 pairs of mandibular dm2 and M1 by a so-called “lateral enamel thickness diphyodontic index”. The results did not provide an unambiguous picture, but rather suggest complex patterns likely resulting from the influence of many interactive factors. Future research should test the congruence of the “diphyodontic signal” between the anterior and the postcanine dentition, as well as between enamel and the enamel-dentine junction topography. © 2017 Académie des sciences","Dm2; Enamel; Hominids; M1; “Diphyodontic index”","dentition; enamel; evolutionary theory; fossil record; hominid; index method; tooth; Hominidae; Primates",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020652454

At Zhoukoudian locality 1 (ZKD1) in north China, numerous bipolar reduction artifacts were reported, and this has become a major technological label of the lithic industry. However, few experimental analyses have been conducted on this site. This study conducted experimental analysis to build an experimental referential framework for distinguishing bipolar products, and then chose a small lithic artifact sample from layers 4-5 to evaluate the role of bipolar reduction. These data show freehand reduction produces a higher percentage of usable flakes and also more cutting edges per flake than that by bipolar reduction in general. More freehand reduction flakes were chosen as tool blanks than bipolar flakes. The contribution of the bipolar flaking method to the lithic industry of Zhoukoudian locality 1 has been overestimated. This paper proposes that bipolar reduction is likely to have been an expedient strategy as a supplement of freehand reduction at Zhoukoudian locality 1. Consequently, it should be seen as an adaptive characteristic of the industry instead of an evolutionary one, and also cannot be used to trace technological diffusion or cultural tradition. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Bipolar reduction; Experimental study; Freehand reduction; Quartz; Zhoukoudian locality 1","archaeology; artifact; experimental study; quartz; reduction; technological development; Beijing [China]; China; Zhoukoudian",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945576506

Cutting between island landmasses, Wallace's Line separates Sunda and the Eastern Island Arc (the Arc) into distinct tectonic and faunal provinces. West of the line, on Sunda, Java Island yields many fossils of Homo erectus. East of the line, on the Arc, Flores Island provides one skeleton and isolated remains of Homo floresiensis. Luzon Island in the Philippines has another fossil hominin. Sulawesi preserves early hominin archeology. This insular divergence sets up a unique regional context for early hominin dispersal, isolation, and extinction. The evidence is reviewed across three Pleistocene climate periods. Patterns are discussed in relation to the pulse of global sea-level shifts, as well as regional geo-tectonics, catastrophes, stegodon dispersal, and paleogenomics. Several patterns imply evolutionary processes typical of oceanic islands. Early hominins apparently responded to changing island conditions for a million-and-a-half years, likely becoming extinct during the period in which Homo sapiens colonized the region. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Flores; Homo erectus; Homo floresiensis; Insular dwarfism; Island rule; Java; Luzon; Marine Isotope Stages (MIS); Sulawesi; Sunda; Timor","animal; evolution; hominid; Indonesia; island (geological); physical anthropology; physiology; population migration; technology; tool use; Animal Migration; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Biological Evolution; Hominidae; Indonesia; Islands; Technology; Tool Use Behavior",Retracted,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944746308
