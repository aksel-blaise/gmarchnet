Here, phenotypic covariance and correlation structure is compared among Platyrrhine Neotropical primates. Comparisons range from among species within a genus to the superfamily level. Matrix correlation followed by Mantel's test and vector correlation among responses to random natural selection vectors (random skewers) were used to compare correlation and variance/covariance matrices of 39 skull traits. Sampling errors involved in matrix estimates were taken into account in comparisons using matrix repeatability to set upper limits for each pairwise comparison. Results indicate that covariance structure is not strictly constant but that the amount of variance pattern divergence observed among taxa is generally low and not associated with taxonomic distance. Specific instances of divergence are identified. There is no correlation between the amount of divergence in covariance patterns among the 16 genera and their phylogenetic distance derived from a conjoint analysis of four already published nuclear gene datasets. In contrast, there is a significant correlation between phylogenetic distance and morphological distance (Mahalanobis distance among genus centroids). This result indicates that while the phenotypic means were evolving during the last 30 millions years of New World monkey evolution, phenotypic covariance structures of Neotropical primate skulls have remained relatively consistent. Neotropical primates can be divided into four major groups based on their feeding habits (fruit-leaves, seed-fruits, insect-fruits, and gum-insect-fruits). Differences in phenotypic covariance structure are correlated with differences in feeding habits, indicating that to some extent changes in interrelationships among skull traits are associated with changes in feeding habits. Finally, common patterns and levels of morphological integration are found among Platyrrhine primates, suggesting that functional/developmental integration could be one major factor keeping covariance structure relatively stable during evolutionary diversification of South American monkeys.","Cranial morphology; Developmental modularity; Morphological integration; Phenotypic covariance structure; Phylogeny; Platyrrhini; Quantitative genetics","cranium; evolution; genetic variation; morphology; phenology; primate; Insecta; Mammalia; Platyrrhini; Primates; Vertebrata; animal; article; biological model; Cebidae; classification; evolution; genetic variability; genetics; histology; phenotype; phylogeny; reproducibility; skull; Animals; Cebidae; Evolution; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035544555

Our sample consists of 38 crania: 20 modern adult Homo sapiens, 14 subadult H. sapiens, and four archaic Homo. All specimens were CT-scanned except for two infant H, sapiens, who were imaged by MR instead. For each specimen 84 landmarks and semilandmarks were located on the midsagittal plane and converted to Procrustes shape coordinates. Integration was quantified by the method of singular warps, a new geometric-statistical approach to visualizing correlations among regions. The two classic patterns of integration, evolutionary and ontogenetic, were jointly explored by comparing analyses of overlapping subsamples that span ranges of different hypothetical factors. Evolutionary integration is expressed in the subsample of 24 adult Homo, and ontogenetic integration in the subsample of 34 H. sapiens. In this data set, vault, cranial base, and face show striking and localized patterns of covariation over ontogeny, similar but not identical to the patterns seen over evolution. The principal differences between ontogeny and phylogeny pertain to the cranial base. There is also a component of cranial to height ratio not reducible to either process. Our methodology allows a separation of these independent processes (and their impact on cranial shape) that conventional methods have not found. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We summarize key aspects of cranial base growth and development in primates that are useful for formulating and testing hypotheses about the roles of the chondrocranium and basicranium in cranial growth, integration, and function in primate and human evolution. We review interspecific, experimental, and ontogenetic evidence for interactions between the cranial base and brain, and between the cranial base and the face. These interactions indicate that the cranial base plays a key role in craniofacial growth, helping to integrate, spatially and functionally, different patterns of growth in various adjoining regions of the skull such as components of the brain, the eyes, the nasal cavity, the oral cavity, and the pharynx. Brain size relative to cranial base length appears to be the dominant influence on many aspects of basicranial variation, especially the angle of the cranial base in the midsagittal plane, but other factors such as facial size, facial orientation, and posture may also be important. Major changes in cranial base shape appear to have played crucial roles in the evolution of early primates, the origin of anthropoids, and the origin of Homo sapiens. © 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Basicranium; Chondrocranium; Cranial base; Humans; Primates",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000164329

A model is presented for developmental interactions that occur during ontogeny between the brain and the cranial base and neurocranium, and between the neurobasicranial complex (NBC) and the face. The model is tested using exocranial and radiographic measurements of adult crania sampled from five geographically and craniometrically diverse populations. The results indicate that while variations in the breadth, length and flexion of the cranial base are mutually independent, only the maximum breadth of the cranial base (POB) has significant effects on overall cranial proportions, largely through its interactions with brain volume which influence NBC breadth. These interactions also have a slight influence on facial shape because NBC width constrains facial width, and because narrow-faced individuals tend to have antero-posteriorly longer faces relative to facial breadth than wide-faced individuals. Finally, the model highlights how integration between the cranial base and the brain may help to account for the developmental basis of some morphological variations such as occipital bunning. Among modern humans, the degree of posterior projection of the occipital bone appears to be a consequence of having a large brain on a relatively narrow cranial base. Occipital buns in Neanderthals, who have wide cranial bases relative to endocranial volume, may not be entirely homologous with the morphology occasionally evident in Homo sapiens.","Basicranium; Cranium; Integration; Neurocranium; Occipital bun; Skull","morphometry; skull; Crania; Hominidae; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034070524

T6G 2G1, Canada","Nontraditional or geometric morphometric methods have found wide application in the biological sciences, especially in anthropology, a field with a strong history of measurement of biological form. Controversy has arisen over which method is the ""best"" for quantifying the morphological difference between forms and for making proper statistical statements about the detected differences. This paper explains that many of these arguments are superfluous to the real issues that need to be understood by those wishing to apply morphometric methods to biological data. Validity, the ability of a method to find the correct answer, is rarely discussed and often ignored. We explain why demonstration of validity is a necessary step in the evaluation of methods used in morphometrics. Focusing specifically on landmark data, we discuss the concepts of size and shape, and reiterate that since no unique definition of size exists, shape can only be recognized with reference to a chosen surrogate for size. We explain why only a limited class of information related to the morphology of an object can be known when landmark data are used. This observation has genuine consequences, as certain morphometric methods are based on models that require specific assumptions, some of which exceed what can be known from landmark data. We show that orientation of an object with reference to other objects in a sample can never be known, because this information is not included in landmark data. Consequently, a descriptor of form difference that contains information on orientation is flawed because that information does not arise from evidence within the data, but instead is a product of a chosen orientation scheme. To illustrate these points, we apply superimposition, deformation, and linear distance-based morphometric methods to the analysis of a simulated data set for which the true differences are known. This analysis demonstrates the relative efficacy of various methods to reveal the true difference between forms. Our discussion is intended to be fair, but it will be obvious to the reader that we favor a particular approach. Our bias comes from the realization that morphometric methods should operate with a definition of form and form difference consistent with the limited class of information that can be known from landmark data. Answers based on information that can be known from the data are of more use to biological inquiry than those based on unjustifiable assumptions.

Previous analysis of craniometric variation (Relethford [1994] Am J Phys Anthropol 95:53-62) found that between 11-14% of global diversity exists among geographic regions, with the remaining diversity existing within regions. The methods used in this earlier paper are extended to a hierarchical partitioning of genetic diversity in quantitative traits, allowing for assessment of diversity among regions, among local populations within regions, and within local populations. These methods are applied to global data on craniometric variation (57 traits) and skin color. Multivariate analysis of craniometric variation shows results similar to those obtained from genetic markers and DNA polymorphisms: roughly 13% of the total diversity is among regions, 6% among local populations within regions, and 81% within local populations. This distribution is concordant with neutral genetic markers. Skin color shows the opposite pattern, with 88% of total variation among regions, 3% among local populations within regions, and 9% within local populations, a pattern shaped by natural selection.

The parental lines show a large difference in PC1 (30.4 environmental standard deviations), and the markers account for >80% of the phenotypic variation in backcross populations. Eight of 15 intervals analyzed show convincing evidence of quantitative trial loci (QTL), and the range of estimated QTL effects is 5.7-15.9% of the parental difference (1.7-4.8 environmental standard deviations). These estimates may represent the joint effects of multiple QTL within a single interval (which averaged 23 cM in length).

The most often used methods of analysis of admixture in Latin America and some problems related to them, such as the determination of the parental populations and selection of genetic markers, are briefly reviewed. Several sources of data for admixture studies (surnames, quantitative traits, proteins, and molecular information) are summarized. The results obtained using protein systems and blood groups, the most often used markers in Latin America, are considered. They are classified according to their application in 3 groups of populations: urban centers, native Americans, and African-descended subjects. The data show that almost every population is dihybrid or trihybrid, and when African influence is not detected, it is probably due more to the method than to an absence of that contribution. A special section is dedicated to the direction of gene flow, and results about directional mating based on mtDNA, Y-chromosome, and nuclear DNA or proteins are also given. From these studies it is possible to conclude that Amerindian admixture came mainly from female lineages, but it is difficult to establish what happened with the African contribution. A last subject considered is the relation between interethnic crosses and diseases; it is easy to analyze that relation when the pathological condition is related to a unique allele, but when complex diseases are considered, the results are not as clear because of the influence of nongenetic factors. Finally, the perspectives for admixture studies in the 21st century are considered, and some attempts to predict their future in Latin America are made.","Admixture studies; Hybrid populations; Latin America","Africa; American Indian; article; Caucasian; chromosome map; ethnology; Europe; female; genetic variability; genetics; history; human; male; methodology; migration; Negro; political system; social problem; South and Central America; Africa; African Continental Ancestry Group; Chromosome Mapping; Colonialism; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, Central American; Indians, South American; Latin America; Male; Social Problems; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034143970

While there is considerable comparative evidence to support this idea, most experimental tests of this hypothesis have been on non-human primates or other very prognathic mammals (rodents, swine) raised on hard versus very soft (nearly liquid) diets. Here, we examine facial growth and in vivo strains generated in response to raw/dried foods versus cooked foods in a retrognathic mammal, the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis). The results indicate that the hyrax cranium resembles the non-human primate cranium in having a steep gradient of strains from the occlusal to orbital regions, but differs from most non-anthropoids in being primarily twisted; the hyrax mandible is bent both vertically and laterally. In general, higher strains, as much as two-fold at some sites, are generated by masticating raw versus cooked food. Hyraxes raised on cooked food had significantly less growth (approximately 10%) in the ventral (inferior) and posterior portions of the face, where strains are highest, resembling many of the differences evident between humans raised on highly processed versus less processed diets. The results support the hypothesis that food processing techniques have led to decreased facial growth in the mandibular and maxillary arches in recent human populations. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of this study have been cited for the past 90 years as evidence of cranial plasticity. These findings, however, have never been critiqued thoroughly for their statistical and biological validity. This study presents a reassessment of Boas' data within a modern statistical and quantitative genetic framework. The data used here consist of head and face measurements on over 8,000 individuals of various European ethnic groups. By using pedigree information contained in Boas' data, narrow sense heritabilities are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood. In addition, a series of t tests and regression analyses are performed to determine the statistical validity of Boas' original findings on differentiation between American and European-born children and the prolonged effect of the environment on cranial form. Results indicate the relatively high genetic component of the head and face diameters despite the environmental differences during development. Results point to very small and insignificant differences between European- and American-born offspring, and no effect of exposure to the American environment on the cranial index in children.

In view of the uncertainties introduced by assumptions under which admixture estimates are obtained, it is concluded that the reliability of estimates derived from different methods cannot be formally compared. With examples from several admixed populations, it is shown that all methods do not necessarily give discordant results when identical data are used to obtain admixture estimates. Even though past experiences using admixed populations to detect selection or to understand disease etiology have not been very successful, it is believed that admixed human populations can be regarded as a natural experiment. Hence, they are suitable for microevolutionary and epidemiological studies. The proper identification of ancestral populations and the degree of asymmetry in gene flow (sex‐biased admixture) are important issues in admixture studies. These aspects can be examined in the statistical properties of allele frequency distributions, but corroboration of particular models should be made from in‐depth investigations of historical demography and social structure of admixed populations. Future studies of admixture with DNA polymorphism data may resolve some of the uncertainties associated with current techniques of detecting genetic polymorphisms. Because of the abundance of genetic data, it is argued that morphological traits are of limited use in resolving current problems of human admixture studies.

The relative influence of these three factors has been argued in the literature, most recently in a series of articles debating the statistical and biological significance of Boas's immigration studies as they relate to cranial plasticity. The Boas debate is discussed within the broader context of debate over genetic and environmental influences on craniometric variation. Additional examples are provided from an ongoing study of global craniometric variation. Although developmental plasticity and climatic adaptation have had an impact on craniometric variation, these factors tend not to erase, or even obscure greatly, underlying patterns of population structure and history that fit a neutral model of quantitative variation.

We suggest how developmental and functional criteria can be used to predict where in the skeleton of fossil hominins we should expect more, or less, within-species variation. We present and test three hypotheses about the factors contributing to craniodental variation in extant primate taxa, and then apply these results to the interpretation of the P. boisei hypodigm. Within the comparative samples of extant Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Colobus, variables from the cranial base, neurocranium, and face that are not subject to high magnitudes of strain have consistently lower levels of intraspecific variation than variables from regions of the face subject to high levels of strain. Dental size variables are intermediate in terms of their reliability. P. boisei is found to have a low degree of variability relative to extant primates for variables shown to be generally useful for testing taxonomic hypotheses. Contrary to the claims of Suwa et al. ([1997] Nature 389:489-492), the recently discovered material from Konso falls within the range of variation of the ""pre-Konso"" hypodigm of P. boisei for available conventional metrical variables. Those aspects of the Konso material that appear to extend the range of the P. boisei hypodigm involve regions of the skull predicted to be prone to high levels of within-species variation.

Constancy of phenotypic covariances is unlikely without constancy of genetic covariation if the latter is a substantial component of the former. If phenotypic patterns are found to be relatively stable, the most probable explanation is that genetic covariance matrices are also stable. Factors like morphological integration account for such stability. Morphological integration can be studied by analyzing the relationships among morphological traits. We present here a comparison of phenotypic correlation and covariance structure among worldwide human populations. Correlation and covariance matrices between 47 cranial traits were obtained for 28 populations, and compared with design matrices representing functional and developmental constraints. Among-population differences in patterns of correlation and covariation were tested for association with matrices of genetic distances (obtained after an examination of 10 Alu-insertions) and with Mahalanobis distances (computed after craniometrical traits). All matrix correlations were estimated by means of Mantel tests. Results indicate that correlation and covariance structure in our species is stable, and that among-group correlation/covariance similarity is not related to genetic or phenotypic distance.

One reason is that bones have numerous functions and grow through a variety of processes, some of which are under strong genetic control, but many of which are highly influenced by external stimuli. Analyses of the angular kinetics, cross-sectional geometries, and microstructural properties of bones reveal information not only about the forces generated by habitual activities but also about osteogenic responses to such forces. Consequently, comparisons of osseous characters are at best an indirect and frequently misleading source of systematic information. By integrating functional and phylogenetic studies of the skeleton with analyses of how bones develop, we may find a useful solution to these problems.","Bone; Evolution; Functional morphology; Hominid; Phylogeny",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000152181

The estimators are based on Euclidean distance matrix analysis. The confidence intervals are calculated using the model independent bootstrap method.

Allele frequency distributions are relatively homogenous in the three samples; only the Federal District population shows minor differences of the HLA-DQA1 allele frequencies compared with the other two. In terms of genetic composition, these Mestizo populations show evidence of admixture with predominantly Spanish-European (50-60%) and Amerindian (37-49%) contributions; the African contribution (1-3%) is minor. Together with the observation that in Nuevo León, the admixture estimates based on D1S80 and HLA-DQA1, are virtually the same as those reported earlier from blood group loci, suggests that DNA markers, such as D1S80 and HLA-DQA1 are useful for examining genetic homogeneity/heterogeneity across Mestizo populations of Mexico. The inverse relationship of the proportion of gene diversity due to population differences (Gst) to within population gene diversity (Hs) is also consistent with theoretical predictions, supporting the use of these markers for population genetics studies.

Florida's total population is approximately 16 million (15,982,378) individuals. Of the total population 2,682,715, or 16.8%, are self-identified as ""Hispanic"". South Florida (herein defined as Miami-Dade, Broward and Collier Counties) is home to 60% of the total Hispanic population of Florida with 1,291,737 (48.15%) residing in Miami-Dade County. The Hispanic population of Miami-Dade County makes up 57.0% of the total population of 2,253,362. Each recognized sub-group of Hispanics (Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban) includes its own geographic point-of-origin and population history. Cuban-Americans (arriving in the late 1950's and early 1960's) make up the largest sub-population of Florida's Hispanics in any county and in Miami-Dade number 650,601 or 51% of the total Latin population. Additionally, as in other agricultural states, Florida has a very large population of undocumented workers who primarily arrive from Texas and points south of the Straits of Florida. Thus the application of the available traditional craniometric and non-metric methods are not appropriate for South Florida's Latin population. To begin to address this issue in relation to South Florida's Cuban population, we present an analysis of cranio-facial shape variation in a 19th Century Cuban sample, 17th Century Spanish sample, a Precontact Cuban sample, and Terry Blacks using geometric morphometric methods. Significant biological shape differences and patterns of variation are observed among the groups. These results provide us with a context in which to begin to understand the biological variation of Cuban Americans, which will enable the development of identification criteria specific for this U.S. hybrid Hispanic community.","3-D coordinate data; Forensic science; Geometric morphometrics; Hispanic populations; Identification methods","biodiversity; conference paper; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; Cuba; Cuban American; data analysis; female; forensic identification; geographic origin; geometric morphometrics; geometry; Hispanic; history; human; male; morphometrics; normal human; population; priority journal; skull; three dimensional coordinate data; United States; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Cuba; Female; Florida; Forensic Anthropology; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Multivariate Analysis",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347021124

To investigate the influence of decreased mechanical loading on the density and mechanical properties of the cancellous bone of the human mandibular condyle. Design. Destructive compressive mechanical tests were performed on cancellous bone specimens. Background. Reduced masticatory function in edentate people leads to a reduction of forces acting on the mandible. As bone reacts to its mechanical environment a change in its material properties can be expected. Methods. Cylindrical bone specimens were obtained from dentate and edentate embalmed cadavers. Mechanical parameters were determined in the axial and in the transverse directions. Subsequently, density parameters were determined according to a method based on Archimedes' principle. Results. The apparent density and volume fraction of the bone were about 18% lower in the edentate group; no age-related effect on density was found. The decrease of bone in the edentate group was associated with a lower stiffness and strength (about 22% and 28%, respectively). The ultimate strain, however, did not differ between the two groups. Both groups had similar mechanical anisotropy; in axial loading the bone was stiffer and stronger than in transverse loading. Conclusions. Reduced mechanical load had affected the density and herewith the mechanical properties of condylar cancellous bone, but not its anisotropy. Relevance. The change in material properties of the cancellous bone after loss of teeth indicate that the mandibular condyle is sensitive for changes in its mechanical environment. Therefore, changes in mechanical loading of the condyle have to be accounted for in surgical procedures of the mandible. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The five sites form a temporal sequence, ranging from prehistoric (ca. 1600 A.D.) to late historic (1830 A.D.), and belonging archaeologically to the Coalescent Tradition, which in South Dakota encompasses the historic Arikara Indians and their prehistoric ancestors. One canonical variate in each sex arranges the sites in their appropriate temporal sequence, presumably reflecting systematic microevolutionary change. The hypothesis that the morphological change resulted from gene flow from either White or Mandan Indian sources was tested using a two‐group discriminate function. The function is found to effectively discriminate a Mandan sample and prehistoric Arikara, but becomes progressively less effective on the historic Arikara crania. This would suggest that Mandan gene flow into Arikara populations is responsible for the observed temporal variation. A similar analysis using British White crania suggests the possibility of slight White influence, but the effect is minimal compared to Mandan.

One of the assumptions needed for their test to be valid is the equality of the variance-covariance matrices in the two populations under consideration. Using recent results from Lele (1993), we propose an alternative test procedure based on EDMA. This new procedure is valid even if the variance-covariance matrices in two populations are not equal. We study the validity (i.e., the correctness of the probability of type-I error) and the power (i.e., the probability of correct rejection of the null hypothesis when it is false) of the test via simulations. We provide also a biological example, comparing the shapes of the midfacial region in Neandertals and anatomically modern humans, where the variance-covariance structures are quite different. © 1996 Academic Press Limited.","Confidence intervals; Estimation of form; Estimation of shape; Estimation of variance; Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA); Landmark coordinate data; Monte Carlo; Neandertals; Parametric bootstrap","boot strapping; Euclidean distance matrix analysis; landmark coordinate; Neandertal; variance",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030512838

Phenotypic dental measurement data were collected for nine samples from the late prehistoric (AD 1200-1400) and historic (AD 1608-1702) periods and subjected to population genetic and statistical analyses. The primary trends were for an increase in tooth size through time, and for an initial increase in dental variability in the early historic period, followed by a subsequent decline in dental variability in the late historic period. Given the increasing stress levels, evidenced by previous bioarchaeological analyses (Larsen [2001] Bioarchaeology of Spanish Florida, Gainesville: University Press of Florida), an environmental explanation for the increase in tooth size is unlikely. It is proposed that the early historic period witnessed aggregation and gene flow with extraregional populations, possibly African slaves or nonlocal Native American population groups. The late historic period may have experienced significant loss of phenotypic variability due to genetic drift. In both time periods, the evolutionary mechanism increased average tooth size, with independent variance effects. Because microevolutionary trends obscure patterns of gene flow and population ancestry, the data were detrended following Konigsberg ([1990a] Hum. Biol. 62:49-70), and submitted to standard population genetic analyses (Relethford et al. [1997] Hum. Biol. 69:443-465). Analysis of the precontact samples in isolation (Irene Mound, Irene Mortuary, and an aggregate coastal sample) indicated little genetic microdifferentiation (FST = 0.008), limited extralocal gene flow, and a small distinction between interior and coastal samples. The inclusion of the historic data dramatically increased variability levels (F ST = 0.019). The analysis of extralocal gene flow indicates that the late mission period experienced significantly less external gene flow, which is consistent with historic models that suggest the social organization of the Guale during this time period may have been significantly altered. Genetic distances also indicate a primary division between inland and coastal precontact samples and a maintenance of biological populations along the coast. In other words, the coastal, early historic, and late historic period samples are phenotypically homogenous, supporting the notion that the mission populations were drawn from the local population base.

Lateral and vertical teleradiographies were taken. Growth of the neurocranial and splanchnocranial components were measured by volumetric (size estimators) and morphometric (shape estimators) indices. All facial components grew. The neurocranial components showed a heterogeneous behavior: The anteroneural component remained stable, and the increase of the midneural component was compensated by a decrease in the posteroneural component. Malnutrition affected the growths of 1) the craniofacial complex, 2) the splanchnocranium, and 3) the respiratory and midneural components. Growth influenced skull shape through 1) increases of the splanchnocranium and the midneural component relative to the neurocranium; 2) decreases of the masticatory and optic components relative to the splanchnocranium, and 3) decreases of the anteroneural and posteroneural components relative to the neurocranium. Malnutrition influenced skull shape through the relationship between the anteroneural component and the neurocranium. These results confirmed the existence of functional interrelationships among the cranial components. A new approach to craniological studies is suggested.

Cluster analyses have been undertaken using the squared Euclidean distance as a measure of proximity and the average linkage between groups (UPGMA), and neighbor-joining algorithms as a branching method, and a bootstrap analysis was used to assess the robustness of the clustering topology. The study was complemented with a principal coordinate analysis and with the application of the Mantel test to measure the degree of correspondence between the information furnished by the female and the male samples. The analyses show that the main source of morphometric variability in the Iberian Peninsula is the Basque population. The second source of variation is provided by two populations (Muslims and Jews), different from the rest from an archaeological and cultural point of view, and can probably be attributed to influences from sub-Saharan Africa. The massive deportations of the Jews in 1492 and of the Moors between the 15th and 17th centuries may have erased this source of variability from the present population of the Iberian Peninsula. The remaining studied populations, including samples from Castile, Cantabria, Andalusia, Catalonia and Balearic Islands, are grouped together, showing a notable morphological homogeneity, despite their temporal and geographic heterogeneity. These results are in general agreement with those obtained in synthetic maps, by analyzing multiple genetic markers. In such studies, the Basque population is described as the main source of genetic variability, not only in the Iberian Peninsula, but also in Western Europe.","Basque population; Craniometry; Iberian Peninsula; Multivariate analysis","algorithm; article; cluster analysis; controlled study; craniometry; female; genetic distance; history; human; human tissue; male; multivariate analysis; population research; spain; Algorithms; Anthropology, Physical; Cluster Analysis; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genotype; History, 19th Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Male; Mediterranean Region; Multivariate Analysis; Phenotype; Sex Characteristics; Skull; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-13344279416

In order to test the utility of discrete cranial traits for estimating genetic distances among populations, estimates of admixture are obtained for gene frequency data and nonmetric cranial data in São Paulo mulattos (M). The gene frequency data serve as a control that the three populations are related as stated: estimates of admixture are obtained by using São Paulo whites (W) and blacks (B) as parental populations and by estimating the parameter of admixture, m, in the model pM = (1 − m) pW + mpB (Elston, 1971) where the p's are either gene frequencies or nonmetric trait frequencies. A test of goodness of fit of the model provides a means of ascertaining whether or not the data fit this linear model. While the gene frequency data indicate distances among the three populations which are highly compatible with the linear model of admixture, the nonmetric data show significant deviations from the model. This implies that the frequencies of the nonmetric traits in the populations used in this analysis are not a linear function of genetic distance. This discourages the use of nonmetric traits in making quantitative conclusions about genetic relationships. It also suggests the need for investigation of the use of other skeletal characters for estimating genetic distance, as well as approaches for such investigations through the study of hybrid individuals.

Based on ethnohistoric evidence, several predictive models for changes in variability are generated. If variability decreases through time, this likely represents the effect of genetic drift in populations experiencing epidemic disease and population loss. If variability increases through time, this suggests that population aggregation or genetic admixture were primary factors shaping the Apalachee population during the mission period. Dental dimensions were collected from a series of precontact (pre-1500), early mission (AD 1633-1650) (San Pedro y San Pablo de Patale), and late mission (post-1657) (San Luis) samples from the Apalachee region and were subjected to univariate and multivariate variability analyses. The results indicate that the late mission San Luis sample was significantly more variable than the Patale or precontact samples; however, the Patale sample exhibited no significant variability change in comparison to the precontact population. This suggests that the missions initially effected limited change in genetic variability in the mission populations. However, San Luis was affected by either admixture or population aggregation to such a degree that the observed variation had increased beyond earlier levels. Given the limited historic evidence for population aggregation at this mission, and the comparatively large resident Spanish population, the increased variability may be indicative of admixture at this mission, and potentially at this mission only. Based on a limited data set, however, it appears that the mission period cannot be typified by a single evolutionary or historic process. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Dental variability; European contact; La Florida missions; Microevolution","article; ethnic group; evolution; genetic drift; human; phenotype; physical anthropology; population genetics; skeleton; tooth; United States; Analysis of Variance; Anthropology, Physical; Evolution; Florida; Genetic Drift; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, Medieval; Humans; Indians, North American; Missions and Missionaries; Multivariate Analysis; Odontometry; Phenotype; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037375971

A.D. 1600–1830). We have utilized a multivariate statistical method based on a principal components analysis of the pooled within‐groups correlation matrix rather than the more traditional methods of ascertaining morphological relationships, e.g., discriminant functions, Mahalanobis' D2, or Penrose's Size and Shape. Our component structure, based on a regional sample and the mathematically simpler principal components analysis, is very similar to the factor structure obtained by Howells (1973) using a world‐wide sample and factor analysis proper. This supports the notion of the “universality” of cranial structure. An axis of temporal variation was introduced into the component space by means of multiple regression. This analysis indicates that a substantial portion of the intergroup variation is temporal in nature and that systematic temporal changes occur along the facial height, transverse frontal flatness, and frontal profile flatness components. Earlier analyses of the same material by more conventional methods either did not detect the temporal trends at all or failed to isolate the specific nature of the temporal changes. The success of the present analysis attests to the value of examining morphological relationships by means of principal components.

The null hypothesis tested was: 'The major skeletal components of the platyrrhine body grow linearly, regardless of their functional dependence to different demands.' The acceptance of the hypothesis will imply that all Saimiri skeletal growth may be satisfactorily explained by independent variables in a single equation. The rejection will suggest that such skeletal growth patterns have to be explained by variables in several different equations, and perhaps these equations may vary with the effect of sex and undernutrition. Control and undernourished squirrel monkeys were radiographed monthly for 2 years; they were also measured; and their volumetric and morphometric neurocranial, facial, and pelvic indices were calculated. The curves that best described each of the 24-point sequences were obtained. Three main growth patterns were observed: 1) Simple linear (femur length for all groups, and pelvic index for control and undernourished females), for which the simple regression equation explained more than 95% of the variation; 2) Complex linear (pelvic index for control and undernourished males, and neurocranial and facial indices for all of the groups), for which more than 95% of the variation was explained by one of the four four-function type equations; and 3) Noncorrelated with age (neurofacial index for undernourished males, and pelviofemoral index for control females and undernourished males and females), which showed nonsignificant correlations with respect to age. The food intake and the oscillations of the environmental temperature might help to explain the undulating growth trajectory observed in the complex linear components.
