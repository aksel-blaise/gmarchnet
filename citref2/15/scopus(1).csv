Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

Box 28147, San Antonio, TX 78284, United States","A major goal in anthropological genetics is the assessment of the effects of different microevolutionary forces. Harpending and Ward (1982) developed a model that aids in this effort by comparing observed and expected heterozygosity within populations in a local region. The expected heterozygosity within a population is a function of the total heterozygosity of the entire region and the distance of the population from the regional mean centroid of allele frequencies. Greater than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having greater heterozygosity than expected. Less than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having less heterozygosity than expected. We extend the Harpending-Ward model to quantitative traits using an equal and additive effects model of inheritance. Here the additive genetic variance within a population is directly proportional to heterozygosity, and its expectation is directly proportional to the genetic distance from the centroid. Under certain assumptions the expectations for phenotypic variances are similar. Observed and expected genetic or phenotypic variance can then be compared to assess the effects of differential external gene flow. When the additive genetic covariance matrix or heritabilities are not known, the phenotypic covariance matrix can be used to provide a conservative application of the model. In addition, we develop new methods for estimation of the genetic relationship matrix (R) from quantitative traits. We apply these models to two data sets: (1) six principal components derived from twenty dermatoglyphic ridge count measures for nine villages in Nepal and (2) ten anthropometric measurements for seven isolated populations in western Ireland. In both cases both the univariate and multivariate analyses provide results that can be directly interpreted in terms of historically known patterns of gene flow.",,"anthropometry; conference paper; heterozygosity; human; india; ireland; mathematical model; population research; quantitative assay; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Dermatoglyphics; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Human; Models, Genetic; Nepal; Northern Ireland; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Variation (Genetics)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025144359

However, the causes for their collapse have been disputed. In this paper, paleoclimatic data are synthesized to show that an interval of severe climatic anomalies occurred across much of China, which were synchronous with a climatic event identified at least in the Northern Hemisphere. Our syntheses also indicate that this climatic interval was not only one of several climatic events during the Holocene, but marked the middle Holocene climatic transition (the ending of Holocene optimum). Based on geological evidences and analysis of relationships between variations in the intensity of the East Asian monsoon and changes in distributional pattern of monsoon-related rain belts in eastern China, we suggest that this climatic anomaly was superimposed on the middle Holocene transition and significantly altered the hydrological regime. This generated an environmental framework of drought in the north and flooding in the south of China, which was mainly responsible for the collapse of Neolithic Cultures around the Central Plain. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"archaeological evidence; climate change; extinction; Holocene; hydrological regime; Neolithic; paleoclimate; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1042290106

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Problems in tree estimation have been seen as weakening the case for a replacement model and favoring a multiregional evolution model. There has been less discussion of patterns of within‐group variation, although the mtDNA evidence has consistently shown the greatest diversity within African populations. Problems of interpretation abound given the numerous factors that can influence within‐group variation, including the possibility of earlier divergence, differences in population size, patterns of population expansion, and variation in migration rates. We present a model of within‐group phenotypic variation and apply it to a large set of craniometric data representing major Old World geographic regions (57 measurements for 1,159 cases in four regions: Europe, Sub‐Saharan Africa, Australasia, and the Far East). The model predicts a linear relationship between variation within populations (the average within‐group variance) and variation between populations (the genetic distance of populations to pooled phenotypic means). On a global level this relationship should hold if the long‐term effective population sizes of each region are correctly specified. Other potential effects on withingroup variation are accounted for by the model. Comparison of observed and expected variances under the assumption of equal effective sizes for four regions indicates significantly greater within‐group variation in Africa and significantly less within‐group variation in Europe. These results suggest that the long‐term effective population size was greatest in Africa. Closer examination of the model suggests that the long‐term African effective size was roughly three times that of any other geographic region. Using these estimates of relative population size, we present a method for analyzing ancient population structure, which provides estimates of ancient migration. This method allows us to reconstruct migration history between geographic regions after adjustment for the effect of genetic drift on interpopulational distances. Our results show a clear isolation of Africa from other regions. We then present a method that allows direct estimation of the ancient migration matrix, thus providing us with information on the actual extent of interregional migration. These methods also provide estimates of time frames necessary to reach genetic equilibrium. The ultimate goal is extracting as much information from present‐day patterns of human variation relevannt to issues of human origins. Our results are in agreement with mismatch distribution analysis of mtDNA, and they support a “weak Garden o Eden” model. In this model, modern‐day variation can be explained by divergence from an initial source (perhaps Africa) into a number o small isolated populations, followed by later population expansion throughout our species. The major populationn expansions of Homo sapiens during and after the late Pleistocene have had the effect of “freezing” ancient patterns of population structure. While this is not the only possible scenario, we do note the close agreement with ecent analyses of mtDNA mismatch distibutions. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Samples were grouped according to their temporal location and subsistence pattern, and represent a transition from a hunting‐gathering adaptation (Mesolithic) to a transitional hunting‐gathering‐agricultural adaptation (A‐C Group) and finally to a fully agricultural adaptation (Meroitic/X‐Group/Christian). The purposes were: (1) to compare the Mesolithic sample with the later Nubian populations; and (2) to evaluate further the hypothesis that change in Nubian craniofacial morphology was due to changing functional demands associated with the progressive change in subsistence adaptation and associated behavior. The results tend to support recent views that the Nubian Mesolithic population is probably ancestral to later Nubian groups, and that the masticatory‐functional hypothesis can best account for craniofacial change among the Nubians since 12,000 B.P. According to this hypothesis systematic reduction in functional demand placed on the masticatory complex from the Mesolithic led, secondarily, to an alteration of the growth of the maxillomandibular complex such that the face became progressively less robust and more inferoposteriorly located relative to the cranial vault. Both the increase in the height of the vault relative to its length, producing a more “globular” appearance, and the reduction in dental size were tertiary, compensatory responses to altered facial size and position.

Previous apportionments of craniometric diversity are similar to these genetic apportionments, implying that interregionally differing selection pressures have played a limited role in producing contemporary human cranial diversity. Here we show that when cranial variation is independently partitioned using principal components analysis of Mosimann shape variables, some estimates of interregional craniometric differentiation are larger than those for most genetic loci. These estimates are similar to estimates for genetic loci where interregionally differing selection pressures are implicated in producing the observed patterns of variation within and among regions. These results suggest that differences among regions in at least some cranial features, particularly in the nasal region, are in part the product of interregionally differing selection pressures. Moreover, these results have implications for assessing the biological affinities of prehistoric samples that are temporally separated from contemporary human reference populations. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","FST; Human diversification; Principal components; Race; Regional continuity; Shape","article; craniometry; gene locus; genetic drift; genetic model; genetic variability; human; human tissue; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; quantitative genetics; race difference; sampling; Cephalometry; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Skull; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-5444225001

Proponents of multiple migration models have claimed that patterns of variation among extant New World populations reflect ancient, discrete migrations to the Americas during the terminal Pleistocene. Although multiple migration models appear to explain patterns of both past and present craniometric variation, this interpretation rests on a number of key assumptions that require further investigation. We examined a series of Paleoindian (n = 11) and Archaic (n = 384) crania from North and South America, and compare these early samples to a large worldwide sample of late Holocene (n = 6,742) remains to assess within-and among-group variability in early samples, and to determine how patterns of variation could be viewed as a reflection of both population history and population structure. Analyses included univariate and multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis, calculation of biological distances, and multivariate allocation methods. We also performed model-bound analyses of these data, including Relethford-Blangero analysis and calculation of FST. Our results indicate that under the assumptions of migration/founder models, the data are consistent with Paleoindians having derived from an undifferentiated Asian population that was not ancestral to modern American Indians. This view can be accommodated into existing models of multiple founders (migrations) in the New World. However, the assumptions required for such an interpretation are not realistic, and the diversity of early populations could as easily reflect population structuring processes such as genetic drift, demographic growth, and other phenomena. When the data were analyzed controlling for the effects of genetic drift (i.e., with smaller long-term effective population sizes for Paleoindians), the Paleoindian samples were no longer distinct from modern Native American populations. Other factors that need to be considered include processes involved in craniofacial change and adaptation during the past 10,000 years. Finally, patterns of variation in the North and South American Paleoindian samples are different, suggesting that the process of New World colonization is more complex than previously assumed.

As in any empirical analysis, the assessment of inter- and intra-observer error is desirable. A review of methods currently being employed to assess measurement error in geometric morphometrics was conducted and three general approaches to the problem were identified. One such approach employs Generalized Procrustes Analysis to superimpose repeatedly digitized landmark configurations, thereby establishing whether repeat measures fall within an acceptable range of variation. The potential problem of this error assessment method (the ""Pinocchio effect"") is demonstrated and its effect on error studies discussed. An alternative approach involves employing Euclidean distances between the configuration centroid and repeat measures of a landmark to assess the relative repeatability of individual landmarks. This method is also potentially problematic as the inherent geometric properties of the specimen can result in misleading estimates of measurement error. A third approach involved the repeated digitization of landmarks with the specimen held in a constant orientation to assess individual landmark precision. This latter approach is an ideal method for assessing individual landmark precision, but is restrictive in that it does not allow for the incorporation of instrumentally defined or Type III landmarks. Hence, a revised method for assessing landmark error is proposed and described with the aid of worked empirical examples. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Measurement error; Morphometrics; Pinocchio effect; Precision","accuracy; analytical error; article; empiricism; geometry; morphometrics; quantitative analysis; theory; Anthropometry; Bone and Bones; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547911458

However, molecular studies have consistently found the mangabeys to be diphyletic, with Cercocebus and Mandrillus forming a clade to the exclusion of all other papionins. Recent studies have identified cranial and postcranial features which distinguish the Cercocebus-Mandrillus clade, however the detailed similarities in cranial shape between the mangabey genera are more difficult to reconcile with the molecular evidence. Given the large size differential between members of the papionin molecular clades, it has frequently been suggested that allometric effects account for homoplasy in papionin cranial form. A combination of geometric morphometric, bivariate, and multivariate methods was used to evaluate the hypothesis that allometric scaling contributes to craniofacial similarities between like-sized papionin taxa. Patterns of allometric and size-independent cranial shape variation were subsequently described and related to known papionin phylogenetic relationships and patterns of development. Results confirm that allometric scaling of craniofacial shape characterized by positive facial allometry and negative neurocranial allometry is present across adult papionins. Pairwise comparisons of regression lines among genera revealed considerable homogeneity of scaling within the Papionini, however statistically significant differences in regression lines also were noted. In particular, Cercocebus and Lophocebus exhibit a shared slope and significant vertical displacement of their allometric lines relative to other papionins. These findings give no support to narrowly construed hypotheses of uniquely shared patterns of allometric scaling, either between sister taxa or across all papionins. However, more general allometric trends do appear to account for a substantial proportion of papionin cranial shape variation, most notably in those features which have influenced traditional morphological phylogenies. Examination of size-uncorrelated shape variation gives no clear support to molecular phylogenies, but underscores the absence of morphometric similarities between the mangabey genera when size effects are controlled. Patterns of allometric and size-uncorrelated shape variation indicate conservatism of cranial form in non-Theropithecus papionins, and suggest that Papio represents the primitive morphometric pattern for the African papionins. Lophocebus exhibits a divergent morphometric pattern, clearly distinguishable from other papionins, most notably Cercocebus. These results clarify patterns of cranial shape variation among the extant Papionini and lay the groundwork for studies of related fossil taxa. © 2002 Elsevier Sciences Ltd.","Allometry; Cranial homoplasy; Geometric morphometrics; Mangabey diphyly; Papionini","cranium; evolution; primate; shape; Cercocebus; Cercopithecidae; Cercopithecinae; Cercopithecus; Lophocebus; Mandrillus; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Papionini; Primates; Primates; Theropithecus; animal; article; cephalometry; evolution; genetic variability; histology; Macaca; papio; phylogeny; regression analysis; skull; Theropithecus; Animals; Cephalometry; Evolution; Macaca; Papio; Phylogeny; Regression Analysis; Skull; Theropithecus; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035998891

In turn, this has led to suggestions that the temporal bone is particularly reliable in analyses of primate phylogeny and human population history. While several reasons have been suggested to explain the temporal bone's strong fit with neutral expectation, the temporal bone has never systematically been compared against other individual cranial bones defined using the same biological criteria. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the shapes of all cranial bones possess reliable information regarding neutral genetic evolution, or whether the temporal bone is unique in this respect. This study tests the hypothesis that the human temporal bone is more congruent with neutral expectation than six other individual cranial bones by correlating population affinity matrices generated using neutral genetic and 3D craniometric data. The results demonstrate that while the temporal bone shows the absolute strongest correlation with neutral genetic data compared with all other bones, it is not statistically differentiated from the sphenoid, frontal, and parietal bones in this regard. Potential reasons for the temporal bone's consistently strong fit with neutral expectation, such as its overall anatomical complexity and/or its contribution to the architecture of the basicranium, are examined. The results suggest that future phylogenetic and taxonomic studies would benefit from considering the shape of the entire cranium minus those regions that deviate most from neutrality. ©2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Neutral evolution; Population history; Temporal bone","article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; frontal bone; human; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phylogeny; physical anthropology; population genetics; primate; skull; sphenoid; temporal bone; Bone Development; Classification; Fossils; Gene Frequency; Genetic Markers; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Skull; Temporal Bone; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349102576

The relative influence of these three factors has been argued in the literature, most recently in a series of articles debating the statistical and biological significance of Boas's immigration studies as they relate to cranial plasticity. The Boas debate is discussed within the broader context of debate over genetic and environmental influences on craniometric variation. Additional examples are provided from an ongoing study of global craniometric variation. Although developmental plasticity and climatic adaptation have had an impact on craniometric variation, these factors tend not to erase, or even obscure greatly, underlying patterns of population structure and history that fit a neutral model of quantitative variation. Thus, craniometric data can be used to explore questions of gene flow and genetic affinity. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,"anatomical variation; anthropometry; article; climate change; craniometry; environmental change; evolutionary adaptation; gene flow; genetic association; genetic distance; human; immigration; morphological adaptation; natural selection; population differentiation; population genetics; population migration; population model; population movement pattern; population structure; priority journal; quantitative analysis; statistical analysis; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Child; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; Female; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Male; Models, Genetic; Selection (Genetics); Temperature; United States; World Health; Boa (genus)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3442883983

However, this has yet to be analyzed at a global level. Here, the relationship between global mandibular shape variation and subsistence economy is tested, while controlling for the potentially confounding effects of shared population history, geography, and climate. The results demonstrate that the mandible, in contrast to the cranium, significantly reflects subsistence strategy rather than neutral genetic patterns, with hunter-gatherers having consistently longer and narrower mandibles than agriculturalists. These results support notions that a decrease in masticatory stress among agriculturalists causes the mandible to grow and develop differently. This developmental argument also explains why there is often a mismatch between the size of the lower face and the dentition, which, in turn, leads to increased prevalence of dental crowding and malocclusions in modern postindustrial populations. Therefore, these results have important implications for our understanding of human masticatory adaptation.","Diet; Mastication; Phenotypic plasticity; Skull","agriculture; animal hunting; article; climate; cold; dentition; economic aspect; face; fishing; genetics; geography; history; human; malocclusion; mandible; mastication; masticatory muscle; maxilla; palate; priority journal; skull; thermoregulation; Adaptation, Physiological; Agriculture; Animal Husbandry; Biological Evolution; Diet; Female; Humans; Life Style; Male; Mandible; Models, Anatomic; Sex Factors; Skull; Stomatognathic System; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-83755183406

In northern China, an abrupt climatic shift at ~4000 cal. yr BP was recorded in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, in the western part of the Chinese Loess Plateau and in the vast Inner Mongolian Plateau. In southern China, the ~4000 cal. yr BP event was also abrupt, but it is expressed as one of several quasi-cyclic events in most of the records. We propose that the cumulative effects of insolation-dictated declining trend in tropical SST and the geologically documented increasing trend of ENSO activity were the first-order causes of the cooling and the associated drying during the past 6000 years. Superimposed on the first-order causes were the second-order causes, i.e. the additive effects of the 'Bond Event 3'-associated lower insolation and the increasingly drying-resulted negative feedback of 'air-land interactions'. The second-order causes made ~4000 cal. yr BP the tipping point when the resultant drying had destroyed many Chinese Neolithic cultures. Our review of published archaeological literature shows that six of the seven well-documented Chinese Neolithic cultures collapsed at ~4000 cal. yr BP with the exception of the Henan Longshan Culture that evolved to the more advanced Erlitou Culture. The indicators of the cultural collapse include (1) the number of archaeological sites was significantly reduced, (2) the quality of the archaeological artifacts of the succeeding culture is lower than that of the preceding culture, (3) more sophisticated architectures disappeared, and (4) agricultural cultures were replaced by pastoralism or by agro-pastoralism in northern China. © The Author(s) 2012.","4.2 ka event; 4000 yr BP event; Chinese cultural domains; environmental archaeology; mid-Holocene transition; paleoclimatology","archaeology; climate variation; cultural influence; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Neolithic; paleoclimate; pastoralism; plateau; settlement history; China; Loess Plateau; Nei Monggol; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866528813

Quantitative genetic studies that use skeletal cranial measurements as a basis for inferring microevolutionary processes in human populations usually employ heritability estimates to represent the genetic variance of the population. The heritabilities used are often problematic: most come from studies of living humans, and/or they were calculated using statistical techniques or assumptions violated by human groups. Most bilateral breadth measures in the current study show low heritability estimates, while cranial length and height measures have heritability values ranging between 0.102-0.729. There appear to be differences between the heritabilities calculated from crania and those from anthropometric studies of living humans, suggesting that the use of the latter in quantitative genetic models of skeletal data may be inappropriate. The univariate skeletal heritability estimates seem to group into distinct regions of the cranium, based on their relative values. The most salient group of measurements is for the midfacial/orbital region, with a number of measures showing heritabilities less than 0.30. Several possible reasons behind this pattern are examined.

Experimental studies on a wide variety of mammals, including those with retrognathic postcanine teeth, predict that responses to masticatory loading will be greater in the occlusal plane, the inferior rostrum, and regions associated with the attachments of the temporalis and masseter muscles. Here we test these experimentally-derived predictions on an extinct human population from the middle and upper Ohio valley that underwent a marked shift from hunting-gathering to extensive farming during the last 3,000 years and for which we have good archaeological evidence about diet and food processing technology. Geometric morphometric methods were used to detect and measure the putative effect of diet changes on cranial shape independent of size. Our results partially confirm only some of the experimental predictions. The effect of softer and/or less tough diets on craniofacial shape seem to be concentrated in the relative reduction of the temporal fossa and in a displacement of the attachment of the temporal muscle. However, there were few differences in craniofacial shape in regions closer to the occlusal plane. These results highlight the utility of exploring specific localized morphological shifts using a hierarchical model of craniofacial integration. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric-morphometrics; Masticatory stress; Skull shape; Technological transition; Upper-middle Ohio valley","article; craniofacial morphology; food processing; lifestyle modification; mastication; species extinction; temporalis muscle; United States; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-75149123578

However, a formal analysis of diachronic interregional gene flow has not been attempted within a population genetics framework. In this study, cranial measurements of 489 individuals from 13 skeletal samples across the central and lower Illinois valleys are analyzed to address two central issues. First, the potential impact of Cahokia's decline and associated demographic events on the population structure of west-central Illinois Mississippians is examined. Second, the Mississippian and Late Woodland interregional migration patterns are compared to determine if geographic and/or cultural boundaries affected local population structure. Following Relethford and Blangero ([1990] Hum Biol 62:5-25), R matrix methods are utilized to calculate observed and expected phenotypic variances, minimum genetic distances, and FST values in order to detect patterns of differential external gene flow over time. The results indicate that Late Woodland peoples had a larger sphere of biological interaction than Mississippians. In the Mississippian period, culturally imposed barriers paralleled geographic boundaries between regions such that the geographic distribution of biological variation closely adheres to a classic isolation-by-distance model. Further, intraregional population movement was a more significant contributor to Mississippian population structure than interregional gene flow, even during periods of sociopolitical strife. Small-scale intraregional shuffling is consistent with other recent studies of prehistoric Mississippian biocultural and geographic landscapes in the southeast United States. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cranial measurements; Gene flow; Mississippians; Population structure","adolescent; adult; article; female; genetic analysis; genetic model; genetic variability; geographic distribution; human; male; migration; phenotype; population genetics; population structure; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Cultural Characteristics; Emigration and Immigration; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Indians, North American; Male; Middle Aged",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035173505

Much of this difficulty is rooted in the historical use of craniometric data to justify essentialist typological racial classification schemes. In the post-war era of the 'New Physical Anthropology' (sensu Washburn, 1951), anthropologists began to analyse human variation in an explicitly populationist and evolutionary philosophical and analytical framework. However, even within recent decades, substantially different approaches have been employed; some advocate a focus on the analysis of individual traits or clines, while others are explicitly adaptationist, with a focus on natural selection as the preeminent force of phenotypic diversification. In recent years, a series of studies have analysed craniometric data in an explicitly quantitative genetic framework, which emphasises the importance of neutral forces such as migration, gene flow and genetic drift in creating global patterns of phenotypic diversity. This approach has revealed that global patterns of cranial variation can largely be explained on the basis of neutral theory. Therefore, human cranial data can be productively employed as a proxy for neutral genetic data in archaeological contexts. Moreover, there is a growing recognition that regions of the cranium differ in the extent to which they fit a neutral model of microevolutionary expectation, allowing for a more detailed assessment of patterns of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity within the human skull. Taking an historical perspective, the current state of knowledge regarding patterns of cranial adaptation in response to climatic and dietary effects is reviewed. Further insights will be gained by better incorporating the study of cranial and postcranial variation, as well as understanding the impact of neutral versus non-neutral evolution in creating amongspecies diversity patterns in primates more generally. However, this will most effectively be achieved when comparative anatomy studies are situated within an explicitly quantitative genetic evolutionary framework.","Adaptation; Cranial variation; Microevolution; Population history; Quantitative genetics","adaptation; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; climate; evolution; feeding behavior; human; phenotype; physical anthropology; physiology; population genetics; skull; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Biological Evolution; Cephalometry; Climate; Food Habits; Genetics, Population; Humans; Phenotype; Skull",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895168539

The sample consists of 237 crania from the Archaic Late, Early Intermediate, Middle, Late Intermediate, and Late periods. Six metric variables were used, which were transformed to eliminate the special environmental component and to increase the proportion of genetic variance. Population structure was assessed using a method based on quantitative genetic theory, which predicts a lineal relationship between average within-group phenotypic variance and group distance to the population centroid. Results indicate that 17.5% of the total variance accounts for special environmental variance. An excess in extraregional genetic flow is observed in the population corresponding to the Early Intermediate period in the valley. A reduced differentiation is observed between Archaic and Early Intermediate coastal groups, as well as between the latter and the inhabitants of the valley in the same period. Genetic differences between both areas increased substantially since the Middle period. Evidence indicates that long-range gene flow was lower on the coast than in the valley, the lowest estimated Fst being 0.0199 for the total population (coast and valley), 0.0111 for the coastal population, and 0.0057 for the valley.

The middle Holocene strata were well developed on the first terrace of the Hulu River and its tributaries. The paleoenvironment is established by the analyses of sedimentary characteristics, clay minerals, carbonates and pollens in the deposits on the terrace. The climate changes remarkablly affected the ancient civilization in the region. The early Holocene stratum can be seen at the bottom of the first terrace, which mainly consists of alluvial loessic deposits. The clay minerals are mainly illites and the pollens are mainly herbs, which shows a relatively dry and cool paleoclimate. There was no ancient civilization during this period in this region. The early-middle Holocene stratum lies in the lower part of the first terrace, which is mainly composed of alluvial and lacustrine silts and clay. The alluvial gravels can also be found in some places, which indicates a warm and humid paleoclimate. A climate change is found by the sedimentary analyses. It was the warmest and the most humid from 8 000 to 6 000 aBP. The contents of kaolinite and montmorillonite are high. The pollens indicates a wooded grassland or a forest flora of coniferous and broadleaf trees. The favourable natural conditions resulted in the appearances and rapidly development of ancient civilizations. The first stage of Dadiwan civilization (7 800-7 300 aBP) shows some relatively advanced characteristics with big ancient communities (based on the size of the sites), appearances of colourful pottery and agriculture. The early Yangshao civilization (6 800 - 6 000 aBP) shows some developmental features. The communities were still big and the number of communities was increased. From 6 000-5 000 aBP the clay mineral association and the pollen spectrum indicate a slighty dry and cool paleoclimate. The technology of production and pottery making of the middle and late Yangshao civilization during this period had some development, the number of ancient communities were also increased but the size of communities was not increased and some were even decreased. The late middle Holocene (about 5 000-3 000 aBP) stratum mainly consisting of alluvial loessic silts lies in the upper part of the first terrace, representing a distinguish aggradation of loessic silts. The fact that the content of illite increased and the contents of the kaolinite and montmorillonite decreased and the pollen is mainly herbs indicates a drier and cooler paleoclimate. The number and the size of the communities of the Changshan civilization (4 800 -4 200 aBP) decreased. There were some cave like residences. The technology of pottery making had some retrogradation. The communities of Qijia civilization (4 400-3 900 aBP) were widely distributed but the size of them were very small indicating that the civilized area increased but the production of per unit area decreased, and also the proportion of animal husbandry increased. The ancient civilization from 3 900-3 300 aBP has not been found out yet. The Shiwa civilization (about 3 000 aBP) was also very limited in scale. All of these are because of the deterioration of the paleoenvironments during this period.","Hulu River area; Human activity; Middle Holocene; Paleoenvironment","anthropogenic activity; archaeology; Holocene; Holocene river; palaeoclimate; palaeoenvironment; terrace; China, Gansu Province, Hulu River",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030439239

However, the influence of subsistence strategy on global cranial variation is less clear, having been confirmed only for the mandible, and dietary effects beyond agriculture are often neglected. Here we identify global patterns of subsistence-related human cranial shape variation. We analysed a worldwide sample of 15 populations (n=255) with known subsistence strategies using 3-D landmark datasets designed to capture the shape of different units of the cranium. Results show significant correlations between global cranial shape and diet, especially for temporalis muscle shape and general cranial shape. Importantly, the differences between populations with either a plant- or an animal-based diet are more pronounced than those between agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers, suggesting that the influence of diet as driver of cranial variation is not limited to Holocene transitions to agricultural subsistence. Dental arch shape did not correlate with subsistence pattern, possibly indicating the high plasticity of this region of the face in relation to age, disease and individual use of the dentition. Our results highlight the importance of subsistence strategy as one of the factors underlying the evolution of human geographic cranial variation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Diet; Geometric morphometrics; Masticatory adaptation; Partial least squares analysis","adaptation; cranium; diet; Holocene; human evolution; least squares method; morphometry; subsistence; Animalia; agriculture; anatomy and histology; climate; diet; evolution; geography; human; mandible; meat; population dynamics; skull; tooth arch; vegetarian diet; Agriculture; Biological Evolution; Climate; Dental Arch; Diet; Diet, Vegetarian; Geography; Humans; Mandible; Meat; Population Dynamics; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923635241

When environments, societies, and cultures change, diets may also shift. This study traced the extent of dietary change and the factors influencing such change. Through stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis of late Neolithic and early Bronze Age human and animal bone collagen, we found that significant shifts in human diets were closely associated with intercontinental cultural exchanges in Eurasia and climate change in northwestern China. The isotopic evidence indicated that human diets mainly consisted of C4 foodstuffs (presumably millet and/or animals fed with C4 foods) around 4000 calibrated years before the present (cal yr BP), corresponding to the flourishing of millet agriculture in the context of the optimal climate conditions of the mid-Holocene. Subsequently, more C3 foods (probably wheat, barley, and animals fed with C3 foods) were added to human diets post-3600 cal yr BP when the climate became cooler and drier. Such dietary variation is also consistent with the increasing intensity of long-distance exchange after 4000 cal yr BP. While many factors can lead to human dietary shifts (e.g. climate change, population growth, cultural factors, and human migration), climate may have been a key factor in Gansu and Qinghai. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Barley; Climate change; Millet; Northwestern China; Paleodiet; Stable isotopes; Wheat","Animals; Carbon; Isotopes; Nutrition; Population statistics; Barley; Millet; Northwestern China; Paleodiet; Stable isotopes; Wheat; Climate change; barley; Bronze Age; climate change; dietary shift; environmental factor; human behavior; millet; natural resource; Neolithic; resource availability; stable isotope; wheat; China; Eurasia; Gansu; Qinghai; Animalia; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973401145

Among both Late Archaic hunter-gatherers and Late Prehistoric horticulturists, covariance structures for cranial metrics were found to be homogenous within the populations, but the Late Archaic subpopulations showed little differentiation while the Late Prehistoric subpopulations exhibited a marked differentiation. Biodistance based on cranial discrete trait frequency showed similar patterns, but in the Late Archaic discrete trait distance was associated significantly with the geographical distance separating populations. The present investigation is an extension of the previous studies increasing the Late Prehistoric sample (n = 8 samples and n = 341 individuals) and using the Harpending-Ward model, modified for use with multivariate quantitative data, to estimate the effects of differential gene flow and the amount of differentiation within populations. Results of the present analyses indicate that differentiation among subpopulations, measured by minimum F(ST), was greater in the Late Prehistoric compared to the Late Archaic period. However, for both periods the minimum F(ST) is comparable to Values found for historic native populations of the northeast woodlands. Analysis of differential gene flow in the Late Archaic period indicates that geographically peripheral populations were affected more by external gene flow than more central populations. Late Prehistoric populations exhibit a very complex pattern of differential gene flow. We discuss the latter pattern in terms of proposed culture change in the Late Prehistoric period of Ohio.

In particular, it is unclear whether high levels of between-group craniometric diversity in South America result from multiple migrations or from local diversification processes. Previous attempts to explain this diversity have largely focused on testing alternative dispersal or gene flow models, reaching conflicting or inconclusive results. Here, a novel analytical framework is applied to three-dimensional geometric morphometric data to partition the effects of population divergence from geographically mediated gene flow to understand the ancestry of the early South Americans in the context of global human history. The results show that Paleoamericans share a last common ancestor with contemporary Native American groups outside, rather than inside, the Americas. Therefore, and in accordance with some recent genomic studies, craniometric data suggest that the New World was populated by multiple waves of dispersion from northeast Asia throughout the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved;",,"Genes; Cranial morphology; Early Holocene; Evolutionary population; Genomic studies; Geometric morphometric; Late Pleistocene; Multiple waves; Native Americans; Population statistics; American Indian; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; female; history; human; male; skull; South America; Cephalometry; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Skull; South America",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024503877

The extent to which this transition is associated with biological changes in different world regions remains debated. Cultural and osteological records in Lower Nubia throughout the Holocene have been interpreted as a result of in situ differentiation or alternatively as migratory events and possible admixture with surrounding populations. Here we investigated the patterns of craniofacial and mandibular variation from Mesolithic hunting-gathering to late farming, a period spanning 11,000 years. We analyzed 102 adult specimens spanning five cultural horizons: Mesolithic, A-group, C-group, Pharaonic and Meroitic, by means of 3D geometric morphometric methods, in order to assess shape variation and diachronic patterns at the transition to farming and in subsequent periods. Our results highlight a strong morphometric distinction between Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and farmers as well as differences between transitional and intensive farmers in mandibular variation which is consistent with differential impact of selective pressures on different regions of the skull. This study corroborates a major biological change during the transition from hunting to farming, supporting the masticatory-functional hypothesis for the mandible and suggesting population continuity among farming populations throughout the Holocene based on the overall shape of the cranium. © The Author(s) 2016.",,"adult; agricultural worker; Holocene; human; human tissue; mandible; Mesolithic; agriculture; analysis of variance; anatomic model; anatomy and histology; Egypt; facial bone; female; fossil; history; male; mandible; paleontology; population dynamics; skull; Sudan; Adult; Agriculture; Analysis of Variance; Egypt; Facial Bones; Female; Fossils; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Mandible; Models, Anatomic; Paleontology; Population Dynamics; Skull; Sudan",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981268393

However, the extent of genetic contributions to normal variation in craniofacial morphology in humans is still unclear. The current study addresses this gap by investigating the genetic underpinnings of normal craniofacial morphology. The sample under investigation consists of 75 linear and angular measurements spanning the entire craniofacial complex, recorded from lateral cephalographs of 1,379 participants in the Fels Longitudinal Study. Heritabilities for each trait were estimated using SOLAR, a maximum-likelihood variance components approach utilizing all pedigree information for parameter estimation. Trait means and mean effects of the covariates age, sex, age2, sex × age, and sex × age2 were simultaneously estimated in the analytic models. All traits of the craniofacial complex were significantly heritable. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.10 to 0.60, with the majority being moderate. It is important to note that we found similar ranges of heritability occurring across the different functional/developmental components of the craniofacial complex, the splanchnocranium, the basicranium, and the neurocranium. This suggests that traits from different regions of the craniofacial complex are of comparable utility for the purposes of population history and phylogeny reconstruction. At the same time, this genetic influence on craniofacial morphology signals a caution to researchers of nongenetic studies to consider the implications of this finding when selecting samples for study given their project design and goals. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Craniofacial morphology; Heritability; Phylogeny reconstruction; Population history","adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; craniofacial morphology; female; heritability; human; investigative procedures; longitudinal study; male; medical information; middle aged; normal human; pedigree; phenotype; phenotypic variation; phylogeny; priority journal; school child; very elderly; young adult; age; anatomic landmark; biological model; bone development; cephalometry; facial bone; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; heredity; population genetics; quantitative trait; radiography; sex difference; skull; statistical model; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anatomic Landmarks; Bone Development; Cephalometry; Child; Facial Bones; Female; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genotype; Heredity; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Genetic; Pedigree; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Sex Factors; Skull; Young Adult",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938959067

The patterns and intensity of shape covariation, and how this is related to diet, are essential for understanding the evolution of functional masticatory adaptations of the human cranium. Within a worldwide sample (n=255) of 15 populations with different modes of subsistence, we use partial least squares analysis to study the relationships between three components of the MA: upper dental arch, masseter muscle, and temporalis muscle attachments. We show that the shape of the masseter muscle and the shape of the temporalis muscle clearly covary with one another, but that the shape of the dental arch seems to be rather independent of the masticatory muscles. On the contrary, when relative positioning, orientation, and size of the masticatory components is included in the analysis, the dental arch shows the highest covariation with the other cranial parts, indicating that these additional factors are more important than just shape with regard to covariation within the MA. Covariation patterns among these cranial regions differ mainly between hunting-fishing and gathering-agriculture groups, possibly relating to greater masticatory strains resulting from a large meat component in the diet. High-strain groups show stronger covariation between upper dental arch and masticatory muscle shape when compared with low-strain groups. These results help to provide a clearer understanding of constraints and interlinkage of shape variation within the human MA and allow for more realistic modeling and predictions in future biomechanical studies.

Striking familial facial similarities underscore a genetic component, but little is known of the genes that underlie facial shape differences. Numerous studies have estimated facial shape heritability using various methods. Here, we used advanced three-dimensional imaging technology and quantitative human genetics analysis to estimate narrow-sense heritability, heritability explained by common genetic variation, and pairwise genetic correlations of 38 measures of facial shape and size in normal African Bantu children from Tanzania. Specifically, we fit a linear mixed model of genetic relatedness between close and distant relatives to jointly estimate variance components that correspond to heritability explained by genome-wide common genetic variation and variance explained by uncaptured genetic variation, the sum representing total narrow-sense heritability. Our significant estimates for narrow-sense heritability of specific facial traits range from 28 to 67%, with horizontal measures being slightly more heritable than vertical or depth measures. Furthermore, for over half of facial traits, >90%of narrow-sense heritability can be explained by common genetic variation. We also find high absolute genetic correlation between most traits, indicating large overlap in underlying genetic loci. Not surprisingly, traits measured in the same physical orientation (i.e., both horizontal or both vertical) have high positive genetic correlations, whereas traits in opposite orientations have high negative correlations. The complex genetic architecture of facial shape informs our understanding of the intricate relationships among different facial features as well as overall facial development. © 2017 by the Genetics Society of America.","Complex traits; Facial shape; Facial size; Heritability; Morphometrics","adolescent; adult; age distribution; Article; Bantu people; child; face; face development; facies; female; gene locus; genetic correlation; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; heritability; human; male; morphometry; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; quantitative analysis; school child; Tanzania; three dimensional imaging; young adult; anatomy and histology; anthropometry; face; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; maxillofacial development; quantitative trait; Adolescent; Anthropometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Face; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Humans; Maxillofacial Development; Phenotype; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Young Adult",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021848727

This study analyzes the craniofacial size and shape variation of diachronic samples from the study region to test distinct population history scenarios that support continuity or, alternatively, divergence. Materials and methods: A total of 92 adult skulls belonging to five chronological groups, ranging from c. 10,100 to 350 14C YBP, were analyzed through Procrustean geometric morphometric techniques. Matrix correlation analysis, multivariate exploratory (PCA, FDA), and evolutionary quantitative genetic methods (R-matrix analysis and β-test) were used to study the diachronic craniofacial shape variation. Results: A model that supports strong evolutionary diversification over the Holocene better explains the patterns of morphological variation observed. At least two periods of significant craniofacial size and shape change were detected: one during the middle to initial late Holocene transition (c. 4,000–3,200 14C YBP) and other toward the final late Holocene (post-2,000 14C YBP), which exhibit differences in the pattern and magnitude of cranial divergence. In addition, the differentiation viewed between early and mid-Holocene foragers could mark the initial entry of non-local populations into the region toward the beginnings of the middle Holocene. Discussion: Distinct to previous investigations the present study supports a more complex regional population history where multiple population contractions/extinctions, dispersals and assimilations along with dietary adaptations took place during the last 10,000 years. These results are in agreement with the archaeological and paleoecological record which suggests marked periods of change rather than temporal stability. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","biocultural discontinuity; Bogotá highplain; geometric morphometrics; Holocene; skull morphology","adult; correlation analysis; diet; differentiation; exploratory research; forager; Late Holocene; model; morphology; morphometrics; muscle contractility; nonhuman; quantitative study; skull; South America; American Indian; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; Colombia; evolution; face; female; history; human; male; skull; Adult; Biological Evolution; Cephalometry; Colombia; Face; Female; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996931199

These aggregated tribes, known as Xiongnu (3rd century BC to the 2nd century AD), came to define steppe polity construction, later used by the Mongol Empire under the reign of Genghis Khan. They moved extensively over the eastern steppe and interacted, both in trade and intermarriage, with peoples from southern Siberia to Xinjiang. However, the Xiongnu as a people are relatively unknown to scholars, as they did not possess a written language. This study assesses Xiongnu population history and biological structure by analyzing craniofacial diversity via geometric morphometrics. Twenty-four coordinate cranial landmarks were used to test relationships among groups in the region and infer potential biological origins. The Relethford-Blangero R-matrix method was used to test hypotheses of phenotypic variation resulting from microevolutionary processes. This study hypothesizes biological continuity among Xiongnu individuals extending into modern Mongolian populations. Alternatively, long-range gene flow from adjacent geographic regions might suggest a complex population structure among the Xiongnu indicative of multiple populations controlling administrative functions. Results indicate the Xiongnu were potentially composed of at least two biologically distinct groups. Individuals from the elite cemetery of Borkhan Tolgoi (Egiin Gol) share their ancestry with a Bronze Age population from western Mongolia, and possibly, to a later migration of Turks, who came to rule the eastern steppe from the 6th to 8th centuries AD. The Xiongnu also evidence biological similarity with nomads from the Mongol Empire during the medieval period and modern Mongolians, as well as modern and ancient Central Asian, Chinese, and Siberian groups. These results are similar to ancient DNA studies that suggest a mix of Eastern and Western Eurasian haplogroups in the Xiongnu while also achieving consensus with models of steppe polity formation proposed by archaeologists who suggest local ties to extra-local groups through interactive exchange networks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Geometric morphometrics; Inner Asia; Iron Age; Population structure; Quantitative genetics; R matrix","gene flow; Iron Age; matrix; morphometry; nomadic people; population genetics; population structure; Mongolia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919360442

We assume that groups' geographical distances correlate with genetic and, therefore, morphological distances between them. Materials and Methods: Material includes complete male crania from several Mesolithic and Neolithic burial sites across Northern Eurasia and from several modern populations. Geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistical techniques are applied to explore morphological trends, group distances, and correlations with their geographical position, climate, and the time of origin. Results: Despite an overlap in the morphology among the modern and archeological groups, some of them show significant morphological distances. Geographical parameters account for only a small proportion of cranial variation in the sample, with larger variance explained by geography and age together. Expectations of isolation by distance are met in some but not in all cases. Climate accounts for a large proportion of autocorrelation with geography. Nearest-neighbor joining trees demonstrate group relationships predicted by the regression on geography and on climate. Discussion: The obtained results are discussed in application to relationships between particular groups. Unlike the Ukrainian Mesolithic, the Yuzhny Oleni Ostrov Mesolithic displays a high morphological affinity with several groups from Northern Eurasia of both European and Asian origin. A possibility of a common substrate for the Yuzhny Oleni Ostrov Mesolithic and Siberian Neolithic groups is reviewed. The Siberian Neolithic is shown to have morphological connection with both modern Siberian groups and the Native North Americans. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cranium; geometric morphometrics; Mesolithic; Neolithic; population history","burial; climate; controlled study; expectation; genetic isolation by distance; geography; human; Mesolithic; morphology; morphometry; Neolithic; North American; skull; anatomy and histology; ancestry group; anthropometry; demography; history; male; physical anthropology; principal component analysis; skull; statistics and numerical data; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Continental Population Groups; Demography; History, Ancient; Humans; Male; Principal Component Analysis; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021271178
