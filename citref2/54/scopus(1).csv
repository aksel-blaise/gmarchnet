Box 28147, San Antonio, TX 78284, United States","A major goal in anthropological genetics is the assessment of the effects of different microevolutionary forces. Harpending and Ward (1982) developed a model that aids in this effort by comparing observed and expected heterozygosity within populations in a local region. The expected heterozygosity within a population is a function of the total heterozygosity of the entire region and the distance of the population from the regional mean centroid of allele frequencies. Greater than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having greater heterozygosity than expected. Less than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having less heterozygosity than expected. We extend the Harpending-Ward model to quantitative traits using an equal and additive effects model of inheritance. Here the additive genetic variance within a population is directly proportional to heterozygosity, and its expectation is directly proportional to the genetic distance from the centroid. Under certain assumptions the expectations for phenotypic variances are similar. Observed and expected genetic or phenotypic variance can then be compared to assess the effects of differential external gene flow. When the additive genetic covariance matrix or heritabilities are not known, the phenotypic covariance matrix can be used to provide a conservative application of the model. In addition, we develop new methods for estimation of the genetic relationship matrix (R) from quantitative traits. We apply these models to two data sets: (1) six principal components derived from twenty dermatoglyphic ridge count measures for nine villages in Nepal and (2) ten anthropometric measurements for seven isolated populations in western Ireland. In both cases both the univariate and multivariate analyses provide results that can be directly interpreted in terms of historically known patterns of gene flow.",,"anthropometry; conference paper; heterozygosity; human; india; ireland; mathematical model; population research; quantitative assay; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Dermatoglyphics; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Human; Models, Genetic; Nepal; Northern Ireland; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Variation (Genetics)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025144359

However, this has yet to be analyzed at a global level. Here, the relationship between global mandibular shape variation and subsistence economy is tested, while controlling for the potentially confounding effects of shared population history, geography, and climate. The results demonstrate that the mandible, in contrast to the cranium, significantly reflects subsistence strategy rather than neutral genetic patterns, with hunter-gatherers having consistently longer and narrower mandibles than agriculturalists. These results support notions that a decrease in masticatory stress among agriculturalists causes the mandible to grow and develop differently. This developmental argument also explains why there is often a mismatch between the size of the lower face and the dentition, which, in turn, leads to increased prevalence of dental crowding and malocclusions in modern postindustrial populations. Therefore, these results have important implications for our understanding of human masticatory adaptation.","Diet; Mastication; Phenotypic plasticity; Skull","agriculture; animal hunting; article; climate; cold; dentition; economic aspect; face; fishing; genetics; geography; history; human; malocclusion; mandible; mastication; masticatory muscle; maxilla; palate; priority journal; skull; thermoregulation; Adaptation, Physiological; Agriculture; Animal Husbandry; Biological Evolution; Diet; Female; Humans; Life Style; Male; Mandible; Models, Anatomic; Sex Factors; Skull; Stomatognathic System; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-83755183406

A review of ethnohistorical sources in conjunction with a human osteological study of cranial shape modification offers original data regarding diversity in Tiwanaku society, which was situated in the southern Andes from ca. AD 500-1100. The study sample includes 412 individuals from the site of Tiwanaku, surrounding sites in the Tiwanaku and Katari valleys, and Tiwanaku-affiliated sites in the Moquegua valley of southern Peru. A distinct regional pattern is clear in the ways in which head form was modified. In the Moquegua valley, solely fronto-occipital modification was employed, while in the Katari valley a distinctly different, annular modification was practiced. In contrast, individuals interred in the capital city of Tiwanaku displayed both head form styles. These results suggest that diverse groups of people from neighboring areas were drawn to the Tiwanaku capital in the highlands, and cranial shape modification was involved in symbolic boundary maintenance at the juncture of two distinct environmental niches, the precise location of the capital site of Tiwanaku. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Although advancements in DNA analysis have overshadowed other areas of progress in the subfields of biological anthropology, bioarchaeologists are now utilizing many other new forms of technology in their work. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning offers a sophisticated method of documenting and studying prehistoric human skeletons. In recent years, portable laser scanning devices capable of creating high resolution images have become available, enabling researchers to scan and archive skeletal collections from archaeological sites and museum collections around the world. 3D laser scanners are inexpensive, simple to operate, and completely non-destructive to human skeletal material. A major benefit is that they offer a cost-effective method of creating a digital record of skeletal collections for museum archives. Since published research using 3D methods typically focuses on sophisticated analyses used to analyze 3D data that are difficult for the novice user to follow, in this paper we provide a simple and straightforward overview of 3D scanning methods aimed at non-specialists. We discuss how these methods can be used to preserve and document osteological material in museums, develop research ideas in the subfields of biological anthropology, and increase the potential for scholarly collaboration. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Archaeological methods; Bioarchaeology; Museum conservation; Three-dimensional laser scanning methods; Virtual anthropology","anthropology; archaeology; DNA; laser method; museum; three-dimensional modeling",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862181849

Biological estimates of this change have traditionally relied upon biodistance estimates, using craniofacial measures of both deformed and nondeformed skulls. In order to evaluate whether large-scale prehistoric migrations occurred in the Azapa Valley, we examine biodistance results from non-metric cranial traits for eight mortuary samples that represent all time periods of prehistoric occupation of the valley. None of the mean measures of divergences (MMD) among mortuary samples examined by this study were significant. These results suggest biological continuity in the Azapa Valley during 5,000 years of prehistory, with nonsignificant gene flow during the late Middle Horizon (AD 750-1100) and Late Intermediate (AD 1100-1476) periods. Biodistance results also suggest endogamy within coastal and inland populations.

Four hundred and fifteen skulls, representing a period of 7000 years, were examined of which 88.9 per cent were deformed. The practice was carried out equally between men and women. The techniques used in head deforming varied over time among the different cultural groups that inhabited the region. By analysis of the methods used in ACD, it can be demonstrated that head deforming may yield information significant to the study of the political and cultural changes that occurred throughout the prehistory of the region. As a form of stylistic behaviour, which may be viewed as a strategy of information exchange, ACD was found to be a significant cultural artifact that may serve to mark territory or social boundaries, reaffirm ethnicity, and maintain and strengthen exchange networks. Certain pathological consequences were found to be the result of ACD, including an increase in the prevalence of wormian bones, occipital bone necrosis, and an abnormal closing pattern of the cranial sutures. No evidence was found that ACD is associated with a deviated nasal septum or osteomas of the external auditory canal.

Acknowledging vault modifications, researchers have sought measurements in other regions which are unaffected by deformation. In the 1970s, a set of 10 ""relatively"" unaffected facial measurements was identified in Argentinean crania that later became the basis of numerous South American biodistance studies. These measurements include: minimum frontal breadth, bizygomatic breadth, orbit height, orbit breadth, palate breath, palate length, upper facial height, basion-prosthion length, nasal height, and nasal breadth. Palate length was excluded from the present analysis due to considerable measurement error. The suitability of these measurements in populations other than Argentineans has not been rigorously tested. Using a sample of 350 prehistoric crania from the Museo Arqueológico San Miguel de Azapa (MASMA, Arica, Chile), this project tested the hypothesis that these measurements are unaffected by either annular or tabular deformation. Results obtained from MANOVA analysis indicate this hypothesis cannot be fully supported. Among males, only 3 of the 9 measurements are unaffected by either form of deformation (palate breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth), while analysis of females indicates that 4 of the 9 measurements remain unaltered (minimum frontal breadth, orbit breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth). Additionally, analogous to the vault, facial measurements display patterns consistent with the deformation applied. Two implications can be drawn from this research: 1) previous studies using these measurements must be interpreted cautiously, and 2) researchers using these measurements must explicitly test their suitability in each population. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Artificial; Biodistance; Craniofacial; Face; Intentional; South America","Argentina; article; calculation; Chile; craniofacial morphology; face malformation; geological time; measurement; multivariate analysis of variance; palate; population distribution; skull malformation; Cephalometry; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Facial Bones; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Skull; South America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746217091

Cranial variation related to artificial deformation of human cranial remains is analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistic methods. The results of this work show that there are no large differences in variation among states, chiefdoms and bands of hunter-gatherers.

The skeletons found at this site were ascribed to the Early to Middle Holocene and represented the oldest known population of Western South America, and thus were used in several studies addressing the early population history of the continent. However, later excavations at Lauricocha led to doubts regarding the antiquity of the site. Here, we provide new dating, craniometric, and genetic evidence for this iconic site. We obtained new radiocarbon dates, generated complete mitochondrial genomes and nuclear SNP data from five individuals, and re-analyzed the human remains of Lauricocha to revise the initial morphological and craniometric analysis conducted in the 1960's. We show that Lauricocha was indeed occupied in the Early to Middle Holocene but the temporal spread of dates we obtained from the human remains show that they do not qualify as a single contemporaneous population. However, the genetic results from five of the individuals fall within the spectrum of genetic diversity observed in pre-Columbian and modern Native Central American populations. © 2015 Fehren-Schmitz et al.

These remains are from Acha-3, a site 5.4 km from the coastline at the confluence of the Acha ravine and Azapa valley. Findings from Acha-3 (a) define funerary, technological, and economic patterns for the Early Archaic (9,000-8,000 B.C.) with strong Chinchorro tradition connections, (b) demonstrate a subsistence strategy adapted to the marine ecosystem by means of associated bioarchaeological data, and (c) identify the oldest funerary site known for the lowlands of the south-central Andes. Two radiocarbon dates place Acha-3 at the end of the Early Archaic period and link it, culturally as well as chronologically, to Acha-2, a campsite. A burial at Acha-3 contains three individuals wearing headbands fabricated from camelid and plant fibers. The bodies were wrapped with camelid and sea lion skins and decorated plant fiber mats in an elaborate funerary bundle, with few offerings. Although there are no signs of artificial mummification, the clear intention to straighten and stiffen the bodies in elaborate funerary bundles, the multiple extended inhumations, and the associated cultural elements suggest that Acha-3 treatments were local precursors to Chinchorro funerary practices.

There was a negative correlation between δ15N and δ13C for coastal sites, but a positive correlation for valley sites. Results for the valley sites point to a diet that was influenced by marine resources throughout all time periods. The unusually heavy δ15N values for the coastal sites require a dietary component with a δ15N composition significantly heavier than that of marine resources. The hyper-aridity at the study area (mean annual rainfall of 0.5-0.6mm/year) is a likely contributing factor to the production of heavy δ15N values, but is unlikely to account for the heaviest δ15N values (&gt;+30‰). One possible explanation for the heaviest δ15N values is that dietary components were impacted by isotopically-heavy guano, which is abundant in the region. Guano may have been used as a fertilizer during crop cultivation at the onset of the Formative period, continuing through the Historic period after Spanish contact. The indirect impact of guano from abundant bird habitats in the region may have influenced wild foodstuffs harvested throughout the pre-agricultural period. Results provide support for the utility of dental calculus as a proxy for obtaining stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures for use in paleodietary studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioarchaeology; Carbon; Chile prehistory; Dental calculus; Nitrogen; Paleodiet; Seabird guano; Stable isotopes","carbon isotope; dentition; diet; guano; Holocene; nitrogen isotope; paleoenvironment; prehistoric; resource allocation; stable isotope; Chile; Aves",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882692839

This paper presents the results of bioarchaeological and archaeological chemical analyses of the skeletal remains of an adult male (tomb 50, catalog number 1948) from the cemetery of Solcor 3 (ca. AD 500-900). Strontium isotope ratios in human tooth enamel reveal information about where a person lived during their childhood, when enamel was being formed. Individual 1948 showed strontium isotope ratios decidedly outside the range of the local San Pedro de Atacama strontium isotope signature. Given these data implying that individual 1948 was originally from elsewhere, an examination of his health status, social role, and mortuary context provides insight into the treatment of foreigners in San Pedro de Atacama. Our data support the argument that individual 1948's foreign birth did not hinder his later assimilation into Atacameño society. He was buried in a local cemetery with a typical mortuary assemblage for a male of this time and no strong evidence of possible foreign origin. Skeletal indicators of diet and activity patterns do not distinguish individual 1948 from the local population, suggesting that his lifestyle was similar to that of other Atacameños. Therefore, our analyses suggest that individual 1948's acculturation into Atacameño society during his adult life was nearly complete and he retained little to no indication of his probable foreign birth.","Acculturation; Bone chemistry; Paleopathology; South Central Andes; Strontium isotope analysis; Tiwanaku; Trace element analysis",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-42049084390

Here, we test the hypothesis that, despite the major shift in social and political organization at the fall of theWari empire, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) composition of populations from the Ayacucho Basin, the former imperial heartland of the empire, remained essentially unchanged. Results show that mtDNA haplogroup frequencies among the Wari and post-Wari groups differ, but the difference is not statistically significant (χ2 = 5.886, df = 3, P = 0.1172). This is the first study in the Andes to use haplotypic data to evaluate the observed genetic distance between two temporally distinct prehispanic populations (FST = 0.029) against modeled expectations of four possible evolutionary scenarios. None of these simulations allowed the rejection of continuity. In total, at both the haplogroup and haplotype levels these data do not allow us to reject the hypothesis that post-Wari individuals sampled in this study are the maternal descendants of those sampled from the Wari era site of Conchopata. However, genetic homogeneity in the mitochondrial gene pool, as seen in the late prehispanic southern Andes, may also characterize our study region. But, prior to this research, this was unknown. If our new data show mtDNA homogeneity, then this could limit the detection of female migration if, in fact, it occurred. Nonetheless, the novel mtDNA data presented here currently do not support the hypothesis that there was an influx of genetically distinct females into the former Wari heartland after the Wari collapse. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Ancient DNA; Bioarchaeology; Huari; mtDNA; Peru","mitochondrial DNA; article; controlled study; gene pool; genetic analysis; haplotype; human; mitochondrial gene; molecular evolution; politics; population dynamics; population research; social structure; South America; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; History, Medieval; Humans; Indians, South American; Peru; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949119684

Wear rate and plane (angle) were additionally evaluated using a subsample of paired first and second mandibular molars. The Formative period represents the transition from marine foraging to agro-pastoral dependence in the region, and differences in oral pathology indicate that diet varied by site location (coast vs valley interior) but not by archaeological phase (early vs late). We predicted that occlusal wear would demonstrate similar patterns, resulting from differences in food consistency, and therefore hypothesised that in coastal groups consuming greater quantities of foraged foods, occlusal surfaces should wear faster and exhibit flat molar wear, whereas among valley interior groups consuming greater quantities of agro-pastoral products, these should wear slower but exhibit more angled molar wear. Heavier posterior tooth wear was identified among coastal residents, but rate and angle of molar occlusal attrition did not differ significantly by location. Heavier overall wear and a steeper molar wear plane were identified during the early phase indicating that food consistency varied somewhat over the course of the Formative period. Overall, the results indicate that, although limited differences in tooth wear exist by site location, wear varied more over time likely reflecting a gradual transition from foraging to agro-pastoral dependence in the lower Azapa Valley. Although oral health indicators point to differences in dietary investment by location, maintenance of a mixed subsistence economy likely sustained a comparative consistency of foodstuffs. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Chile; Formative period; Marine foraging; Occlusal wear plane; Tooth wear",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879090777

In northern Chile it was extensively done during five thousand years by populations which inhabited the Coast and Valleys from Arica. In spite of the importance that the study of this practice has had in anthropological research, biocultural remains such as hear, mould and textils preclude the morphometric analyses commonly performed onto the clean skull. In order to avoid these limitations and to know the pattern of skull shape variation, geometric morphometric methody and craneoficial radiographic technics were applied on non deformed and intentionally deformed samples of Arica's archaeological populations. As a control sample radiographs obtained from modern Chileans were used. Radiographic and geometric morphometric evidences here presented show that: (1) variation of skull shape components of intentionally deformed crania is explained by both the force and the direction of the deforming devices originally applied, (2) intentional deformation affects anatomical landmarks located in the neurocrania as well the face, (3) there would be a morphological continuity among populations representatives of Archaic and Agro-ceramic cultural traditions. The role of geometric morphometric and radiographic technics to asses the problem of intentional cranial deformation in archaeological and modern human populations as well as the discrepancy between our results and the results obtained by means of the traditional morphometric methods are discussed.","Arica-Chile; Geometric morphometrics; Intentional cranial deformation; Radiography",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746113110

Given the dramatic differencesbetween the two cultural eras, we examine how cultural and climatic conditions shaped human activities, particularly as they relate to violence against children, childhood diet, and residential mobility. Did the decline of Wari stateinfrastructure and the severe drought of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries contribute to poormorbidity among subadults, particularly as it related to violence-related trauma and changes in food access? The Wari empirewas the first expansive empire in South America, and it maintained a mosaic of control from the northern Andes of Peru, to the centralPeruvian coast, to the Moquegua Valley in the far south (Schreiber 1992). Afterfour centuries ofrule, the Wari empire “collapsed” for reasons that are still not fully understood, though it could be related to internal competition at the end of the Middle Horizon (Tung 2014) combined with a severe drought that may have began as early as 900 C.E.

Visual images in different media, including rock art, represent one of the ways in which these complex relationships take place. While in the New World few comparative analyses of archaeofaunal and visual data have been addressed, in the Old World these studies have been framed by a dichotomist view between drawn (thought) and consumed (eaten) understanding, both terms as separate and disconnected social realms. This view also structures an abstract, non-pragmatic, rather passive, world drawn in art, against a concrete, practical, active world of consumption. The analysis we present here, based on principles of substantive economy theory, explores the relation between humans and animals in the prehistory of the Atacama Desert (ca. 13,000-410. BP), by comparing visual images of fauna depicted in rock art (engravings and paintings) with archaeofaunal remains from domestic and funerary contexts. The dataset (comprised of 1534 archaeofaunal items and 729 rock art animal motifs from 117 sites) was standardized by calculating the percentage of ubiquity of each animal item per period of time, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to identify synchronic and diachronic changes in the relative importance of certain animals consumed. We observed important temporal and contextual variations in the consumption of animals drawn in rock art in the Atacama Desert, and we conclude that they reflect a selection of a wide range of ritual and utilitarian, but not mutually exclusive, functions. In particular, images of camelids emphasized the importance of providing fiber for the creation of textile artifacts and camelid use as pack animals in the caravan trade, both activities that were fundamental in the economy of local societies. © 2015 The Authors.","Archaeofauna; Atacama Desert; Consumption; Rock art; Zoomorphic motifs",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942807642

In this article skeletal remains dated 9000-4000 BP, excavated from archaeological sites in northern, central and southern Chile, were analyzed using geometric morphometric and ancient mtDNA techniques. Results indicate that the ancient cranial material from southwestern South America exhibit a wide range of cranial vault shape variation which is independent of chronology. mtDNA restriction and sequence analysis performed on the same skeletal remains, revealed only the presence of the main four founding mtDNA haplogroups (A, B, C and D) as early as 9,000 BP. Our results using morphometric and molecular mtDNA haplogroup data show that human populations inhabiting the Americas during archaic times can not be considered as belonging to two different groups on the basis of analyzed data. These results are consistent with those recently obtained using complete sequence mtDNA analyses.","Ancient mtDNA; Geometric morphometrics; Paleoindian and archaic crania; Peopling of America",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84055176660

C.-A.D. 500) skeletons from archaeological sites located in the Lower Azapa Valley of northwest Chile. This period represents a major shift in subsistence strategies in the Atacama Desert, as coastal groups adopted agriculture and moved deeper into the valley. Frequencies of caries and antemortem tooth loss were compared between site locations (coast vs. valley) and by archaeological phase (early vs. late) to interpret the degree to which these incipient agriculturalists were reliant on domesticated resources. Overall, frequencies of caries (11.9 percent) and tooth loss (11.6 percent) are somewhat higher than for other prehistoric groups practicing a mixed subsistence strategy. However, residents of the interior valley exhibited significantly more dental decay and tooth loss than those along the coast. Our results identify that although the Formative period residents of the Lower Azapa Valley practiced a mixed subsistence strategy, the degree of reliance on agricultural production differed between the coast and the valley.

The direction of normal cranial growth is altered through the application of external forces. In this study, three types of ACM from north-central Peru (posterior flattening, bilobed and circumferential) were analysed using standard craniometric techniques. The aim was to determine the effects of these forms of ACM on craniofacial morphology, and the extent to which different types of ACM could be distinguished from one another and unmodified crania on the basis of these measurements. Significant differences between artificially modified and unmodified crania, and between different types of ACM, were demonstrated in cranial vault shape for all types. Significant differences in facial morphology were found only in the bilobed group compared with the unmodified crania. Canonical variates analysis (discriminant analysis) confirmed that major differences between modification types and unmodified crania were in measurements and angles of the cranial vault. While the results show some similarities to previous studies, they add to the variability in the patterns and extent of differences documented to date. It is suggested, based on these results and visual observations, that interpopulation variation in ACM within major modification categories may explain some of the variability in results between studies, an explanation which has previously received insufficient recognition but which remains to be tested since varied methodology between studies may also be a contributory factor.

Sulfur isotopes were useful to decipher some cases where carbon and nitrogen did not detect significant consumption of terrestrial resources. These isotopic results confirm that the exploitation of marine resources was the main activity for the inhabitants of the Formative Period, a time of neolithization process in south central Andes. This contradicts previous assumptions on the speed of the shift from the exploitation of marine to terrestrial resources, suggesting that this transition did not impact the subsistence strategies of this population as fast as previously thought. Therefore the ""neolithization"" of populations during this period did not lead to a significant change in diet. In this paper we present data from fifteen individuals, of which thirteen had a diet mainly based on marine resources, while two showed a more terrestrial-based diet. These different cases among individuals in relation to different access to resources are discussed. Moreover, the results are compared with those obtained from other contemporaneous Chilean sites of the same geographical area. This investigation on mummified hair samples offers new palaeodiet insights into the prehistoric subsistence strategies in northern Chile during a key transitional period. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon; Formative period; Hair; Nitrogen; Palaeodiet; Stable isotope analysis; Sulfur",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966664950

They were donated to the collections at the beginning of the 20th century. A multidisciplinary team is now curating and studying them. CT scans confirmed both skeletons were of individuals less than one year old at death. One of the bundles is intact and will be preserved and displayed. The other one was partly decomposed and the authors received permission to unwrap it to analyze the bones in details. Mites and pollen analysis were performed and the bones and artifacts were described. The cranium of a four to six month-old child, had a perforated necrotic occipital bone that possibly related to cause of death. Endosteal new bone reaction, a flattened area at the occipital squamae and a parietal sulcus associated with a zone of frontparietal resorption were also found. A pathognomonic periosteal reaction at the occipital and parietals, along the lambdoid suture, pointed to the compression of the skull that could explain the trauma, ischemic necrosis and subsequent infection. The cultural context suggests that the bundle could belong to a late Inca burial. © 2009 Universidad de Tarapacá Facultad de Ciencias Sociales Administrativas y Económicas Departamento de Antropología.","Chillon River; Paleopathology; Peru; Prehistory; Skull deformation; Skull necrosis",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69149110939

To Imbelloni's classification of Tabular erecta, Tabular obliqua, and Annular I add a new type, Cuneiform, marked by flattening of the entire occiput (not just the upper, membraneous‐derived bone) without evidence of counter pressure in front. The Cuneiform type starts in Guayas about 2000 B.C. (perhaps the earliest in America) with diffusion to coastal Peru in Chavin times. Tabular erecta, of coastal origin between Manabi province and the Guyas river basin, about 1,000 B.C., also spreads to coastal Peru. Tabular obliqua appears in Esmeraldas province probably from Mexico 2000 years ago, and diffuses south into Chile. Annular type starts early in the Southern Andes and appears late in the highlands of Ecuador.

This is attempted here through a study of dismembered body parts that, as I argue, remained socially and politically active even in their dismembered state. As such, we can begin to analyse them as embodying a categorically different kind of agency - post-mortem or secondary agency - while remaining cautious of overzealous attempts to claim that everyone and everything has agency of equivalence. Definitions of agency are examined and its definition within this article is explicitly formulated, drawing especially on ideas from Gell (1998), Robb (2004), Sewell (2005) and Latour (2005). Through a case study from the Peruvian Andes in which approximately 240 individuals were dismembered, I suggest that the primary agency once embodied in those living persons was transformed into secondary agency (Gell 1998) as the person-cum-corpse was remade into smaller body parts. These body parts and their placement in a ritually significant locale, had profound effects on the living, particularly as it related to the ways that those dead-body objects extended social relations and social hierarchies, making them more durable. © 2014 The McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928006550

It is not related to rites of passage, but to different social status in a group. Therefore, the deformed cranium is an expression of individual affirmation and affiliation to a given social group. Osteological material from Pasamayo (AD 1200-1450), a cemetery in central coast of Peru, was analyzed to test whether individuals presenting different types of cranial deformation (interpreted as a sign of different social status) present differences in health status. Three types of cranial deformation were observed and five osteological markers (cribra orbitalia, cranial trauma, antemortem tooth loss, dental caries, and periodontal cavities) related to health status were analyzed in 78 crania. No significant differences were found in terms of these osteological markers among females in relation to the different types of cranial deformation. However, males presenting occipital deformation had significantly less caries and periodontal cavities than the others. Moreover, males presenting fronto-lambdoid deformation had more antemortem tooth loss than the other males. Therefore, although different types of cranial deformation can be potentially associated to distinct social status, differences in health status could only be observed in the male sample.","Archaeology; Bioanthropology; Palaeopathology; Pasamayo",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902185877
