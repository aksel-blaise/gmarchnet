Morphometric studies most often use the arrangements of morphological landmarks as the data source and extract shape information from them by Procrustes superimposition. The MorphoJ software combines this approach with a wide range of methods for shape analysis in different biological contexts. The program offers an integrated and user-friendly environment for standard multivariate analyses such as principal components, discriminant analysis and multivariate regression as well as specialized applications including phylogenetics, quantitative genetics and analyses of modularity in shape data.

It is unique as a multivariate method in its choice of emphasis for analysis, that being the covariance between brain images and exogenous blocks representing either the experiment design or some behavioral measure. What emerges are spatial patterns of brain activity that represent the optimal association between the images and either of the blocks. This process differs substantially from other multivariate methods in that rather than attempting to predict the individual values of the image pixels, PLS attempts to explain the relation between image pixels and task or behavior. Data from a face encoding and recognition PET rCBF study are used to illustrate two types of PLS analysis: an activation analysis of task with images and a brain-behavior analysis. The commonalities across the two analyses are suggestive of a general face memory network differentially engaged during encoding and recognition. PLS thus serves as an important extension by extracting new information from imaging data that is not accessible through other currently used univariate and multivariate image analysis tools.",,"brain blood flow; brain function; image analysis; imaging; mathematical analysis; positron emission tomography; priority journal; review",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029941179

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

Previous studies have documented greater right-biases in upper limb bone dimensions - especially in length and diaphyseal breadth - as well as more asymmetry in the upper limb when compared with the lower limb. Some studies have reported left-bias in lower limb bone dimensions, which, combined with the contralateral asymmetry in upper limbs, has been termed ""crossed symmetry."" The examination of sexual dimorphism and population variation in asymmetry has been limited. This study re-examines these topics in a large, geographically and temporally diverse sample of 780 Holocene adult humans. Fourteen bilateral measures were taken, including maximum lengths, articular and peri-articular breadths, and diaphyseal breadths of the femur, tibia, humerus, and radius. Dimensions were converted into percentage directional (%DA) and absolute (%AA) asymmetries. Results reveal that average diaphyseal breadths in both the upper and lower limbs have the greatest absolute and directional asymmetry among all populations, with lower asymmetry evident in maximum lengths or articular dimensions. Upper limb bones demonstrate a systematic right-bias in all dimensions, while lower limb elements have biases closer to zero %DA, but with slight left-bias in diaphyseal breadths and femoral length. Crossed symmetry exists within individuals between similar dimensions of the upper and lower limbs. Females have more asymmetric and right-biased upper limb maximum lengths, while males have greater humeral diaphyseal and head breadth %DAs. The lower limb demonstrates little sexual dimorphism in asymmetry. Industrial groups exhibit relatively less asymmetry than pre-industrial humans and less dimorphism in asymmetry. A mixture of influences from both genetic and behavioral factors is implicated as the source of these patterns. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite this, limited knowledge of normal or pathologic glenohumeral joint articular mechanics and contact is available. This study uses a stereophotogrammetry technique to determine contact areas in normal cadaver glenohumeral joints with intact ligaments and capsule through a large range of motion using simulated forces of the four rotator cuff muscles and three deltoid heads. All shoulders were first elevated to their maximum elevation in the scapular plane at an external rotation (starting rotation = 40 ± 8°), which allowed each shoulder to attain its maximal elevation in the scapular plane, and then repeated at 20° internal to this rotation. Contact areas consistently increased with increasing elevation until 120° to an average of 5.07 cm2 before decreasing with further increased elevation to an average of 2.59 cm2 at 180° of total arm elevation. At 20° internal to the starting rotation, contact areas reached high values 60° earlier (averaged 4.56 cm2 at 60° of total arm elevation) and then remained fairly constant through 120° before decreasing with further increased elevation to 2.51 cm2 at 180° total arm elevation. With increasing elevation in the external starting rotation, humeral head contact dramatically migrates from an inferior region to a superocentral‐posterior region while glenoid contact shifts posteriorly. When the humeral shaft is positioned 20° internal to the starting rotation, humeral head contact shifts from inferocentral‐anterior to superocentral‐posterior regions. Simultaneously, a similar posterior shift in glenoid contact is observed. Furthermore, whereas only a small portion of the humeral head surface area is in contact in any given position, contact on the glenoid surface is much more uniformly distributed over its entire articulating surface.

Both bones showed significant bilateral asymmetry in size and shape, although the pattern of asymmetry varied by sex and age group. Males were more asymmetric in humeral dimensions (right side larger), females in tibial dimensions (left side larger). Bilateral asymmetry in both tibiae and humeri decreased with age, primarily due to greater losses of cortical bone from the sides with more bone in early adulthood (left tibiae in females, right humeri in both sexes). Intercorrelations between humeral and tibial bone areas showed the male right humerus to be less highly correlated with other areas of the skeleton than any other bone compared.

Still University, Mesa, AZ, United States","Overhead athletes require a delicate balance of shoulder mobility and stability in order to meet the functional demands of their respective sport. Altered shoulder mobility has been reported in overhead athletes and is thought to develop secondary to adaptive structural changes to the joint resulting from the extreme physiological demands of overhead activity. Researchers have speculated as to whether these structural adaptations compromise shoulder stability, thus exposing the overhead athlete to shoulder injury. Debate continues as to whether these altered mobility patterns arise from soft-tissue or osseous adaptations within and around the shoulder. Researchers have used quantitative techniques in an attempt to better characterize these structural adaptations in the shoulders of overhead athletes. Throwing athletes have been shown to display altered rotational range of motion (ROM) patterns in the dominant shoulder that favour increased external rotation and limited internal rotation ROM. Throwers also show a loss of horizontal or cross-body adduction in the throwing shoulder when compared with the non-throwing shoulder. This posterior shoulder immobility in the throwing shoulder is thought by some researchers to be associated with reactive scarring or contracture of the periscapular soft-tissue structures (e.g. posterior capsule and/or cuff musculature); however, evidence of reactive scarring or contractures of the posterior-inferior capsule or cuff musculature from anatomic or noninvasive imaging studies is lacking. Conversely, translational ROM (laxity) has been consistently shown to be symmetric between dominant and non-dominant shoulders of overhead athletes. From a skeletal perspective, throwing shoulders are shown to have more humeral retroversion when compared with the non-throwing shoulder. Alterations in humeral retroversion are thought to develop over time in young pre-adolescent throwers when the proximal humeral epiphysis is not yet completely fused. Even though the evidence is inconclusive at the present time, there is more compelling evidence that leads us to believe that altered shoulder mobility in the overhead-throwing athlete is more strongly associated with adaptive changes in proximal humeral anatomy (i.e. retroversion) than to structural changes in the articular and periarticular soft tissue structures. In addition, this retroversion is thought to account for the observed shift in the arc of rotational ROM in overhead athletes. However, in some athletes, capsulo-ligamentous adaptations such as anterior-inferior stretching or posterior-inferior contracture may become superimposed upon the osseous changes. This may ultimately lead to pathological manifestations such as secondary impingement, type II superior labrum from anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions and/or internal (glenoid) impingement. Overuse injuries in the overhead athlete are a common and perplexing clinical problem in sports medicine and, therefore, it is imperative for sports medicine clinicians to have a thorough understanding of the short- and long-term effects of overhead activity on the shoulder complex. It is our intention that the information presented will serve as a guide for clinicians who treat the shoulders of overhead athletes. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

The study sample consisted of 139 crania of known sex (73 males and 66 females) belonging to persons who lived during the first half of the 20th century in Bohemia. The three-dimensional co-ordinates of 82 ecto-cranial landmarks and 39 semi-landmarks covering the midsagittal curve of the cranial vault were digitised using a MicroScribe G2X contact digitiser. The purposes of the investigation were to define the regions of the cranium where sexual dimorphism is most pronounced and to investigate the effectiveness of this method for determining sex from the shape of the cranium. The results demonstrate that it is better to analyse apportionable parts of the cranium rather than the cranium as a whole. Significant sexual differences (significance was determined using multivariate analysis of variance) were noted in the shape of the midsagittal curve of the vault, upper face, the region of the nose, orbits, and palate. No differences were recorded either in the shape of the cranium as a whole or in the regions of the base and the neurocranium. The greatest accuracy in determining sex was found in the region of the upper face (100% of study subjects correctly classified) and the midsagittal curve of the vault (99% of study subjects correctly classified). © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

Although the model is improved, the realistic animation of the shoulder is hardly achieved. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to coordinate the simultaneous motion of the shoulder components in a consistent way.

The main aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of enthesopathies among individuals living in different life conditions. A total of 197 individuals from the Early Medieval (9th century) Mikulčice site were analysed for enthesopathies - 117 adult individuals from Mikulčice castle and 80 individuals from its hinterland. While the inhabitants of the castle were probably ranked among the higher echelons of society, the hinterland was predominantly inhabited by a farming population. It is hypothesized that individuals from the castle were exposed to lower physical stress than individuals from the hinterland. 9 fibrocartilaginous entheses of the upper and lower limbs were evaluated. Enthesopathies occurred in at least one enthesis in 76% of individuals younger than 50 years of age. Significant differences were observed in the occurrence of enthesopathies between castle and hinterland. Males from the agricultural hinterland show the highest prevalence of enthesopathies of all the population groups, while the lowest prevalence of the marker was recorded in males from the castle. Females in the castle were more affected by entheseal changes than females from the hinterland. Sexual dimorphism was more evident in the hinterland. The present study confirmed presumptions based on the archaeological finds, especially for males. This hypothesis cannot be accepted for females. We may suppose that in the 9th century, women living in Mikulčice castle did not represent a privileged social class. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Early Middle Ages; Enthesopathies; Great Moravia; MSM; Occupational stress markers; Sexual division of labour",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960739969

Physiologically, the clavicle is an integrated element of the upper limb, transmitting loads to the axial skeleton and supporting the distal bones. However, clavicles develop in a manner that is unique among the bones of the upper limb. Previous studies have indicated that the clavicle has a right-biased asymmetry in diaphyseal breadth, as in humeri, radii, ulnae, and metacarpals, but unlike these other elements, a left-biased length asymmetry. Few studies have assessed how clavicular asymmetry relates to these other bones of the upper limb. Bilateral directional asymmetry of the clavicle is examined in relation to the humerus in a large, geographically diverse human sample, comparing lengths and diaphyseal breadths. Dimensions were converted into percentage directional (%DA) and absolute (%AA) asymmetries. Results indicate that humans have same-side %DA bias in the clavicles and humeri, and contralateral length %DA between these elements. Diaphyseal breadths in both clavicles and humeri are more asymmetric-both in direction and amount-than lengths. Differences in diaphyseal asymmetry are shown to relate to variation in physical activities among groups, but a relationship between activity and length asymmetry is not supported. This further supports previous research, which suggests different degrees of sensitivity to loading between diaphyseal breadths and maximum lengths of long bones. Differences in lateralized behavior and the potential effects of different bone development are examined as possible influences on the patterns observed among human groups. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A range of possible explanations can be advanced to account for this asymmetry. In the present work, clavicular morphology was studied in a medieval skeletal assemblage from Wharram Percy, England, with the aim of evaluating these competing explanations. At Wharram Percy, as anticipated the right clavicle tended to be shorter. Patterns of asymmetry in curvature, robusticity, vascularization, and in the morphology of ligament and muscle attachment sites were also studied. The patterning in these date at Wharram Percy is consistent with inhibition of longitudinal growth of the clavicle on the dominant side due to lateral bias in mechanical loading, particularly in axial compression.

But many questions remain. How much stronger, for example, were Neanderthals than living humans? And what does this difference in strength tell us about the behavior of our ancestors? Recent research has shown that some of our earlier assumptions about robusticity and behavior in earlier humans are either simplistic or untrue. For example, it is now clear that although earlier humans were, on the average, stronger than living peoples, this is not invariably the case. Some modern human groups have even stronger humeri than those of Neanderthals. The fact that changes in robusticity do not always neatly coincide with subsistence or technological change suggests that interpretations derived in large measure from stone‐tool technology and other artifactual evidence may be misleading. This new information on physical strength in earlier humans necessitates a reassessment of traditional ideas about earlier human behavior.

However, the archeological record itself does not entirely support this model. Alternatively, this transition may be interpreted as a continuous process. We used asymmetry in external dimensions, and asymmetry in size and distribution of cortical tissue of humeri to elucidate the nature of this transition with respect to differences in manipulative behavior. The total sample of 67 individuals representing five archaeological cultures was used. The results indicate that the pattern of asymmetry of the humeral external measurements and the cross-sectional parameters taken at 35% of humeral biomechanical length remain stable during the Late Eneolithic and Early Bronze Age. However, females of both periods show fluctuating asymmetry for all of the cross-sectional parameters, but directional asymmetry for biomechanical length. Males are nonsignificantly shifted from the line of equivalence for biomechanical length, but exhibit directional asymmetry for the cortical area and polar moment of area. Only distal articular breadth yields fluctuating asymmetry for both females and males in both periods. Thus, the transition from the Late Eneolithic to the Early Bronze Age can be seen as a continuous process that probably affected only a limited part of human activities. We interpret the differences between females and males of both periods as evidence of gender-specific activities; males might have been associated with extra-domestic agricultural labor that resulted in asymmetrical manipulative loading and females with domestic labor with symmetrical manipulative loading in both periods. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Bronze Age; Cross-sectional geometry; Eneolithic; Handedness; Humerus","archeology; article; biomechanics; cortical bone; cultural anthropology; Europe; female; geological time; handedness; human; human tissue; humerus; machiavellianism; male; physical anthropology; sex difference; Behavior; Europe; Female; Humans; Humerus; Male; Sex Characteristics; Stress, Mechanical; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247617374

Analysis of asymmetry may also assess preferential use of the right or left of the body during specific activities. This study is based on the measurements of bones of the upper and lower limbs of skeletons derived from the remarkable medieval cemeteries of Mikulčice-Kostelisko (78 male, 132 female) and Prušánky (66 male, 69 female) (9th-12th centuries AD), and a series of skeletons representing a recent population from Bohemia (143 male, 157 female). The objective was to assess directional asymmetry (DA), fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and antisymmetry (AS) of the dimensions of the evaluated bones, and to use these data to compare the characteristics of the medieval and recent populations. DA was recorded in most dimensions. In the upper limb, the humerus exhibited the greatest expression of asymmetry, and, with the exception of the clavicle, DA was always more pronounced on the right side. Conversely, DA was less prevalent in the lower limb bones. It was more pronounced on the transverse, sagittal and circumferential dimensions of the diaphyses and epiphyses than on the length, and in most cases it was on the left side. The FA values were very low, and almost negligible in relation to the size. Nevertheless, FA was markedly more frequent on the lower than on the upper limb. In contrast to the medieval population, the recent population had higher FA and DA values. Thus, we propose that people from this medieval population were subjected to lower developmental stress than the recent sample.

The aim of this research is to assess the plasticity of limb articular dimension through the use of directional asymmetry as an indicator of mechanical stress during skeletal development. Directional asymmetry is largely attributable to differential mechanical loading during bone growth related to handedness. Because the large majority of individuals are right-handed, it is hypothesized that joint dimensions will be significantly larger in the upper right limb and lower left limb in the crossed symmetry pattern that is typically exhibited in bone lengths. Patterns of bilateral variation were explored by sex and skeletal location. Significant levels of directional asymmetry (P < 0.05) suggest that limb articular surfaces are adapted to the mechanical environment. Biomechanical factors are important in the development and maintenance of articular morphology.

The M/EI trades involve installing piping; heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), and electrical systems in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. In the absence of an ergonomics standard in the United States, some building and construction contractors, including M/EI sector contractors, have implemented various ergonomics interventions on their worksites on a voluntary basis. However, no data were available to determine the type of voluntary control measures being implemented, the task-specific hazards for which control measures needed to be developed or refined, and perceived barriers to improving hazard control. As part of a larger effort to obtain this data, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) organized a stakeholder meeting to gather information regarding ergonomics interventions or 'best practices' by M/EI contractors and tradespeople. The attendees included 39 industry representatives, 17 construction ergonomics researchers from government and academia, and four ergonomics consultants with experience in the construction industry. Participants spent more than 50% of time meeting in small trade-specific breakout sessions. According to the participants, tasks common to the three trades included (1) drill holes and shoot fasteners; (2) place and install systems, and (3) lift and carry materials and equipment. Engineering interventions described in the stakeholder meeting included tools, equipment, and engineered building materials; administrative controls largely consisted of training and education programs and modifications of work and management practice.

Results confirmed that males of the California Amerind population who engaged in the more unimanual activities of spear hunting and warfare were more asymmetrical than were their female counterparts who engaged in the more bimanual activities of grinding acorns. California Amerind males were also more asymmetrical than British Columbian Amerind males who rowed (using both arms) extensively. Sex differences within British Columbian Amerinds were not statistically significant, nor were female differences between populations. In general, levels of humeral asymmetry appear to be more dependent on sex and population-specific behaviors rather than broad subsistence patterns. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Cross-sections; Humeral asymmetry; Sex differences","adult; aged; American Indian; animal hunting; article; bone structure; Canada; controlled study; cultural anthropology; daily life activity; ethnic difference; female; grinding; human; human tissue; humerus; male; prehistoric period; sex difference; social structure; United States; war; Adaptation, Physiological; Adolescent; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Body Size; British Columbia; California; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; History, Ancient; Human Activities; Humans; Humerus; Indians, North American; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Stress, Mechanical",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949092103

The results were that the bilateral asymmetries of humeral length and all other measurements except for proximal epiphyseal breadth did not correlate significantly with asymmetries of diaphyseal geometric properties. Since the longitudinal growth of a long bone stops when its epiphyses are fused with the metaphyses while corticla remodelling goes on for life, the present results can be interpreted as follows: 1) Bilateral asymmetries in the longitudinal direction is likely to reflect the cumulative loading conditions to around an age of 20 years, and 2) bilateral asymmetries in the tranverse direction reflects loading conditions relatively close to the time of death. Regarding the loading conditions inferred for the upper arms of Jomon people, it is suggested that they were stronger than in modern Japanese and some hunter-gatherers (Amerindians). The loading conditions of the upper arms of Jomon people were also likely to be less asymmetric than in other populations, while differing considerably between sexes.","Bilateral asymmetry; Cross-sectional geometric properties; Humerus; Linear measurements",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031240168

A sample of 505 individuals (285 males, 220 females) from the William McCormick Clavicle Collection was CT scanned, segmented, and added to a statistical bone atlas that captures correspondence between homologous points on the bone surfaces. Muscle attachment sites were localized on the atlas and then propagated across the entire population. Cross-sectional contours were extracted at 5% increments along the entire bone, as well as at muscle attachment sites and the clavicle waist; maximum and minimum dimensions of each cross-sectional contour were calculated. In addition, the entire three-dimensional surface was examined for asymmetry by analyzing the magnitude and directional differences between homologous points across all bone surfaces in the dataset. The results confirm the existing studies on clavicle asymmetry, namely that the left clavicle is longer than the right, but the right is more robust than the left. However, the patterns of asymmetry are sexually dimorphic. Males are significantly asymmetric in all dimensions and at muscle and ligament attachment sites (P < 0.05), whereas female asymmetry is more variable. We hypothesize that this is related to absolute and relative differences in male muscle strength compared to females. However, an area with no muscle attachments on the posterior midshaft was significantly asymmetric in both sexes. We suggest that this is a curvature difference caused by opposing muscle actions at the medial and lateral ends of the bone. Am J Phys Anthropol 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

From the mid-1960s (Szalay, 1968) to at least the mid-1980s (Szalay et al., 1987), he was acknowledged as the leading researcher on non-anthropoid fossil primates, complementing the anthropoid expertise of Elwyn Simons who had just laid the foundations for paleoprimatology as a distinct field through his revisions and field success in the Fayum of Egypt. Fred edited two volumes in this area in 1975, in both of which Delson (as a very junior colleague) was most pleased to be included (Szalay, 1975; Luckett and Szalay, 1975), which in turn led to their collaborative review of the whole order (Szalay and Delson, 1979). Fred was also an early critic of the cladistic approach to phylogenetic reconstruction, passionately opposed to the narrowness of evolutionary thinking that he felt stemmed from cladistic thinking, so he developed (often with Walter Bock) a refinement of the “evolutionary” taxonomic approach (e.g., Szalay, 1977b, 1993; Szalay and Bock, 1991). Although his earliest work focused on crania and dentitions, Fred was equally interested in postcranial morphology from both functional and phylogenetic viewpoints (Decker and Szalay, 1974; Szalay and Decker, 1974; Szalay et al., 1975); he almost single-handedly made morphology of the postcranium relevant to mammalian phytogeny reconstruction, and he argued that the distinction between functionalism and non-functional thinking was entirely artificial. His long 1977(a) paper on mammalian phytogeny was almost entirely based on the evidence from foot bones, and this focus continued in his work on primates (Szalay and Dagosto, 1980, 1988; Szalay and Langdon, 1986) as well as eutherian and especially metatherian mammals (Szalay and Drawhorn, 1980; Szalay, 1984, 1994; Szalay and Lucas, 1993, 1996; Szalay and Sargis, 2001). Fred argued that taxa could just as readily be distinguished by their postcrania as by their teeth, ear regions or facial structure. Many of his colleagues rejected this idea or thought that (at best), postcranial morphology might delineate families or subfamilies, but not genera or species. Fred’s most recent contribution (Szalay, 2007; in a book whose co-editor is the same as this volume’s) reviewed the locomotor adaptations of the earliest primates and their predecessors, comparing several entrenched hypotheses unfavorably to his own prior interpretations. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.","Centroid size; Joint congruence; Joint surface; Procrustes distance; Trochlear groove",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045110793

The assumption is that good symmetry exists between both glenoid surfaces with regard to size and shape. The purpose of this study is to critically analyze the structural symmetry of both glenoids in an objective and quantitative manner to ascertain the degree of symmetry present. Materials and methods: The study cohort comprised 60 subjects (35 males and 25 females) with no shoulder pathology or injury. Each glenoid surface was extracted from the whole scapular model constructed from CT data using a 3D curvature-based incremental watershed algorithm. Glenoid morphometric analysis was carried out based on the 2D contour of the glenoid projected on the principal plane. Results: There was no side-to-side difference in glenoid length (p = 0.53), width (p = 0.42), area (p = 0.36), or circumference (p = 0.73). All glenoid dimensions were larger in males than females (p &lt; 0.05). Point-wise curvature analysis showed no significant shape difference between both glenoids (all p &gt; 0.1). Regression analysis revealed a positive correlation (R 2 = 0.3-0.5) between increasing age and increasing glenoid size. Conclusions: In normal subjects, both glenoids are highly symmetric in shape and size. This study provides objective and quantitative justification for using the normal counterlateral glenoid as a reference standard for initial glenoid shape in patients with unilateral glenoid bone loss. © 2013 ISS.","Computed tomography; Glenoid; Morphological analysis; Shoulder dislocation; Watershed algorithm","adult; age; aged; article; bone symmetry; cohort analysis; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; correlation analysis; female; glenoid bone; human; image reconstruction; male; measurement; morphometrics; musculoskeletal system parameters; normal human; principal component analysis; priority journal; sex difference; shoulder; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anthropometry; China; Female; Glenoid Cavity; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886775811

Among hominoids, juvenile African apes are known to climb more frequently than adults, while orangutans and gibbons maintain an arboreal lifestyle throughout ontogeny. This study examined if these ontogenetic locomotor differences carry a morphological signal, which should be evident in the scapulae of chimpanzees and gorillas but absent in taxa that do not display ontogenetic behavioral shifts. The scapular morphology of five hominoid primates and one catarrhine outgroup was examined throughout ontogeny to evaluate if scapular traits linked with arboreal activities are modified in response to ontogenetic behavioral shifts away from climbing. Specifically, the following questions were addressed: 1) which scapular characteristics distinguish taxa with different locomotor habits; and 2) do these traits show associated changes during development in taxa known to modify their behavioral patterns? Several traits characterized suspensory taxa from nonsuspensory forms, such as cranially oriented glenohumeral joints, obliquely oriented scapular spines, relatively narrow infraspinous fossae, and inferolaterally expanded subscapularis fossae. The relative shape of the dorsal scapular fossae changed in Pan, Gorilla, and also Macaca in line with predictions based on reported ontogenetic changes in locomotor behavior. These morphological changes were mostly distinct from those seen in Pongo, Hylobates, and Homo and imply a unique developmental pattern, possibly related to ontogenetic locomotor shifts. Accordingly, features that sorted taxa by locomotor habits and changed in concert with ontogenetic behavioral patterns should be particularly useful for reconstructing the locomotor habits of fossil forms.

We tested the robustness of GSN sex classification on the basis of geometric morphometrics (GM) and support vector machines (SVM), using two different population samples. Using photographs, the shape of the GSN in 229 samples from two assemblages (documented collections of a Euroamerican population from the Maxwell Museum, University of New Mexico, and a Hispanic population from Universidad Nacional Autõnoma de México, Mexico City) was segmented automatically and evaluated using six curve representations. The optimal dimensionality for each representation was determined by finding the best sex classification. The classification accuracy of the six curve representations in our study was similar but the highest and concurrently homologous cross-validated accuracy of 92% was achieved for a pooled sample using Fourier coefficient and Legendre polynomial methods. The success rate of our classification was influenced by the number of semilandmarks or coefficients and was only slightly affected by GSN marginal point positions. The intrapopulation variability of the female GSN shape was significantly lower compared with the male variability, possibly as a consequence of the intense selection pressure associated with reproduction. Males were misclassified more often than females. Our results show that by using a suitable GSN curve representation, a GM approach, and SVM analysis, it is possible to obtain a robust separation between the sexes that is stable for a multipopulation sample.

FEA is used to test mechanical hypotheses in functional anatomy and VA complements and augments this process by virtue of its tools for acquiring data, for segmenting and preparing virtual specimens, and for generating reconstructions and artificial forms. This represents a critical methodological advance because geometry is one of the crucial inputs of FEA and is often the variable of interest in functional anatomy. However, we currently lack tools that quantitatively relate differences in geometry to differences in stress and strain, or that evaluate the impact on FEA of variation within and between biological samples. Thus, when comparing models of different geometry, we do not currently obtain sufficiently informative answers to questions such as ""How different are these models, and in what manner are they different? Are they different in some anatomical regions but not others?""

Sexual dimorphism during the last 1200 years was evaluated using geometric morphometric analysis of virtual cranial models. The method of geometric morphometrics allows differences in size and shape to be assessed separately. We analyzed groups of adult individuals dating to Early Middle Ages, High Middle Ages, Early Modern Ages and from a modern Czech population (21st century). Significant sexual dimorphism in mandibular size was found in all populations. A trend in the sexual dimorphism of size was seen, with differences between the sexes increasing gradually over time. Size changes in female mandibles were a better reflection of environmental conditions and climate than size changes in male mandibles. Regarding changes in the sexual dimorphism of shape, significant dimorphism was found in all four samples. However, the pattern of mandibular shape dimorphism was different and varied considerably between samples. There was only one stable shape trait showing sexual dimorphism across all four samples in our study: the gonion lies more laterally in male than in female mandibles and male mandibles are relatively wider than female mandibles. Sexual dimorphism of shape is not influenced by the climate; instead sexual selection might play a role. This research supports earlier studies that have found that the degree and pattern of sexual dimorphism is population-specific and the factors regulating sexual dimorphism today may not be the same as those in the past. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.",,"adult; article; climate; comparative study; diet; environment; Europe; female; fossil; histology; history; human; male; mandible; middle aged; sex difference; Adult; Climate; Diet; Environment; Europe; Female; Fossils; History, 15th Century; History, 16th Century; History, 17th Century; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; History, Medieval; Humans; Male; Mandible; Middle Aged; Sex Factors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887819197

Archaeological and historical data indicate that the diet of children was based on foods poor in vitamin C and contained small amounts of raw plant products. Also, historians emphasise that in medieval and post-medieval Poland, there were seasonal fluctuations in food availability, frequently accompanied by poor harvests. Both resulted in long periods of poor nutrition, which affected children most severely. The aim of this study was to investigate skeletal manifestations of scurvy in subadult remains from medieval and post-medieval Poland. Following standards described by Ortner and colleagues, anatomical sites pathognomonic of scurvy in subadults (<17 years) were assessed for abnormal porosity and hypertrophic bone among skeletons excavated from three sites: Ostrów Lednicki (dated to the 11th–14th centuries AD), Cedynia (10th–14th centuries AD) and Słaboszewo (14th–17th centuries AD). In total, 3.6% of all examined children were found to bear traces of vitamin C deficiency. The prevalence of scorbutic lesions was 4.5% for Cedynia, 2.6% for Ostrów Lednicki and 3.6% for Słaboszewo. The majority of affected children were less than 7 years of age. Scurvy was likely more widespread in the living populations than it appears from the calculation of skeletal markers, because some individuals might have recovered or died before obvious traces became apparent. Also, in some children, scurvy might not have reached an advanced stage, identifiable in the skeletal material. The prevalence of scurvy reflects not only dietary patterns but also food storage and preparation techniques adopted in the Polish territories during the Middle Ages, which contributed to low intakes of vitamin C.

The analysis of skeletal remains and parish records from the region documented the biological status of inhabitants and its changes over a millennium, The study material comprised 424 human skeletons from an Early Medieval burial ground on Lake Lednica, records of 2,704 deaths from the registers of the Roman Catholic parish of Dziekanowice, made between 1818-1903, data on the deaths of 929,192 inhabitants of rural areas all over the province Wielkopolska obtained from Prussian statistical materials for the years 1865-1900, and comparative data from the literature. Assuming both a stationary population model and a stable population model with nonzero natural increase, parameters of life tables and measures of opportunity for natural selection (Crow's index Im, potential gross reproductive rate Rpot, and the biological state index Ibs) were calculated for the Early Middle Ages and for the two periods of the 19th century which were characterized by different laws of land ownership and thus different rural economies. In the first period, peasants were tenants, whereas in the second, they were given freehold of the land they cultivated. Causes of death were also analyzed. A distinct increase in longevity from the early Middle Ages to the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century was found. This was related to a higher level of demographic development in the parish of Dziekanowice during the 19th century, which was achieved earlier than in other areas of Poland. This was confirmed by genetic measures: coefficients of exogamy and coefficients of kinship. The reasons were related to the historical prominence of this region and to its proximity to the first two capitals of the Polish state, Gniezno and Poznań. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Coefficients of kinship; Exogamy; Life tables; Opportunity for natural selection","article; cause of death; controlled study; demography; history; human; life expectancy; life table; longevity; natural selection; Poland; population dynamics; population model; population research; rural population; skeleton; social status; Age Factors; Bone and Bones; Demography; Genetics, Population; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, Medieval; Humans; Life Expectancy; Life Tables; Mortality; Poland; Rural Population; Selection (Genetics); Sex Factors; Social Change",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-8844238315

Scapular motion relative to the thorax has a theoretical maximum of 6 degrees of freedom (DoF), resulting from rotations at both clavicular joints (3 rotational DoF each). However, most recent kinematic studies have only analysed the 3D rotations of the scapula relative to the thorax. In the present study, the 3D translations of the barycentre of the scapula were considered in order to complete the description of movement at the shoulder complex. Eight healthy subjects performed arm elevation in the sagittal and frontal planes, simulated activities of daily living (hair combing and back washing) and maximum voluntary scapula movement (forward and backward rolling). Measurements were recorded using a 6 DoF electromagnetic device and the acromial method of analysis was used. The results showed that 3D scapular rotations and translation of its barycentre were functionally consistent for all tasks. A principal component analysis (PCA) yielded three factors, explaining 97.6% of the variance. The first two factors (protraction and shrug, according to clinical descriptions) combined rotations and translations, consistent with the hypothesis that the scapula rolls over the curved thoracic surface. The third factor related to lateral-medial rotation, thus representing rotation in the plane tangential to the thorax. The PCA suggested that scapular motion can be described using these 3 DoF. This should be studied in a larger group of individuals, including patients with pathological conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Clavicle; Kinematics; Protraction; Scapula rotation","adult; arm movement; Article; biomechanics; daily life activity; electron spin resonance; human; human experiment; hypothesis; kinematics; middle aged; movement (physiology); normal human; principal component analysis; scapula; scapulothoracic motion; simulation; task performance; thorax; three dimensional imaging; volunteer; young adult; arm; clavicle; female; joint characteristics and functions; male; movement (physiology); physiology; rotation; Adult; Arm; Biomechanical Phenomena; Clavicle; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Principal Component Analysis; Range of Motion, Articular; Rotation; Scapula",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920274736

Here, we demonstrate a novel application of GM to the analysis of whole postcranial elements in a study of 77 hominoid tibiae. We focus on two novel methodological improvements to standard GM approaches: 1) landmark configurations of tibiae including 15 epiphyseal landmarks and 483 semilandmarks along articular surfaces and muscle insertions along the tibial shaft and 2) an artificial affine transformation that sets moments along the shaft equal to the sum of the moments estimated in the other two anatomical directions. Diagrams of the principal components of tibial shapes support most differences between human and non-human primates reported previously. The artificial affine transformation proposed here results in an improved clustering of the great apes that may prove useful in future discriminant or clustering studies. Since the shape variations observed may be related to different locomotor behaviors, posture, or activity patterns, we suggest that this method be used in functional analyses of tibiae or other long bones in modern populations or fossil specimens.

Methods FEA was used to analyze the biomechanical performance of different hominoid scapulae by simulating static postural scenarios. GM was used to quantify scapular shape differences and the relationship between form and function was analyzed by applying both multivariate-multiple regressions and phylogenetic generalized least-squares regressions (PGLS). Results Although it has been suggested that primate scapular morphology is mainly a product of function rather than phylogeny, our results showed that shape has a significant phylogenetic signal. There was a significant relationship between scapular shape and its biomechanical performance; hence at least part of the scapular shape variation is due to non-phylogenetic factors, probably related to functional demands.

The influence of genes, the size of ulnar processes, joint laxity, and bone robusticity, have been discussed; however, the problem has not yet been solved. The main aim of this study was to examine the influence of ulnar and humeri shape on septal aperture formation, using geometric morphometric analyses. Skeletal material from an early-mediaeval cemetery located in Western Poland was used. The material comprised two groups: (1) ulnae and humeri with septal apertures, (2) ulnae and humeri without septal apertures. From a CT image, three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained for all bones. Then, 25 landmarks were distributed on each proximal end of the ulnae and 30 landmarks on the distal ends of the humeri. Shape differences between ulnae in joints with and without SA were significant for the left and right sides of the body. The shapes of the left and right distal ends of humeri with SA differed significantly from those without SA. Similar results were obtained for the right side of the body. Ulnae from joints with SA were characterized by a more pronounced olecranon process, a smaller articulated coronoid process and a more tightly curved trochlear notch than ulnae from joints without SA. Humeri with SA included wider and deeper olecranon fossae and smaller and less curved articular surfaces. These results partly coincide with the results of other research indicating the influence of olecranon processes on lamina perforation. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Elbow joint; Humeroulnar joint; Intercondylar foramen; Nonmetrical features; Supratrochlear foramen","adult; anatomical variation; Article; elbow; epiphysis; geometric morphometrics; human; humerus; morphological trait; morphometrics; olecranon; posthumous care; priority journal; septal aperture; skeleton; three dimensional imaging; ulna; anatomy and histology; female; male; procedures; Female; Humans; Humerus; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Ulna",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946944325

Whereas previous work has generally focused on clavicular length and torsion, the shape of clavicular curvature may better distinguish taxa and provide additional information about upper limb use in locomotion. This study uses three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze shape differences in the curvatures of the clavicle in different locomotor groups of anthropoid primates. Methods: Sliding semi-landmarks were placed on clavicles of 10 Anthropoid primate species (total n-=-85) that display a range of locomotor behaviors. Landmarks (k-=-39) were chosen to capture the overall curvature of the clavicle in three dimensions. Results: The degree of ventral curvature in the clavicle represents a gradient from most-curved in suspensory genera (e.g., Ateles, Hylobates, and Pongo) to least-curved in genera that are rarely suspensory (e.g., Papio and Gorilla). This curvature may allow an increased range of craniodorsal movement without the clavicle impinging on the thoracic outlet. An inferior curvature of the medial clavicle is found in hominoids and brachiators. This curvature could help stabilize the shoulder and prevent superior dislocation of the clavicle in suspension. Finally, a superior curvature in the lateral part of the clavicle, most pronounced in quadrupedal monkeys, may be related to the relative position of the scapula and sternum. Conclusions: Patterns of clavicular curvature in anthropoid primates reflect locomotor behavior and successfully distinguished among taxonomic and locomotor groups. In the future, this method could be used to assess locomotor behavior in fossil primates. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","clavicle; primate locomotion; shoulder morphology","anatomical variation; Article; body mass; bone structure; clavicle; geometry; Hylobates; locomotion; nonhuman; orangutan; scapula; simian; spider monkey; sternum; structure analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941418652

Analyses based on these atlases indicated that curvature and shape of the internal humeral canal were similar in males and females while humeral length and width were greater in males. Most importantly, surface curvatures were explicitly different between clusters.Conclusion: Morphologic analysis based on statistical atlases is novel and useful to characterize the Asian humerus. The humerus demonstrates gender-specific morphology. This unique approach provides information that is useful to the clinician and biomedical engineer, not only in the modification of current or design of future humeral implants, but also in the precise dynamic positioning of Asian-specific humeral implants to Asian patients. Our findings support the need for further development of humeral implants, curvilinear robotics, and the questioning of whether gender-specific devices are necessary.Purpose: Positioning existing humeral implants into Asian patients poses significant challenges due to the inconsistent statistical shapes between Western population and Asian population. Current humeral orthopedic fixation devices and implants have a generic shape and are not designed for Asian patients who exhibit different sizes and shapes compared to their Western counterparts for which present day designs have been based on. To address this problem, it is necessary to develop Asian-specific implants that accommodate the morphology of Asian humeri. Existing morphological studies of humeri in Asian populations are rare and most previous analyses are either based on the manual measurement of dry bones or the use of dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scans. The purpose of this pilot morphological study is to explore the characteristics of Asian humeri using statistical atlas-based analysis.Methods: Forty-four CT scans of normal upper limbs were obtained from the National University Hospital, Singapore and used to construct statistical humerus atlases. The atlases were subsequently used to study the morphology of the humeri in an Asian population. Humeral shapes of different patient clusters were analyzed based on statistical shape models. Comparison between different clusters was conducted with regard to centerline, length, width and surface curvature. © 2014, CARS.","Gender differences; Humerus dimensions; Long bone dimensions; Morphological study; Population specific studies; Statistical atlas","adult; aged; computer assisted tomography; female; human; humerus; male; middle aged; photon absorptiometry; prostheses and orthoses; radiography; sex difference; surgery; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Humerus; Male; Middle Aged; Prostheses and Implants; Sex Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939894007

Understanding the mechanical influence of these dimensions (individually or in combination) on shoulder strength could help explain the mechanism of musculoskeletal disorders. The following study shows how a recently discovered geometric parameter, the area of glenoid asymmetry (AGA), is a good indicator of shoulder strength. A comprehensive study was conducted to test whether glenohumeral geometry, as measured through MRI scans, is correlated with upper arm strength. The isometric shoulder strength of 12 subjects during one-handed arm abduction and adduction in the coronal plane, in a range from 5 to 30°, was correlated with the geometries of their glenoid fossae. All subjects were stronger during adduction than abduction for all arm positions. The results revealed a high correlation in the coronal plane between the AGA and mean maximum force and mean maximum moment when an arm was abducted and adducted in a range from 5° to 30° (0.80, p ≤ 0.01 and 0.69, p ≤ 0.05, respectively during abduction and 0.61, p ≤ 0.04 and 0.61, p ≤ 0.04, respectively during adduction). This investigation revealed the repercussion of individual glenoid geometry on the maximum acceptable load applied to the hand during arm abduction and adduction in a coronal plane.","Abduction; Adduction; Articulating surfaces; Glenohumeral joint; Glenoid fossa","Bone; Geometry; Human engineering; Joints (anatomy); Magnetic resonance imaging; Musculoskeletal system; Strength of materials; Area of glenoid asymmetry (AGA); Articulating surfaces; Glenoid asymmetry; Glenoid fossa; Biomedical engineering; arm movement; article; biomechanics; controlled study; correlation analysis; geometry; human; human experiment; joint function; male; muscle force; muscle strength; musculoskeletal injury; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; range of motion; statistical significance; weight bearing; Adult; Anthropometry; Biomechanics; Exercise; Human Engineering; Humans; Male; Muscle Contraction; Muscle Strength; Muscle, Skeletal; Pilot Projects; Shoulder; Shoulder Joint; Weight-Bearing; Workload",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-35848941693
