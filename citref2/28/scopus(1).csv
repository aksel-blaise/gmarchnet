Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

Marine sediment sequences demonstrate that subtropical African climate periodically oscillated between markedly wetter and drier conditions, paced by earth orbital variations, with evidence for step-like (± 0.2 Ma) increases in African climate variability and aridity near 2.8 Ma, 1.7 Ma, and 1.0 Ma, coincident with the onset and intensification of high-latitude glacial cycles. Analysis of the best dated and most complete African mammal fossil databases indicates African faunal assemblage and, perhaps, speciation changes during the Pliocene-Pleistocene, suggesting more varied and open habitats at 2.9-2.4 Ma and after 1.8 Ma. These intervals correspond to key junctures in early hominid evolution, including the emergence of our genus Homo. Pliocene-Pleistocene shifts in African climate, vegetation, and faunal assemblages thus appear to be roughly contemporary, although detailed comparisons are hampered by sampling gaps, dating uncertainties, and preservational biases in the fossil record. Further study of possible relations between African faunal and climatic change will benefit from the accelerating pace of important new fossil discoveries, emerging molecular biomarker methods for reconstructing African paleovegetation changes, tephra correlations between terrestrial and marine sequences, as well as continuing collaborations between the paleoclimatic and paleoanthropological communities. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

Often, GLMs are used for exploratory data analysis, where one starts with a complex full model including interaction terms and then simplifies by removing non-significant terms. While this approach can be useful, it is problematic if significant effects are interpreted as if they arose from a single a priori hypothesis test. This is because model selection involves cryptic multiple hypothesis testing, a fact that has only rarely been acknowledged or quantified. We show that the probability of finding at least one 'significant' effect is high, even if all null hypotheses are true (e. g. 40% when starting with four predictors and their two-way interactions). This probability is close to theoretical expectations when the sample size (N) is large relative to the number of predictors including interactions (k). In contrast, type I error rates strongly exceed even those expectations when model simplification is applied to models that are over-fitted before simplification (low N/k ratio). The increase in false-positive results arises primarily from an overestimation of effect sizes among significant predictors, leading to upward-biased effect sizes that often cannot be reproduced in follow-up studies ('the winner's curse'). Despite having their own problems, full model tests and P value adjustments can be used as a guide to how frequently type I errors arise by sampling variation alone. We favour the presentation of full models, since they best reflect the range of predictors investigated and ensure a balanced representation also of non-significant results. © 2010 The Author(s).","Bonferroni correction; Effect size estimation; Generalised linear models; Model selection; Multiple regression; Multiple testing; Parameter estimation; Publication bias","evolutionary biology; hypothesis testing; model test; multiple regression",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027938876

Most of this change has been due to the development and adoption of methods to analyze the Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks. These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

To clarify how and when these differences arise in ontogeny, we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Honto sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96 traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology.

Reliable systems are made so that they can be counted on to work when needed. Maintainable ones can easily be made to function if they are broken or not appropriate to the task at hand. Because these design alternatives have markedly different optimal applications and observably different physical characteristics, archaeologists can link the design of prehistoric weapons to environmental constraints and to specific hunting strategies.

More than 3000 surface and excavated artefacts were recovered at 15 localities documented east and west of the Kada Gona river. Based on radioisotopic dating (40Ar/39Ar) and magnetostratigraphy, the artefacts are dated between 2·6-2·5 million years ago (Ma). EG10 and EG12 from East Gona are the most informative with the highest density, providing the best opportunity for characterizing the oldest assemblages and for understanding the stone working capability of the earliest tool makers. Slightly younger artefact occurrences dated to 2·4-2·3 Ma are known from Hadar and Omo in Ethiopia, and from Lokalalei in Kenya. Cut-marked bones dated to 2·5 Ma from Bouri in Ethiopia are now providing important clues on the function of these artefacts. In addition, Australopithecus garhi known from contemporary deposits at Bouri may be the best candidate responsible for the oldest artefacts. Surprisingly, the makers of the Gona artefacts had a sophisticated understanding of stone fracture mechanics and control similar to what is observed for Oldowan assemblages dated between 2·0-1·5 Ma. This observation was corroborated by the recent archaeological discoveries made at Lokalalei. Because of the similarities seen in the techniques of artefact manufacture during the Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene, it is argued here that the stone assemblages dated between 2·6-1·5 Ma group into the Oldowan Industry. The similarity and simplicity of the artefacts from this time interval suggests a technological stasis in the Oldowan. © 2000 Academic Press.","""Pre-Oldowan""; Early hominids; Early palaeolithic; Gona; Oldest artefacts; Oldowan","tool use",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034473526

It probably originated in Africa, spreading to Europe and Asia perhaps as early as ∼1million years (Myr) ago. The origin of the Acheulian is thought to have closely coincided with major changes in human brain evolution, allowing for further technological developments. Nonetheless, the emergence of the Acheulian remains unclear because well-dated sites older than 1.4Myr ago are scarce. Here we report on the lithic assemblage and geological context for the Kokiselei 4 archaeological site from the Nachukui formation (West Turkana, Kenya) that bears characteristic early Acheulian tools and pushes the first appearance datum for this stone-age technology back to 1.76Myr ago. Moreover, co-occurrence of Oldowan and Acheulian artefacts at the Kokiselei site complex indicates that the two technologies are not mutually exclusive time-successive components of an evolving cultural lineage, and suggests that the Acheulian was either imported from another location yet to be identified or originated from Oldowan hominins at this vicinity. In either case, the Acheulian did not accompany the first human dispersal from Africa despite being available at the time. This may indicate that multiple groups of hominins distinguished by separate stone-tool-making behaviours and dispersal strategies coexisted in Africa at 1.76Myr ago. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A modern version of the long-held savanna hypothesis posits that the expansion of grassland ecosystems in Africa was driven by global climatic change and led to the divergence of hominins from the apes and to the origin of the Homo clade. A related idea suggests that hominins originated in the late Miocene, and Homo in the late Pliocene, as constituents of broader pulses of faunal turnover synchronized by episodes of global climatic change. A more recent concept, the variability selection hypothesis, emphasizes the importance of fluctuating climates and environments, rather than any single trend, in shaping human adaptation and evolution. Here we evaluate these ideas for the Plio-Pleistocene in light of new analyses of fossil mammals from the Turkana Basin of Kenya and Ethiopia. Our results show that between 4 and 1 Ma (million years ago), there were profound faunal changes in the Turkana Basin. The most important of these changes include significant shifts in the abundance of the common families of mammals, episodes of high faunal turnover, and an increase in the number and abundance of species that show adaptations to grassland ecosystems. Episodes of relatively high faunal turnover occurred in the intervals 3.4-3.2, 2.8-2.6, 2.4-2.2, and 2.0-1.8 Ma. Paranthropus and Homo appear in the Turkana Basin during successive intervals of high turnover at 2.8-2.6 and at 2.4-2.2 Ma, while the appearance of Homo erectus is coupled to a major episode of turnover and grassland expansion after 2 Ma. Thus, there was not a single turnover pulse of relevance to late Pliocene hominins, but multiple events that successively led to the appearance of Paranthropus, early Homo, and H. erectus. Our results also show evidence of large-scale, 100 ky-periodicity shifts in the fauna beginning at 2.5 Ma, during the time that Homo and lithic artifacts first appear in the Turkana Basin, lending support to the variability selection hypothesis [Science 273 (1996) 922; Potts R., 1996b. Humanity's Descent: The Consequences of Ecological Instability. Avon Books, New York.] during the latest Pliocene. The savanna hypothesis may not explain the divergence of hominins from other apes, but it could be correct in stressing the importance of grasslands to the early evolution of Homo. The fundamental importance of grasslands may lie in the complexity and heterogeneity they added to the range of habitats available to the early species of the genus Homo. The turnover pulse hypothesis [Vrba, E.S., 1988. Late Pliocene climatic events and hominid evolution. In: Grine, F.E (Ed.). Evolutionary History of the ""Robust"" Australopithecines. Aldine, New York, pp. 405-426; Vrba, E.S., 1995. The fossil record of African antelopes (Mammalia, Bovidae) in relation to human evolution and paleoclimate.

Press, New Haven, pp. 385-424.] may be correct in linking critical events in human evolution to broader pulses of faunal change ultimately driven by climate, but our results show that any such link is complex, with at least four rather than one pulse of change during the Pliocene and early Pleistocene of the Turkana Basin.","Faunal change; Grasslands; Homo; Lower Omo valley; Paranthropus; Plio-Pleistocene hominins; Turkana basin","evolution; grassland; mammal; paleoclimate; paleoecology; Pleistocene; Pliocene; savanna; vegetation history; Africa; East Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Turkana Basin; Alocasia macrorrhizos; Bovidae; Hominidae; Homo; Homo; Homo erectus; Homo erectus; Mammalia; Paranthropus; Paranthropus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-2642542713

New research now shows that the Member 4 australopithecine breccia (2.8-2.6 Ma) extends further west than was previously thought, while a late phase of Member 4 is recognized in a southern area. The artefact-bearing breccias were defined sedimentologically as Member 5, but one supposed part of these younger breccias, the StW 53 infill, lacks in situ stone tools, although it does appear to post-date 2.6 Ma when artefacts first appear in the archaeological record. The StW 53 hominid, previously referred to Homo habilis, is here argued to be Australopithecus. The first artefact-bearing breccia of Member 5 is the Oldowan Infill, estimated at 2-1.7 Ma. It occupies a restricted distribution in Member 5 east and contains an expedient, flake-based tool industry associated with a few fossils of Paranthropos robustus. An enlarged cave opening subsequently admitted one or more Early Acheulean infills associated in Member 5 west with Homo ergaster. The artefacts attest to a larger site accumulation between ca. 1.7 and 1.4 Ma, with more intensive use of quartzite over quartz and a subtle but important shift to large flakes and heavier-duty tools. The available information on palaeoenvironments is summarized, showing an overall change from tropical to sub-tropical gallery forest, forest fringe and woodland conditions in Member 4 to more open woodland and grassland habitats in the later units, but with suggestions of a wet localized topography in the Paranthropus-bearing Oldowan Infill.

With regard to early hominid technological development, the evidence provided by the data from 2.34 Myr site of Lokalalei 2C (Kenya) questions both the prior assumption of a continuous and linear evolutionary trend in lithic production and the idea that it long remained static. The level of elaboration evinced by the lithic assemblage is quite unexpected in view of its age, and seemingly more advanced that what can be surmised for other Late Pliocene East-African sites, including the nearby site of Lokalalei 1. Analysis relies mainly on the dynamic reconstruction of entire cobble reduction sequences from particularly informative refitting groups. The Lokalalei 2C knappers had already internalised the notion of planning and foresight in raw material procurement and management. Beyond simple mastery of the basic technical constraints peculiar to stone knapping, they conducted a highly controlled débitage of flakes following constant technical rules and resulting in high productivity. The data suggest that early hominids displayed distinct technical competencies and techno-economic patterns of behavior, thus pointing to an intrasite complexity and intersite diversity which are not accounted for by the existing chrono-cultural classifications. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Although stone tool assemblages attributed to the Acheulean have been reported from as early as circa 1.6-1.75 Ma, the characteristics of these earliest occurrences and comparisons with later assemblages have not been reported in detail. Here, we provide a newly established chronometric calibration for the Acheulean assemblages of the Konso Formation, southern Ethiopia, which span the time period ∼1.75 to <1.0 Ma. The earliest Konso Acheulean is chronologically indistinguishable from the assemblage recently published as the world's earliest with an age of ∼1.75 Ma at Kokiselei, west of Lake Turkana, Kenya. This Konso assemblage is characterized by a combination of large picks and crude bifaces/unifaces made predominantly on large flake blanks. An increase in the number of flake scars was observed within the Konso Formation handaxe assemblages through time, but this was less so with picks. The Konso evidence suggests that both picks and handaxes were essential components of the Acheulean from its initial stages and that the two probably differed in function. The temporal refinement seen, especially in the handaxe forms at Konso, implies enhanced function through time, perhaps in processing carcasses with long and stable cutting edges. The documentation of the earliest Acheulean at ∼1.75 Ma in both northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia suggests that behavioral novelties were being established in a regional scale at that time, paralleling the emergence of Homo erectus-like hominid morphology.","Chronostratigraphy; Early pleistocene; Lithic technology development","archeology; article; calibration; carcass; chronology; Ethiopia; general device; handaxe; Kenya; Konso formation; pick; priority journal; Animals; Archaeology; Argon; Chronology as Topic; Ethiopia; Fossils; Hominidae; Isotopes; Radioisotopes; Radiometric Dating; Technology; Time Factors; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873168564

These periods of extreme climate variability appear to correlate with maxima in the 400-thousand-year (kyr) component of the Earth's eccentricity cycle. Prior to 2.7 Ma the wet phases appear every 400 kyrs, whereas after 2.7 Ma, the wet phases appear every 800 kyrs, with periods of precessional-forced extreme climate variability at 2.7-2.5 Ma, 1.9-1.7 Ma, and 1.1-0.9 Ma before present. The last three major lake phases occur at the times of major global climatic transitions, such as the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (2.7-2.5 Ma), intensification of the Walker Circulation (1.9-1.7 Ma), and the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (1.0-0.7 Ma). High-latitude forcing is required to compress the Intertropical Convergence Zone so that East Africa becomes locally sensitive to precessional forcing, resulting in rapid shifts from wet to dry conditions.

This aridification trend is marked by several punctuations at 3.58-3.35, 2.52-2, and 1.81-1.58 Ma, during which the running mean and variance of δ13C and paleoaridity estimates increase, suggesting that the proportion of C4 biomass increases in savanna mosaics during periods of heightened aridity. Increase in C4 biomass during these aridification events not only increases the proportion of open habitats, but increases the spatial neg-entropy, or heterogeneity of the ecosystem. The aridification events identified correspond to intervals of increased turnover, but more importantly, increased diversity of bovids. Although the record of hominins from the Turkana Basin lacks the temporal resolution and diversity of the bovid record, the aridification intervals identified are marked by similar increases in the diversity and turnover of hominins. These results support the hypothesis that hominins evolved in savanna mosaics that changed through time, and suggest that the evolution of bovids and hominins was driven by shifts in climatic instability and habitat variability, both diachronic and synchronic. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Aridity; Carbon isotope; East Africa; Environmental change; Paleohabitat; Pleistocene; Pliocene","article; biomass; bovids; climate change; desert; ecosystem; entropy; environmental change; evaluation; evolution; habitat quality; hominid; hypothesis; Kenya; measurement; pleistocene; pliocene; precipitation; savanna; technique; theoretical model; Animals; Climate; Evolution; Geologic Sediments; Hominidae; Humans; Kenya",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1642457361

This approach requires (1) precise definition of narrow stratigraphic intervals based on sedimentary criteria that can be documented over a broad area, and (2) excavation of these intervals in order to establish taphonomic and paleoenvironmental contexts. In this report, excavations of three target intervals within the early Pleistocene deposits (992 to 780 ka) of the Olorgesailie basin are described. Assessment of time-averaging and paleolandscape structure shows that each target interval represents a relatively brief period (≤ 1000 yrs) and exhibits a unique distribution of environmental features (e.g., topographic gradients, channels, soil development). Stone artefacts and fossilized animal bones are distributed nonrandomly in each interval, and include clusters that were five to 293 times more densely concentrated than the laterally equivalent background scatter. A paleosol in upper Member 1 preserves a relatively continuous distribution of artefacts and fossils, in contrast with the more patchy distribution in two intervals of lower Member 7. We infer that the difference between the two members reflects a real variation in hominid land use-either a response to local environmental differences or perhaps a change through time in hominid interaction with the environment. By expanding the comparative analysis to diverse basins, it should be possible to test for broader evolutionary change in hominid activities. Examples drawn from East African Pliocene and early Pleistocene sites suggest that evolutionary change in land use entailed (1) wider ranging of hominids and longer distances of stone transport, (2) expansion of tool-assisted behaviors to a wider diversity of environmental settings, and (3) more strongly focused placement of particular artefact forms (e.g., bifaces) in different areas of the landscape in response to specific environmental features, such as lava outcrops, stream channels, and lake margins.","Acheulean; Early hominid behavior; Fluvial deposition; Fossilized bones; Land use; Olorgesailie; Paleoecology; Paleolandscape; Paleosol; Stone tools; Taphonomy","Acheulean; habitat use; landscape; paleosol; Pleistocene; Kenya; Kenya Rift",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033226752

Is this extraordinary complexity a product of cognitive evolution, cultural evolution or some interaction of the two? Answering this question will require a much better understanding of patterns of increasing cultural diversity, complexity and rates of change in human evolution. Palaeolithic stone tools provide a relatively abundant and continuous record of such change, but a systematic method for describing the complexity and diversity of these early technologies has yet to be developed. Here, an initial attempt at such a system is presented. Results suggest that rates of Palaeolithic culture change may have been underestimated and that there is a direct relationship between increasing technological complexity and diversity. Cognitive evolution and the greater latitude for cultural variation afforded by increasingly complex technologies may play complementary roles in explaining this pattern. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Acheulean; Cumulative culture; Hierarchical behaviour; Oldowan; Palaeolithic; Technology","Acheulean; archaeological evidence; cognition; cultural change; cultural history; cultural tradition; hierarchical system; Paleolithic; Stone Age; tool use; article; cognition; cultural anthropology; human; tool use; Anthropology, Cultural; Cognition; Culture; Humans; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953273347

The oldest sites are in Africa at around 1.6 million years ago and the most recent approach the last 100,000 years. The geographical extent is also enormous, ranging across Africa, the Middle East, most of Europe and large parts of Asia. Is it however a real tradition? The Acheulean represents a set of stone-working ideas that endure, but the strength of 'tradition' is often an assumption made by archaeologists. This paper re-examines Acheulean biface variation, looking at sets of assemblages measured in different ways, but amenable to discriminant analysis (DFA), which is able to highlight differences useful in classification. The analyses show significant differences between European and African assemblages. In the case of the Far East, in line with others, we provide further analyses suggestive of technological differences between putative 'handaxes' from Korea and some 'classic' western assemblages. However, it is not yet fully clear how far a 'typical' Acheulean tradition is represented, as matching of Far Eastern assemblages to other parts of the world depends to an extent upon the criteria used. With regard to the more general Acheulean paradox, the paper notes parallels in biological studies with the idea that a single widely extending phenomenon can incorporate elements of both unity and diversity.","Acheulean; Handaxes; Movius Line; Social transmission; Traditions; Variation","archaeological evidence; archaeology; cultural history; cultural tradition; discriminant analysis; documentary source; historical geography; human settlement; Paleolithic",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-49549109415

There are several reasons handaxes are used for this purpose, but principal among these is the notion that handaxe shape is an arbitrary imposition of form, on varied raw material, that reflects shared mental templates. If this is so, then changes in handaxe shape through time and space may speak directly to evolving mental capabilities. It is argued here, however, that far too little attention has been paid to much simpler levels of explanation that may say much less about mental capabilities. This point is illustrated by re-examining some data sets that have been used by others to show patterns in handaxe shape interpreted as reflecting differences in mental constructs or for elevated mental abilities. It will be argued here that some very basic factors, such as raw materials and reduction intensity, are better able to explain the observed patterns. As a result, the existence of mental templates for preferred handaxe shapes seems unlikely.

African climate is controlled by major tectonic changes, global climate transitions, and local variations in orbital forcing. We introduce the special African Paleoclimate Issue of the Journal of Human Evolution by providing a background for and synthesis of the latest work relating to the environmental context for human evolution. Records presented in this special issue suggest that the regional tectonics, appearance of C4 plants in East Africa, and late Cenozoic global cooling combined to produce a long-term drying trend in East Africa. Of particular importance is the uplift associated with the East African Rift Valley formation, which altered wind flow patterns from a more zonal to more meridinal direction. Results in this volume suggest a marked difference in the climate history of southern and eastern Africa, though both are clearly influenced by the major global climate thresholds crossed in the last 3 million years. Papers in this volume present lake, speleothem, and marine paleoclimate records showing that the East African long-term drying trend is punctuated by episodes of short, alternating periods of extreme wetness and aridity. These periods of extreme climate variability are characterized by the precession-forced appearance and disappearance of large, deep lakes in the East African Rift Valley and paralleled by low and high wind-driven dust loads reaching the adjacent ocean basins. Dating of these records show that over the last 3 million years such periods only occur at the times of major global climatic transitions, such as the intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (2.7-2.5 Ma), intensification of the Walker Circulation (1.9-1.7 Ma), and the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution (1-0.7 Ma). Authors in this volume suggest this onset occurs as high latitude forcing in both Hemispheres compresses the Intertropical Convergence Zone so that East Africa becomes locally sensitive to precessional forcing, resulting in rapid shifts from wet to dry conditions. These periods of extreme climate variability may have provided a catalyst for evolutionary change and driven key speciation and dispersal events amongst mammals and hominins in Africa. In particular, hominin species seem to differentially originate and go extinct during periods of extreme climate variability.

We examine and put into paleogeographic context the known archaeological traces in the Turkana Basin at three successive time intervals: 2.3 million years ago (Ma), 1.9-1.8 Ma, and 1.7-1.5 Ma. At 2.3 Ma, hominid use of stone appears restricted to small areas on the landscape where many resources such as water, shade, and stone are juxtaposed. In contrast, archaeological traces at 1.6 Ma are found in a variety of settings, which may in part be explained by the paleogeographic changes taking place at that time. This change coincides with the emergence of Homo erectus. The hominid fossil and archaeological records are shown to complement each other in the generation of ecological hypotheses of H. erectus behaviour. © 1994 Academic Press.

There are numerous studies suggesting Oldowan hominins preferred certain types of stone for artifact manufacture. Previous studies of the artifact assemblage from the early Pliocene Oldowan locality of Kanjera South (South Rachuonyo District, Kenya) show that raw material selection and transport was an important aspect of Late Pliocene hominin adaptations. Yet the exact properties of stones that hominins were selecting remain enigmatic. Two potentially important features of artifact raw material are durability and fracture predictability. We investigate fracture predictability through mechanical tests of stone and investigations of the affect of stone properties on fracture patterns in archaeological collections. We investigate stone durability with actualistic studies of edge attrition combined with further mechanical tests of various lithologies. Oldowan hominins at Kanjera appear to have selected raw materials based on their durability. The ability for a stone to fracture consistently does not appear to be as important in hominin toolstone preference as previously assumed. Hominins that produced the assemblages at Kanjera South appear to have incorporated an extensive understanding of various attributes of raw material in the transport and production of stone artifacts. When combined with previous research on the transport patterns at Kanjera, the results of this study provide evidence for a more complex raw material acquisition strategy than has previously been suggested for Late Pliocene Oldowan hominins. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

There is widespread agreement that Clovis and related cultures of the Early Paleoindian period (∼11,500-10,500 BP) represent the first well-documented indications of human occupation, but considerable differences of opinion exist regarding the origins of these cultures. Here, we report the results of a study in which data from a continent-wide sample of Early Paleoindian projectile points were analyzed with cladistic methods in order to assess competing models of colonization as well as several alternative explanations for the variation among the points, including adaptation to local environmental circumstances, cultural diffusion, and site type effects. The analyses suggest that a rapidly migrating population produced the Early Paleoindian projectile point assemblages. They also suggest that the population in question is unlikely to have entered North America from either the Isthmus of Panama or the Midatlantic region. According to the analyses, the Early Paleoindians are more likely to have entered North America via either the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that is hypothesized to have opened around 12,000 BP, or the Northwest Coast. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This study uses carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of pedogenic carbonates to examine environmental variability across ~5000km2 within the Omo-Turkana Basin. An expanded isotopic dataset, including the first isotopic data on pedogenic carbonates from the Shungura Formation and new data from the Nachukui and Koobi Fora formations, is compared to published isotopic records from both the Omo-Turkana Basin and the lower Awash Basin, Ethiopia. Regionally, the carbon isotope record indicates a steady increase of C4 vegetation in floodplain environments for the past 4million years. The oxygen isotopic record indicates that the isotopic composition of rainfall was depleted in 18O relative to today's waters and that both basins likely received more rainfall in the Pliocene than today. A shift to higher δ18O values in paleosol carbonate after 2Ma in the Omo-Turkana Basin but not in the lower Awash Basin suggests that the ecology and hydrology in these two rift basins were influenced by different climatic regimes. In addition to regional trends, pedogenic carbonates sampled from different parts of the basin show that the distribution of C4 vegetation and soil water δ18O values varied with proximity to the axial river system, and specifically that C3 vegetation was more dominant in soils of the Shungura Formation compared with coeval sediments downstream in the Nachukui and Koobi Fora formations. This large isotopic dataset from pedogenic carbonates provides the opportunity to examine how terrestrial systems responded to global climate change during the last 4million years, from both local and regional perspectives. The isotopic data indicate that local basin and climate dynamics strongly influenced the impact of large-scale environmental change in East African rift basins. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon isotopes; East Africa; Omo-Turkana Basin; Oxygen isotopes; Pedogenic carbonate; Pleistocene; Pliocene","C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon isotope; carbonate; climate change; data set; environmental change; floodplain; fossil record; hydrology; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; oxygen isotope; paleobotany; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; paleosol; Pleistocene; Pliocene; sedimentary rock; vegetation structure; East Africa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960407026

This paper brings together sedimentologic and isotopic evidence for the paleoenvironmental context of early hominids from both formations, but with particular emphasis on the setting for the early toolmakers. The pre-2.92 Ma record (Hadar Formation) is characterized by low-gradient fluvial, paludal, and lacustrine deposition in an undissected topography most analogous to reaches of the modern middle Awash River near Gewane. The Gona area experienced repeated deep dissection and aggradation by the Awash River, starting between 2.92 and ca. 2.7 Ma and continuing through the top of the record at &lt;0.6 Ma (Busidima Formation). Each aggradational succession is 10-20 m in thickness and fines upward from well-rounded conglomerates at the base to capping paleosols at the top. During this period the ancestral Awash represented by these fining upward sequences was dominantly meandering and flowed northeast, as it does today. Smaller channels tributary to the axial Awash system are also extensively exposed in the Busidima Formation. Compared to the axial-system conglomerates, the tributary channels transported finer, less mature volcanic clasts mixed with abundant carbonate nodules reworked from adjacent badlands. Stone artifacts (Oldowan; 2.6-2.0 Ma) at the oldest archaeological sites are only associated with the axial Awash system, in the bedded silts or capping paleosols of the fining upward sequences. The implements were made from rounded cobbles from the channels, but manufacture and use of the tools was always away from the channel bars, on the nearby sandy banks and silt-dominated floodplains. Archaeological sites higher in the record (Acheulian; &lt;1.7 Ma) occur in similar axial river contexts, as well as along tributary channels further removed from artifact raw material sources. Mature paleosols in the Hadar and Busidima Formations are mostly pale to darkbrown Vertisols typified by abundant clay slickensides, pseudo-anticlinal and vertical fracturing, and carbonate nodules. Such calcic Vertisols are common in the region today, demonstrating that the paleoclimate over the past 3.4 m.y. has been semi-arid and strongly seasonal. Carbon isotopic results from pedogenic carbonates in the Vertisols allow reconstruction of the proportion of C3 plants (trees and shrubs) to C4 plants (grasses) through time. The δ 13C results from the Hadar Formation prior to 2.9 Ma range from -9.3‰ to -4.1‰, indicating a dominantly forested environment but with locally substantial (average 34%) grasses on the Awash floodplain. The δ13C values from soil carbonate in the lower Busidima Formation (2.7-1.6 Ma) increase (-6.5‰ to -2.7‰) in floodplain paleosols, indicating ∼ 50% average grass cover.

Cosmogenic nuclide burial dating of an ancient alluvial deposit of the Vaal River (Rietputs Formation) in the western interior of South Africa shows that coarse gravel and sand aggradation there occurred ca 1.57 ± 0.22 Ma, with individual ages of samples ranging from 1.89 ± 0.19 to 1.34 ± 0.22 Ma. This was followed by aggradation of laminated and cross-bedded fine alluvium at ca 1.26 ± 0.10 Ma. The Rietputs Formation provides an ideal situation for the use of the cosmogenic nuclide burial dating method, as samples could be obtained from deep mining pits at depths ranging from 7 to 16 meters. Individual dates provide only a minimum age for the stone tool technology preserved within the deposits. Each assemblage represents a time averaged collection. Bifacial tools distributed throughout the coarse gravel and sand unit can be assigned to an early phase of the Acheulean. This is the first absolute radiometric dated evidence for early Acheulean artefacts in South Africa that have been found outside of the early hominid sites of the Gauteng Province. These absolute dates also indicate that handaxe-using hominids inhabited southern Africa as early as their counterparts in East Africa. The simultaneous appearance of the Acheulean in different parts of the continent implies relatively rapid technology development and the widespread use of large cutting tools in the African continent by ca 1.6 Ma. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In Palaeolithic archaeology's sister discipline of palaeoanthropology, detailed quantitative morphometric, geometric morphometric, and even 3D geometric morphometric analyses are now seen almost as routine. This period of relative methodological stasis may have been influenced by the lack of homologous landmarks on many lithic tools (essential for any comparative analysis), especially core-based technologies of the Lower Palaeolithic. Archaeological field conditions may also prohibit the use of expensive and delicate precision instruments in certain cases. Here we present a crossbeam co-ordinate caliper that - crucially - both geometrically locates and measures distances between morphologically homologous landmarks upon lithic nuclei via a single protocol. Intra- and inter-observer error tests provide evidence that error levels associated with the instrument fall within acceptable ranges. In addition, we present empirical examples of application in the form of a multivariate analysis of 55 discrete morphometric variables, and a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of co-ordinate landmark configurations derived from Pleistocene lithic nuclei (i.e. 'cores' sensu lato). We also introduce to lithic studies some techniques for the study of shape variation that have previously been used with success in biological morphometric analyses. We conclude that use of an instrument such as the crossbeam co-ordinate caliper may provide a useful adjunct to traditional techniques of lithic analysis, particularly in developing a quantitative morphometric approach. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This three-dimensional technique is compared with conventional two-dimensional methods to investigate which methods capture morphological variation in the assemblage most comprehensively. Additionally, a set of experimentally produced bifacial tools are incorporated into the analyses to isolate the behavioral pattern underpinning identified variation in the archaeological assemblage. The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture. The intensity with which this strategy was applied seems to have been mediated by the availability of raw material that was suitable for the production of large bifacial tools. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Two different sets of raw material properties are thought to influence artifact form. The first set is internal, and related to mechanical flaking properties. The second set is external, namely the form (size, shape, presence of cortex) of the initial nodule or blank from which flakes are struck. We conducted a replication experiment designed to determine whether handaxe morphology was influenced by raw materials of demonstrably different internal and external properties: flint, basalt, and obsidian. The knapper was instructed to copy a ""target"" model handaxe, produced by a different knapper, 35 times in each toolstone type (n=105 handaxes). On each experimental handaxe, 29 size-adjusted (scale-free) morphometric variables were recorded to capture the overall shape of each handaxe in order to compare them statistically to the model. Both Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) were used to determine if raw material properties were a primary determinate of patterns of overall shape differences across the toolstone groups. The PCA results demonstrated that variation in all three toolstones was distributed evenly around the model target form. The MANOVA of all 29 size-adjusted variables, using two different tests, showed no statistically significant differences in overall shape patterns between the three groups of raw material. In sum, our results show that assuming the primacy of raw material differences as the predominant explanatory factor in stone tool morphology, or variation between assemblages, is unwarranted. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Acheulean; Experiment; Experimental archaeology; Handaxes; Raw material","Acheulean; archaeological evidence; archaeology; artifact; experimental study; lithic fragment; tool use",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903479054

Variation in reduction intensity suggests that tools are not always discarded in patterns that would be predicted by the availability of raw material. Further, it appears that hominin transport decisions involved an assessment of the potential use-life of certain forms.

It represents the emergence of a complex behavior, expressed in the recurrent manufacture of large-sized tools, with standardized forms, implying more advance forethought and planning by hominins than those required by the precedent Oldowan technology. The earliest known evidence of this technology dates back to c. 1.7 Ma. and is limited to two sites (Kokiselei [Kenya] and Konso [Ethiopia]), both of which lack functionally-associated fauna. The functionality of these earliest Acheulean assemblages remains unknown. Here we present the discovery of another early Acheulean site also dating to c. 1.7 Ma from Olduvai Gorge. This site provides evidence of the earliest steps in developing the Acheulean technology and is the oldest Acheulean site in which stone tools occur spatially and functionally associated with the exploitation of fauna. Simple and elaborate large-cutting tools (LCT) and bifacial handaxes co-exist at FLK West, showing that complex cognition was present from the earliest stages of the Acheulean. Here we provide a detailed technological study and evidence of the use of these tools on the butchery and consumption of fauna, probably by early Homo erectus sensu lato.",,"animal; fossil; geology; human; Tanzania; time factor; tool use; Animals; Fossils; Geology; Humans; Tanzania; Time Factors; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949491348

To investigate this topic, we examined lithic collections from the early Middle Pleistocene Acheulean site of Boxgrove for evidence of the use of platform preparation as a biface thinning technique. To aid in the identification and assessment of platform preparation, Boxgrove artifacts were compared with experimental products of Inexperienced, Novice, and Expert stone knappers. Results demonstrate the technologically efficacious use of platform preparation among the Boxgrove toolmakers ~500 thousand years ago, providing the first direct evidence of this technique in the Acheulean. The use of platform preparation in bifacial thinning increases the complexity of toolmaking action sequences and has implications for understanding the neurocognitive substrates, social transmission, and spatiotemporal distribution of Late Acheulean technology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biface; Britain; Handaxe; Knapping; Paleolithic; Skill","Acheulean; archaeology; artifact; cognition; technology; tool use; archaeological evidence; lithic fragment; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; technological development; United Kingdom",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886239440

Theoretically, stone artifact traces of Oldowan hominin land use are determined by the distribution of larger mammal carcasses and arboreal refuge from predation as well as proximity to stone material sources. We provide an initial evaluation of these theoretical expectations, focusing on the effects of distance from stone source on four parameters of Oldowan artifact assemblages from the lowermost Bed II eastern Olduvai Basin. Quartzite artifact assemblages show expected distance-from-material-source trends relative to their straight-line proximity to three of four points along Naibor Soit, a local quartzitic inselberg. The weight density and proportionate weight of quartzite assemblages decrease with increasing distance from Naibor Soit, as do the size of flaked pieces and the proportion of these that are minimally reduced. The results demonstrate predicted behavioral patterning in broad-scale traces of hominin land use, but proximity to Naibor Soit explains the majority of variability in only the weight proportion of stone artifacts made on quartzite. Ecological factors appear to have also influenced the landscape distribution of Oldowan hominin activity traces. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Acheulean hand-axes were made in a range of sizes, from ca. 8-30 cm in length, and are superficially similar in form at different sizes, even though functional requirements might be expected to vary. To make an appropriate study of three-dimensional form we require a method for analysing size-related change in multiple measures of form. Jolicoeur's multivariate generalization of the allometric equation, (y = bx4), provides a suitable technique, based on the angular relationships of co-ordinates for each measure to the first principal component of the covariance matrix. We have applied this approach to an analysis of several biface assemblages from separate parts of the Kilombe site complex. Allometry is an important component in all the localities, but one area observes a different set of adjustments. We argue that the allometry is probably imposed in response to functional requirements: it suggests that Homo erectus was constrained to follow a number of different guiding principles in the manufacturing process.

The two major unresolved issues are: the absence of a climate proxy yielding high-resolution (&lt;20kyr) terrestrial climate records, and the lack of age control on hominin fossil occurrences at sufficiently high resolution. Here we present a novel climate proxy, strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) of lacustrine fish fossils from the Turkana Basin, that solves these issues by recording orbitally forced variation in summer monsoon intensity over the Ethiopian Highlands. We successfully applied the climate proxy to a ~150kyr time interval of ~2million year old paleolake deposits containing hominin fossils. Existing age control of the studied interval was improved by a new magnetostratigraphic record precisely locating the base of the Olduvai chron (C2n) near the bottom of the sequence. Spectral analysis demonstrates that 87Sr/86Sr variability is primarily determined by precession, which enables us to place hominin fossils in an astronomically-tuned climate framework. The Sr climate proxy is potentially applicable to all hominin-bearing lake deposits in the Turkana Basin, ranging in age from ~4.2 to 0.8million years ago (Ma). Our results demonstrate that between ~2 and 1.85Ma the Turkana Basin remained well-watered and inhabited by hominins even during periods of precession maxima when summer monsoon intensity was lowest. This is in contrast to other basins in the East African Rift System (EARS) that were impacted heavily by precession-forced droughts. We hypothesize that during lake phases, the Turkana Basin was an aridity refugium for permanent-water dependent fauna - including hominins - over the precessional climate cycles. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Aridity refugium; Fish apatite; Olduvai chron; Precession cycles; Strontium isotopes","Age control; Aridity refugium; Climate cycle; Climate proxies; Climate record; East African Rift; High resolution; Hominins; Lake deposits; Olduvai chron; Paleoanthropology; Precession cycles; Spectral analysis; Strontium isotopes; Summer monsoon; Time interval; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Deposits; Isotopes; Lakes; Phosphate minerals; Spectrum analysis; Strontium; Strontium deposits; Climate control; age determination; aridity; biostratigraphy; fossil record; geochronology; hominid; magnetostratigraphy; Olduvai event; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; refugium; strontium isotope; East African Rift; Turkana Basin",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957955718

This review highlights the various ways the Omo-Turkana Basin fossil record has contributed to, and continues to challenge, interpretations of human evolution. Despite many diagrams that look suspiciously like comprehensive hypotheses about human evolutionary history, any sensible paleoanthropologist knows that the early hominin fossil record is too meager to do anything other than offer very provisional statements about hominin taxonomy and phylogeny. If history tells us anything, it is that we still have much to learn about the hominin clade. Thus, we summarize the current state of knowledge of the hominin species represented at the Omo-Turkana Basin sites. We then focus on three specific topics for which the fossil evidence is especially relevant: the origin and nature of Paranthropus; the origin and nature of early Homo; and the ongoing debate about whether the pattern of human evolution is more consistent with speciation by cladogenesis, with greater taxonomic diversity or with speciation by anagenetic transformation, resulting in less taxonomic diversity and a more linear interpretation of human evolutionary history. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Australopithecus; East Africa; Homo; Paranthropus; Taxonomy","animal; article; Ethiopia; evolution; fossil; hominid; human; Kenya; Animals; Biological Evolution; Ethiopia; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Kenya",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-83655172315

Several Paleolithic sites with lithic assemblages attributable to the Acheulean Industrial Complex (Mode 2) have yielded bifacial bone artifacts. Many of these bone implements are similar to classic handaxes in plan shape. The arbitrary imposition of form represented by these bone bifaces suggests the deliberate application of certain operational concepts that originate from particular Acheulean technological behaviors, namely, stone handaxe manufacture. In addition, the presence of these bone tools suggests an application of specific reductive techniques that originated in both Mode 1 (i.e., Oldowan) and Mode 2 (i.e., Acheulean) lithic technologies. How does the Acheulean model for stone biface shape compare to that observed for bone biface shape? In order to understand the degree to which Acheulean stone bifaces may have served as a model of form in flaked bone technology, an objective method for evaluating form is necessary. The dimensionless approach of geometric morphometrics was applied to the study of 2D bone and stone biface plan shape. The similarity of bone and stone bifaces from the Middle Pleistocene (∼300 kya) Acheulean site Castel di Guido, Latium, Italy was evaluated by a geometric morphometric analysis of 2D outlines. The null hypothesis that there is no difference in the 2D shape of each artifact material class was tested by principal component analysis (PCA) and MANOVA/CVA of eigenshape scores. Results of the analysis show no significant difference between the plan morphology of bone and stone bifaces. These results may indicate that Acheulean concepts of preferred 2D shape were applied in the production of some bifacial bone tools and that a great disparity in raw materials did not significantly influence 2D biface morphology. Furthermore, these results lend support to the idea that Mode 2 stone flaking techniques and tool types were directly applied to bone materials in some instances. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051798141

This truism means that tools were reduced from larger pieces in the production process. But many tools were further reduced in use, to repair damage or as edges dulled. Reduction reduced size (trivially), but also changed the proportions among tools' elements or dimensions. Such allometric variation (change in proportion as a function of change in size) is useful to estimate the degree of reduction that tools experienced. Reduction itself is a measure of curation, a theoretical concept of great interest in lithic studies and Paleolithic archaeology. To determine the reduction that archaeological tools experienced, we must compare their size and proportions at first use to the same properties at discard that we directly measure. By now many size estimates can be made from discarded tools. Some are experimentally tested but few are validated using direct ethnoarchaeological controls. We validate two allometric reduction measures-ratios of plan area to thickness and of an estimate of original to discarded volume-against direct measures of use and reduction in ethnographic Gamo hidescrapers from Ethiopia. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Many reconstructions of lithic tool production utilising refit data concentrate upon 'how' a piece of stone is taken apart, and less often consider the 'when' and 'where'. Lower Palaeolithic artefacts are frequently viewed as belonging to simplistic technical systems in which tools were made and used as and when required, showing little temporal depth. Modern knappers can replicate the components of the Acheulean toolkit, such as a biface, in around 15 minutes. The predominant use of local raw materials and the relatively simple reduction sequences observed on many Middle Pleistocene sites has given rise to the view that Acheulean hominins possessed an immediate approach to technology, and that artefacts did not stay in the technological system very long. In contrast, other researchers have stressed the increased planning abilities of hominins in relation to their stone tool-making and using routines. Increased planning abilities are often cited as a diagnostic feature of modern human cognition. As such, tracing the emergence of these abilities is an important avenue of research in human evolution. The aim of this paper is to investigate how the process of lithic production was organised on several Middle Pleistocene sites in northwest Europe. By comparing refitting sequences from several primary context sites, the different stages of reduction present at these locations can be reconstructed. Since refit sets record the work carried out in one place and time by an individual, they can be used to reconstruct the spatial and temporal dimension of these past technological activities. The analysis shows fragmentation of reduction sequences was a common occurrence, suggesting a more dynamic approach to tool-making and using activities than has previously been recognised. The analysis provides a description of these artefact dynamics, and discusses the underlying cognitive mechanisms of this behaviour. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

I review the fossil evidence from ~2.5 to 1.5 Ma in light of new finds and analyses that challenge previous inferences. Minimally, three cranial morphs of early Homo (including Homo erectus) exist in eastern Africa (1.9-1.4 Ma), with at least two in southern Africa. Because of taphonomic damage to the type specimen of Homo habilis, in East Africa two species with different masticatory adaptations are better identified by their main specimen (i.e., the 1813 group and the 1470 group) rather than a species name. Until recently, the 1470 group comprised a single specimen. South African early Homo are likely distinct from these groups. Together, contemporary early H. erectus and early Homo are bigger than Australopithecus (~30%). Early H. erectus (including recently discovered small specimens) is larger than non-erectus Homo (~15%-25%), but their size ranges overlap. All early Homo are likely to exhibit substantial sexual dimorphism. Early H. erectus is less ""modern"" and its regional variation in size more substantial than previously allowed.

Older sites such as Gombore I, Karre I, and Garba IV (1.7-1.5Ma) were classified as Oldowan/Developed Oldowan. Consequently, the Oldowan and the Acheulean at Melka Kunture were interpreted as two distinct technologies separated by a chronological gap of 0.5Ma.The archaeostratigraphic unit D of Garba IV, dated to ~1.5Ma, yielded one of the richest Early Stone Age lithic series in East Africa. In this paper, a review traces methods of technological analysis, based on the concept of chaîne opératoire, to update our knowledge of the techno-economic behaviours at this site. The results show two major elements characteristic of cultural changes in the Melka Kunture sequence: (1) the emergence of a new chaîne opératoire focused on large flake/large cutting tool (LCT) production, and (2) a large variability of small débitage modalities with systematic preparation of the striking platform and the appearance of a certain degree of predetermination.These technological traits are shared by the contemporaneous sites in East Africa and are considered to be typical of the early Acheulean.

This model, which is described in terms of climate variability stages, implies repeated increases in landscape/resource instability and intervening periods of stability in East Africa. It predicts eight prolonged (>192 kyr) eras of intensified habitat instability (high variability stages) in which hominin evolutionary innovations are likely to have occurred, potentially by variability selection. The prediction that repeated shifts toward high climate variability affected paleoenvironments and evolution is tested in three ways. In the first test, deep-sea records of northeast African terrigenous dust flux (Sites 721/722) and eastern Mediterranean sapropels (Site 967A) show increased and decreased variability in concert with predicted shifts in climate variability. These regional measurements of climate dynamics are complemented by stratigraphic observations in five basins with lengthy stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental records: the mid-Pleistocene Olorgesailie Basin, the Plio-Pleistocene Turkana and Olduvai Basins, and the Pliocene Tugen Hills sequence and Hadar Basin-all of which show that highly variable landscapes inhabited by hominin populations were indeed concentrated in predicted stages of prolonged high climate variability. Second, stringent null-model tests demonstrate a significant association of currently known first and last appearance datums (FADs and LADs) of the major hominin lineages, suites of technological behaviors, and dispersal events with the predicted intervals of prolonged high climate variability. Palynological study in the Nihewan Basin, China, provides a third test, which shows the occupation of highly diverse habitats in eastern Asia, consistent with the predicted increase in adaptability in dispersing Oldowan hominins. Integration of fossil, archeological, sedimentary, and paleolandscape evidence illustrates the potential influence of prolonged high variability on the origin and spread of critical adaptations and lineages in the evolution of Homo.

When active, the faults created minor topographic relief. The upthrown fault footwalls accumulated assemblages with relatively high densities of artifacts, including types retaining potential usefulness, particularly volcanic flaked pieces, manuports, pounded pieces, and split cobbles. Values for these assemblage characteristics decline toward the lower-lying hangingwall of the fault compartments, accompanied by an increase in the proportionate weight of artifact assemblages comprising quartzite, particularly flaking shatter and potentially useful detached pieces. Values reverse once again at faults, either on the downthrown, hangingwall side or on the upthrown side. The patterns are stronger for the volcanic components of the artifact assemblages than for the quartzite components, reflecting the additional influence of distance from the local source on quartzite assemblage characteristics reported previously. The landscape distributions of artifact assemblages are consistent with a landscape-fault model in which minor fault-induced topographic relief at times created a mosaic of vegetation environments repeated within each of the three fault compartments of the lake margin and distal alluvial fan. The fault-compartmentalized landscape model is currently supported only by sediment thickness and facies changes across synsedimentary faults, but it provides predictions for spatial variation in the cover abundance of trees, freshwater reservoirs and associated distributions of resources and hazards associated with stone artifact use and discard that can be tested if sample sizes of key paleoenvironmental indicators are increased. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Hominin land use; Landscape paleoanthropology; Olduvai Gorge","artifact; fault; footwall; hominid; landscape; paleoenvironment; sediment thickness; spatial variation; topography; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864551602

Levallois technology remains an important focus for research in Palaeolithic archaeology, yet quantitative morphological comparisons of Levallois core morphology from different regions remain rare. Here, utilizing Levallois cores from Africa, the Near East, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent, patterns of morphological variability in the shape of the Levallois flaking surface and core outline (margin) shape were examined for patterns of variability and stability across regions using 3D geometric morphometrics. The multivariate statistical shape analyses undertaken revealed a clear pattern: that is, the greatest levels of shape variability in Levallois cores is evident in the form of their outline (planform) shape. Conversely, the geometrical relationship between the margin of the Levallois cores and their topological surface morphology was relatively uniform. This pattern of variability was evident in terms of variation both across regions and between cores from the same locality. These results indicate that the outline form of such cores was a less important variable than the geometric/topological properties of the surface morphology and, in particular, the relationship between the margin of the core and those variables. These results have implications for why it has been reported that replicating such cores in modern experiments is a particularly difficult task. The specific interrelationship between the geometric properties of the core and the core margin provide further evidence that Levallois core technology would be unlikely to emerge from the context of opportunistic migrating platform reduction strategies (such as those seen in many Mode 1 industries). If, as is widely suggested, Levallois cores were deliberate products in Pleistocene contexts, these results also hint that relatively sophisticated means of social transmission (i.e. teaching) may have been required to sustain their production over time and space. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Core variation; Geometric morphometric analysis; Levallois","archaeological evidence; archaeology; geometry; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; technological development; Africa; Europe; India",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871442389

At Gesher Benot Ya'aqov (GBY), a similar group of artifacts, named here ""massive scrapers,"" was identified as a significant component of the lithic assemblage. In this paper, we define and describe this Acheulean tool type and discuss its size, morphology, and technology. We demonstrate that at GBY these tools were shaped on flakes that were side-products of the reduction sequence to produce bifaces (handaxes and cleavers). We hypothesize that these blanks were rejected as potential bifaces during the knapping sequence but considered suitable for the retouching of massive scrapers, and were set aside for future work. We support our view with data from archaeological finds younger than those of GBY, as well as with evidence from controlled experimental knapping and ethnoarchaeological observations. We then discuss the contribution of this elaborate knapping strategy to our understanding of Lower Paleolithic hominin behavior, particularly in the domains of multifaceted planning and foresight. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The size and shape of our ancestors' anatomical features have long been the focus of research on hominin systematics, phylogeny, functional morphology, ontogeny, variation, and evolutionary change. Early physical anthropologists relied on both qualitative descriptions of anatomical shape and linear measurements to assess variation among hominins. The seminal works of W. W. Howells1 and C. E. Oxnard2 helped to bring multivariate techniques to the forefront of physical anthropology. Howells' intention was the objective delineation of components of shape, which could then fuel further analyses and interpretations, as well as clarification of the ways that growth influences interindividual and interpopulational differences in shape. He expressed concern that previous comparisons of individual measurements did not capture the overall shape of the skull, which is ""expressed by the relations between measurements."" 1:3 Similarly, Oxnard recognized that a multivariate approach to the study of complex shapes allows ""for such perturbations (e.g., variation and covariation)...that are difficult to evaluate by eye and impossible to reveal by measurement and simple analysis alone."" 2:6 While multivariate methods offered clear advantages over univariate or bivariate representations of shape, the analysis of traditional morphometric measures such as linear distances, angles, and ratios, has limitations when it comes to quantifying the complex geometry of some anatomical structures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Allometry; Integration; Modularity; Paleoanthropology; Shape analysis; Systematics","algorithm; article; cephalometry; evolution; histology; human; methodology; morphometrics; multivariate analysis; paleontology; phylogeny; skull; Algorithms; Biological Evolution; Body Weights and Measures; Cephalometry; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Paleontology; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865331150

Despite evidence that walking on two feet dates back 6-7 Ma, reconstructing hominin gait evolution is complicated by a sparse fossil record and challenges in inferring biomechanical patterns from isolated and fragmentary bones. Similarly, patterns of social behavior that distinguish modern humans from other living primates likely played significant roles in our evolution, but it is exceedingly difficult to understand the social behaviors of fossil hominins directly from fossil data. Footprints preserve direct records of gait biomechanics and behavior but they have been rare in the early human fossil record. Here we present analyses of an unprecedented discovery of 1.5-million-year-old footprint assemblages, produced by 20+ Homo erectus individuals. These footprints provide the oldest direct evidence for modern human-like weight transfer and confirm the presence of an energy-saving longitudinally arched foot in H. erectus. Further, print size analyses suggest that these H. erectus individuals lived and moved in cooperative multi-male groups, offering direct evidence consistent with human-like social behaviors in H. erectus.",,"biomechanics; clinical article; energy conservation; foot; fossil; gait; human; information processing; male; social behavior; anatomy and histology; animal; body size; evolution; fossil; gait; hominid; locomotion; physiology; walking; Animals; Biological Evolution; Biomechanical Phenomena; Body Size; Foot; Fossils; Gait; Hominidae; Humans; Locomotion; Social Behavior; Walking",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978426303

Over several decades comparisons of Soanian assemblages have been made with the non-bifacial industries of East Asia and north-west Europe. The chronological status and typo-technological relationship(s) of the Soanian to other Palaeolithic industries have been the subject of much debate. When first named and described the Soanian was considered to contain evidence of Mode 3 Levallois-style core reduction. However, in recent years, the potential Mode 3 component of the Soanian has largely been ignored, and the techno-complex is described under various guises as a core/flake or 'Mode 1' techno-complex. Here, a comparative morphometric assessment of selected Soanian cores and other Palaeolithic nuclei is undertaken, to test the hypothesis that this industry contains a definite Mode 3 Levallois element. Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) of morphometric variables provide robust evidence that at least part of the Soanian techno-complex contains Mode 3 Levallois cores. The implications of these analyses for the relationship between the Soanian and the Acheulean, and the relevance of the Soanian in considerations of the Movius Line are also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The Nachukui Formation of the Turkana Basin in northern Kenya, containing Oldowan and Acheulean tool assemblages and fossil evidence for early members of Homo and Paranthropus, provides an extensive spatial and temporal paleosol record of early Pleistocene savanna flora. Here we present new carbon isotopic (δ13CVPDB) values of pedogenic carbonates (68 nodules, 193 analyses) from the Nachukui Formation in order to characterize past vegetation structure and change through time. We compared three members (Kalochoro, Kaitio, and Natoo) at five locations spanning 2.4-1.4Ma and sampled in proximity to hominin archaeological and paleontological sites. Our results indicate diverse habitats showing a mosaic pattern of vegetation cover at each location yet demonstrate grassland expansion through time influenced by paleogeography. Kalochoro floodplains occurred adjacent to large river systems, and paleosols show evidence of C3 woodlands averaging 46-50% woody cover. Kaitio habitats were located along smaller rivers and lake margins. Paleosols yielded evidence for reduced portions of woody vegetation averaging 34-37% woody cover. Natoo environments had the highest percentage of grasslands averaging 21% woody cover near a diminishing Lake Turkana precursor. We also compared paleosol δ13CVPDB values of lithic archaeological sites with paleosol δ13CVPDB values of all environments available to hominins at 2.4-1.4Ma in the Nachukui and Koobi Fora Formations. Grassy environments became more widespread during this interval; woody canopy cover mean percentages steadily decreased by 12%. However, significantly more wooded savanna habitats were present in the vicinity of lithic archaeological sites and did not mirror the basin-wide trend of grassland spread. Hominin lithic archaeological sites consistently demonstrated woody cover circa 40% throughout our study interval and were 4-12% more woody than coeval basin environs. We propose that Turkana Basin early tool makers may have preferred a more wooded portion of the savanna ecosystem to reduce heat stress and to gain differential access to potable water, raw materials, animal carcasses, and edible plants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon isotopes; Paleolithic archaeological sites; Pleistocene East Africa; Savanna environments","archaeological evidence; carbon isotope; carbonate rock; fossil assemblage; habitat selection; hominid; Paleolithic; paleosol; pedogenesis; Pleistocene; savanna; stable isotope; Turkana Basin; Animalia; Paranthropus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879149656

Very rich lithic and faunal remains in a fluviatile sedimentary context indicate hominid activity on a sandy bar next to a river, which was perhaps perennial. Microstratigraphy and archaeological data permit reconstruction of the processes by which the remains were deposited. Several in situ occupation layers show only a slight degree of perturbation. The bone assemblage is of anthropic origin, and the lithic industry is characterized by an abundance of bifacial pieces, level VI being particularly rich in cleavers. From the analysis of the lithic industry we can obtain some idea of hominid technological behaviour, most notably the operational chains of tool production from the procurement of raw materials to the knapping sequences. The fauna associated with the lithic materials is dominated by animals of the open savanna (Alcelaphini and Antilopini); and its detailed study will allow us to specify the strategies used in the procurement of game and its subsequent consumption. Without doubt, the reasons for hominid occupation at this particular site will be impossible to explain fully. However, choice of this location, where evidence for several different activities has been uncovered, should be considered in terms of the proximity both of water and of outcrops of phonolite, the principal raw material for tool-making. Repeated occupation by hominids over a short time may, perhaps, correspond to the periodicity of their subsistence behaviour. © 1988 Cambridge University Press.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008223457

The least complicated hypothesis is that they were intended to arm hunting weapons. It has also been argued that they were produced for use in rituals or in connection with costly signaling displays. Lastly, it has been suggested that some cached Clovis points may have been used as saws. Here we report a study in which we morphometrically compared Clovis points from caches with Clovis points recovered from kill and camp sites to test two predictions of the hypothesis that cached Clovis points were intended to arm hunting weapons: 1) cached points should be the same shape as, but generally larger than, points from kill/camp sites, and 2) cached points and points from kill/camp sites should follow the same allometric trajectory. The results of the analyses are consistent with both predictions and therefore support the hypothesis. A follow-up review of the fit between the results of the analyses and the predictions of the other hypotheses indicates that the analyses support only the hunting equipment hypothesis. We conclude from this that cached Clovis points were likely produced with the intention of using them to arm hunting weapons. © 2012 Buchanan et al.",,"allometry; animal hunting; archeology; data base; geographic distribution; human; morphometrics; principal component analysis; review; simulation; weapon; archeology; article; artifact; methodology; United States; weapon; Archaeology; Artifacts; Humans; Southwestern United States; Weapons",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856795784

Work in West Turkana and Gona research areas suggests that Pliocene hominins had a concise understanding of stone fracture mechanics and had a clear conception of how to reduce cores in a manner that maintained flaking surfaces. Here we investigate if these same patterns existed at the Pliocene site of Kanjera South in Western Kenya. Technological analyses suggest that although many of the technological capabilities described for other Oldowan sites are present in the Kanjera South assemblage, specific aspects of the context of the site (raw material variability) produced a different expression of these behaviors. The most obvious difference between the Kanjera South site and other Oldowan sites is that as reduction continues several different reduction patterns can be seen. This suggests that a reduction sequence or core reduction mode is not an immutable formula and can change depending on its context. © 2009, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Oldowan; Raw Materials; Stone tools; Technology",,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922979952

The Technological Flake Category system [Toth, N., 1985. Oldowan reassessed: a close look at early stone artifacts, Journal of Archaeological Science 12, pp. 101-120] has been used extensively to infer the relative intensity of lithic reduction within Oldowan assemblages. Here we use a large experimental sample to test the relationship between a flake's stage in a reduction sequence and various quantitative attributes. We demonstrate how many previously described attributes are affected by initial core size. We then develop a multiple linear regression model that incorporates several variables to predict the placement of a flake within a generalized reduction sequence. The model is then applied to Oldowan assemblages in the Koobi Fora Formation which explores the strengths and weaknesses of different methods of investigating reduction intensity on an assemblage level. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of our understanding derives from a few localities in eastern Africa. Consequently, we know very little about hominin landscape use outside this region, despite the fact that mid-Pleistocene hominins occupied other climatic zones including temperate, and mid-latitude ecosystems. The winter rainfall zone in South Africa represents one of the world's most diverse ecosystems. Although mammal diversity is relatively low in these habitats this is compensated by the tremendous floral diversity. Buried Pleistocene land surfaces in the region provide an opportunity to understand how humans adapted to this unique, mid-latitude environment prior to the Last Interglacial. The dunefield locality of Elandsfontein in the Western Cape of South Africa is one of the richest known paleontological and archeological sites in southern Africa. It records details of landscape formation history, enabling detailed reconstruction of the ancient environments in this winter rainfall-dominated region. This dunefield archive allows us to posit the taphonomic history of newly excavated archaeological material and previously collected specimens. Here we provide initial results from the excavation and geological analysis of the Elandsfontein dunefield and provide new insights into the formation history of the archaeological and paleontological deposits.

Thus, exploring variability on the original designs can be informative of cultural adaptive processes on past populations. However, the complex life-cycle of a stone tool includes loops of damage due to use followed by breakage and resharpening that dramatically blur the size and shape attributes defining the original design. Here we use the Factor Model, a statistical approach recently modified to be used in landmark data, to evaluate original design attributes versus changes attributed to maintenance activities on a sample of Southern Patagonia lithic stemmed points, including arrows and spears. The model enables the separation of shape aspects that tend to covary because of common factors affecting simultaneously the two fundamental modules of a classical stemmed weapon (blade/stem), from those shape features explained only by local factors affecting modules independently. Our results show that original design differences explain most of the total shape variation, and also indicate that maintenance patterns differ among point types considered as different weapon systems (arrows and spears). Whereas arrow reduction is focused on tip modifications, spears present a broader array of shape changes including the tip and the shoulders. These results demonstrate that disentangling the sophisticated interaction among original design and maintenance activities of lithic projectile points enables a proper and independent exploration of adaptation to functional demands and cognitive models of past populations.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Factor model; Geometric morphometrics; Lithic projectile points; Shape variation","factor analysis; lithic fragment; modeling; morphometry; tool use; design; geometry; numerical model; shape; statistical analysis; weapon; Patagonia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884376430

For Clovis peoples, the earliest well-documented North Americans, resharpening is believed to have been particularly important because foraging territories were unknown or poorly known. Gardner (1983, Archaeol East N Amer 11, 49-64) proposed a spatial model of Clovis point resharpening wherein the effects of resharpening increase with distance from stone outcrop. Here we report a study that quantitatively assesses Gardner's model using a large sample of Clovis points from three high-quality chert sources in the Midwest. To investigate the predictions of the model, we used least-cost pathway distances from outcrop locations to each Clovis point and three measures of point resharpening. Our expectations, derived from the model, are that as distance from outcrop increases, points should show evidence of increased resharpening and therefore be smaller in size; should deviate from the classic shape; and should exhibit greater outer-to-inner flake-scar ratios. Our results indicate that there is no spatial patterning of these three measures of point resharpening and therefore do not support Gardner's model. Further analyses suggest that resharpening was not a significant source of Clovis-point variation at the population level and that Clovis points in the Midwest may not have served as the long-life tools as has been generally assumed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Clovis; Flake-scar pattern; Geometric morphometrics; Great Lakes; Least-cost pathway; Resharpening",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929612436

We report new geological data concerning the outlet channel of the Omo River between earliest Pliocene and final closure of the Turkana Basin drainage system in the latest Pliocene to earliest Quaternary. Throughout most of the Pliocene the Omo River entered the Turkana Basin from its source in the highlands of Ethiopia and exited the eastern margin of the basin to discharge into the Lamu embayment along the coast of the Indian Ocean. During the earliest Pliocene the river's outlet was located in the northern part of the basin, where a remnant outlet channel is preserved in basalts that pre-date eruption of the Gombe flood basalt between 4.05 and 3.95. Ma. The outlet channel was faulted down to the west prior to 4.05. Ma, forming a natural dam behind which Lake Lonyumun developed. Lake Lonyumun was drained between 3.95 and 3.9. Ma when a new outlet channel formed north of Loiyangalani in the southeastern margin of the Turkana Basin. That outlet was blocked by Lenderit Basalt lava flows between 2.2 and 2.0. Ma. Faulting that initiated either during or shortly after eruption of the Lenderit Basalt closed the depression that is occupied by modern Lake Turkana to sediment and water.Several large shield volcanoes formed east of the Turkana Basin beginning by 2.5-3.0. Ma, volcanism overlapping in time, but probably migrating eastward from Mount Kulal on the eastern edge of the basin to Mount Marsabit located at the eastern edge of the Chalbi Desert. The mass of the volcanic rocks loaded and depressed the lithosphere, enhancing subsidence in a shallow southeast trending depression that overlay the Cretaceous and Paleogene (?) Anza Rift. Subsidence in this flexural depression guided the course of the Omo River towards the Indian Ocean, and also localized accumulations of lava along the margins of the shield volcanoes. Lava flows at Mount Marsabit extended across the Omo River Valley after 1.8-2.0. Ma based on estimated ages of fossils in lacustrine and terrestrial deposits, and possibly by as early as 2.5 ± 0.3. Ma based on dating of a lava flow. During the enhanced precipitation in latest Pleistocene and earliest Holocene (11-9.5. ka) this flexural depression became the site of Lake Chalbi, which was separated from Lake Turkana by a tectonically controlled drainage divide. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Gombe Basalt; Kenya; Omo Group; Omo River; Tectonics; Turkana Basin","basin evolution; Cretaceous; drainage basin; faulting; flood basalt; lava flow; Paleogene; paleogeography; Pliocene; structural control; subsidence; tectonic setting; volcanism; volcano; Coast Province; Eastern Province [Kenya]; Ethiopia; Indian Ocean; Kenya; Lamu; Marsabit; Omo River; Turkana Basin",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78951472872

In particular there is contention as to whether or not Acheulean handaxes were resharpened. Here we test the flake scar density index (SDI), calculated using 3D laser scans of bifaces, as a measure of handaxe reduction. We experimentally reduced an assemblage of 57 handaxes tracking changes in their SDI and mass lost at each stage of reduction. We tested the effects of blank type, coarseness of the stone, and different protocols for reduction. Our results show that the SDI is indeed an effective measure of mass lost, although it is influenced by the blank type of the handaxe.We applied the SDI to two archaeological assemblages of Acheulean bifaces from East Africa: Kariandusi and Isenya; and two archaeological assemblages from India: Patpara and Bhimbetka. Exotic materials were more reduced at Kariandusi and Isenya. A relationship between SDI and volume, such that smaller handaxes have higher scar densities, and are thus likely small because they have been reduced more, suggests resharpening. Conversely, the lack of such a relationship may be taken as evidence that bifaces were not resharpened. Our results show that exotic handaxes from Kariandusi, local handaxes from Isenya, and bifaces in general from Patpara were resharpened. On the other hand neither local handaxes from Kariandusi, cleavers from Isenya, nor cleavers from Bhimbetka, were resharpened. The unretouched bit formed by the termination of the original flake blank on the Isenya and Bhimbetka cleavers provides independent evidence for the lack of resharpening. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Acheulean; Biface; Reduction intensity; Resharpening; Scar density index",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922963185

The cultural meaning of these tools, especially with respect to their geographic and chronological patterning has been debated for a long time, with unifacial and bifacial tools treated as fundamentally different technical systems. This paper builds upon previous work that showed that unifacial and bifacial blanks often follow similar reduction trajectories, and compares the management of edge angles in both of these tool classes using a large sample representing the Mousterian of Acheulian Tradition (MTA), the Quina Mousterian, the Keilmessergruppen, and the Crimean Micoquian technocomplexes. The results show that a) unifacial reduction results in the unequivocal increase in edge angles and b) that plano-convex bifacial reduction in the Central and Eastern European Micoquian, as well as similar techniques in the Quina Mousterian serve the same purpose of reducing and maintaining edge angles within certain limits; finally, c) MTA biconvex reduction results in a slow increase in edge angles. The process of edge angle reduction can be used to explain morphology and technology of the different pieces. Given that all these reduction techniques were part of the Neandertal technical repertoire for long periods of time, disappearing and reappearing at various points in history, the implication is that any geographical patterning may be due not to culture-historical developments, but rather to medium-to long-term adaptations to local environments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","Keilmessergruppen; Mousterian of Acheulian Tradition; Neandertal behavior; Quina Mousterian; Regionality; Technical repertoire","adaptation; human behavior; Neanderthal; Paleolithic; technological change; tool use; Central Europe; Eastern Europe; Antirhea",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027958147

Since these physical properties are integrated to accomplish that function, examining design variables and their pattern of integration or modularity is of interest to estimate the past function of a point. Here we analyze a composite sample of lithic points from southern Patagonia likely formed by arrows, thrown spears and hand-held points to test if they can be viewed as a two-module system formed by the blade and the stem, and to evaluate the degree in which shape, size, asymmetry, blade: stem length ratio, and tip angle explain the observed variance and differentiation among points supposedly aimed to accomplish different functions. To do so we performed a geometric morphometric analysis on 118 lithic points, departing from 24 two-dimensional landmark and semi landmarks placed on the point's contour. Klingenberg's covariational modularity tests were used to evaluate different modularity hypotheses, and a composite PCA including shape, size, asymmetry, blade: stem length ratio, and tip angle was used to estimate the importance of each attribute to explaining variation patterns. Results show that the blade and the stem can be seen as ""near decomposable units"" in the points integrating the studied sample. However, this modular pattern changes after removing the effects of reduction. Indeed, a resharpened point tends to show a tip/rest of the point modular pattern. The composite PCA analyses evidenced three different patterns of morphometric attributes compatible with arrows, thrown spears, and hand-held tools. Interestingly, when analyzed independently, these groups show differences in their modular organization.

These sources are modern children's development, ethnography of non-Western societies, biological commonalities among hominids, and behavior of modern nonhuman primates. Given a prior argument that the key to understanding the nature of modern human behavior is the emergence of language (itself claimed as a form of behavior), we identify as a problem the matter of whether language is present or absent in the analogues that may be chosen as sources of knowledge for making inferences about that record. Our own speculative argument about the emergence of modern human behavior stresses the capacity for imitation, the need for sufficient biological capacities, the making of signs whose referential function can be discovered, the transformations in perception and communication that result, and the evolution of these capacities through their selection from the extreme of a range of variation. The interpretation of the archaeological record which this permits does not violate the methodological principles we espouse, although we identify a further methodological problem in how to approach different kinds of visible signs, remaining as traces in that record. We conclude with a brief, further argument about the selective advantage linguistic behavior confers. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344968006

Although represented in only a handful of sites, the Still Bay is widespread geographically and, at certain localities, persisted over a substantial period of time. Many studies have focused on tracing the temporal range and geographic reach of the Still Bay, as well as inferring degrees of early modern human demographic connectedness from these parameters. Variation within the Still Bay, relative to the accuracy with which it can be identified, has received considerably less attention. However, demographic models based on the spread of the Still Bay in space and time hinge on the reliability with which it can be recognized in the archaeological record. Here we document patterns of bifacial point shape and size variation in some key Still Bay assemblages, and analyse these patterns using the statistical shape analysis tools of geometric morphometrics. Morphological variation appears to be geographically structured and is driven by the spatial separation between north-eastern and south-western clusters of sites. We argue that allometric variation is labile and reflects environmentally driven differences in point reduction, whereas shape differences unrelated to size more closely reflect technological and cultural fragmentation. Our results suggest that the biogeographic structure of Middle Stone Age populations was complex during the period associated with the Still Bay, and provide little support for heightened levels of cultural interconnectedness between distantly separated groups at this time. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for tracing classic techno-traditions in the Middle Stone Age record of southern Africa, and for inferring underpinning population dynamics from these patterns. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bifacial points; Cultural connectedness and fragmentation; Geographic variation; Geometric morphometrics; Modern human demography; Techno-traditions","archaeology; biogeography; demography; geographical variation; Mesolithic; morphometry; shape analysis; South Africa; Still Bay; Western Cape; archeology; evolution; human; population dynamics; South Africa; technology; Archaeology; Biological Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; South Africa; Technology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974593556

The most comprehensive sequences are found in East Africa, where, in largescale syntheses, the Lower Pleistocene Acheulean (LPA) has often been considered a uniform cultural entity. Furthermore, the emergence and development of Acheulean technology are seen as linked to the emergence and evolution of Homo ergaster/erectus. The criterion for grouping together different lithic assemblages scattered over space and time is the presence of large cutting tools (LCTs), more than of any other component. Their degree of refinement has been used, in turn, as a parameter for evaluating Acheulean development and variability. But was the East African LPA really uniform as regards all components involved in lithic productions? The aim of this paper is to evaluate the techno-economic similarities and differences among LPA productions in a specific micro-regional and environmental context, i.e. at Melka Kunture, in the Ethiopian highlands, and in a specific period of time: between ~1.5 Ma, when some of the earliest Acheulean complexes appeared, and 1.0-0.85 Ma, when LCTs productions became intensive and widespread. Our detailed comparative analyses investigate all aspects and phases of the chaînes opératoires. Since hominin fossil remains were discovered at some of the analyzed sites, we also discuss differences among lithic productions in relation to the changing paleoanthropological record. Our studies show that at Melka Kunture the LPA techno-complexes cannot be grouped into a single uniform entity. The assembled evidence points instead to “two Acheuleans” well-defined by a strong discontinuity in various aspects of techno-economic behaviors. This discontinuity is related to a major step in human evolution: the transition from Homo ergaster/ erectus to Homo heidelbergensis. © 2017, Istituto Italiano di Antropologia.

It remains, however, unclear to date if handaxes arrived in Europe as a fully developed technology or if they evolved locally from core-And-flake industries. This issue is also linked with another long-standing debate on the existence and behavioral, cognitive, and social meaning of a possibly chronological trend for increased handaxe symmetry throughout the Lower Paleolithic. The newly discovered sites can provide a link between the much older Acheulian in Africa and the Levant and the well-known assemblages from the later European Acheulian, enabling a rigorous testing of these hypotheses using modern morphometric methods. Here we use the Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) method to quantify handaxe symmetry at la Noira, a newly excavated site in central France, which features two archaeological levels, respectively ca. 700 ka and 500 ka old. In order to provide a context for the new data, we use a large aggregate from the well-known 500 ka old site of Boxgrove, England. We show that handaxes from the oldest layer at la Noira, although on average less symmetric than both those from the younger layers at the same site and than those from Boxgrove, are nevertheless much more symmetric than other early Acheulian specimens evaluated using the CSM method. We also correlate trends in symmetry to degree of reduction, demonstrating that raw material availability and discard patterns may affect observed symmetry values. We conclude that it is likely that, by the time the Acheulian arrived in Europe, its makers were, from a cognitive and motor-control point of view, already capable of producing the symmetric variant of this technology. © 2017 Grelet et al.

This effort, however, has been challenging due to the discontinuous nature of paleoecological data spanning many important periods in hominin evolution. Sediments from the Upper Burgi (1.98–1.87 Ma), KBS (1.87–1.56 Ma) and Okote (1.56–1.38 Ma) members of the Koobi Fora Formation at East Turkana in northern Kenya document an important time interval in the evolutionary history of the hominin genera Homo and Paranthropus. Although much attention has been paid to Upper Burgi and KBS member deposits, far less is known regarding the East Turkana paleoecosystem during Okote Member times. This study pairs spatially-resolved faunal abundance data with stable isotope geochemistry from mammalian enamel to investigate landscape-scale ecosystem variability during Okote Member times. We find that during this period 1) taxa within the East Turkana large mammal community were distributed heterogeneously across space, 2) the abundance of C3 and C4 vegetation varied between East Turkana subregions, and 3) the Karari subregion, an area with abundant evidence of hominin stone tool manufacture, had significantly more C3 vegetation than regions closer to the central axis of the Turkana Basin (i.e., Ileret and Koobi Fora). These findings indicate that the East Turkana paleoecosystem during the Okote Member was highly variable across space and provided a complex adaptive landscape for Pleistocene hominins. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon isotope; Hominin; Oxygen isotope; Paleoecology; Paleovegetation","adaptation; carbon isotope; heterogeneity; hominid; human evolution; oxygen isotope; paleoecology; Pleistocene; tool use; vegetation structure; Kenya; Turkana; Mammalia; Paranthropus; analysis; animal; biodiversity; classification; ecosystem; evolution; fossil; hominid; Kenya; mammal; plant; sediment; Animals; Biodiversity; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Fossils; Geologic Sediments; Hominidae; Kenya; Mammals; Plants",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026292304

We investigate systematic variation between two technological groups of flakes using experimentally produced assemblages, and then apply the experimental model to the Cutting 10 Mid -Pleistocene archaeological collection from Elandsfontein, South Africa. We argue that a specific set of independent variables - and their interactions - including external platform angle, platform depth, measures of thickness variance and flake curvature should distinguish between these two technological groups. The role of these variables in technological group separation was further investigated using the Generalized Linear Model as well as Linear Discriminant Analysis. The Discriminant model was used to classify archaeological flakes from the Cutting 10 locality in terms of their probability of association, within either experimentally developed technological group. The results indicate that the selected independent variables play a central role in separating core and flake from bifacial technologies. Thickness evenness and curvature had the greatest effect sizes in both the Generalized Linear and Discriminant models. Interestingly the interaction between thickness evenness and platform depth was significant and played an important role in influencing technological group membership. The identified interaction emphasizes the complexity in attempting to distinguish flake production strategies based on flake morphological attributes. The results of the discriminant function analysis demonstrate that the majority of flakes at the Cutting 10 locality were not associated with the production of the numerous Large Cutting Tools found at the site, which corresponds with previous suggestions regarding technological behaviors reflected in this assemblage. © 2015 Presnyakova et al.

Given the separate history of these developments, in this paper we integrate the latest achievements in the four key Acheulean regions in China (namely, Dingcun, Bose, Luonan and Danjiangkou Reservoir Region). Based on this, and combined with our own observations of materials from these four regions, we summarize what is currently known about the Chinese Acheulean and propose those questions that are still awaiting resolution. Finally, we consider five arguments that are highly relevant to the origins of the Acheulean techno-complex in China. From this synthesis, we suggest that the technological transmission hypothesis might be a suitable explanation for the emergence of Chinese handaxe technology, and we provide supporting data for the migration of Acheulean hominids from west to east in the Early Palaeolithic period. © 2015 Académie des sciences","Acheulean techno-complex; China; Handaxes; Hominid dispersals; Migration hypothesis","Acheulean; dispersal; dispersion; hominid; hypothesis testing; migration; Paleolithic; China; Hominidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955313762
