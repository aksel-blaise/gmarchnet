The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units (OTUs [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of OTUs starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.",,"animal; article; biological model; biometry; evolution; frog; genetics; phylogeny; Animals; Biometry; Evolution; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Ranidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023375195

Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n −1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal trans form to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the ease of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed. © 1967, American Association for Cancer Research.

The objective of this report is to provide a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of the Pleistocene when sea levels were below present day levels. Location: The maps presented here cover tropical Southeast Asia and Austral-Asia. The east-west coverage extends 8000 km from Australia to Sri Lanka. The north-south coverage extends 5000 km from Taiwan to Australia. Methods: Present-day bathymetric depth contours were used to estimate past shore lines and the locations of the major drowned river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves. The timing of sea level changes associated with glaciation over the past 250,000 years was taken from multiple sources that, in some cases, account for tectonic uplift and subsidence during the period in question. Results: This report provides a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of 17,000, 150,000 and 250,000 years before present. The ancient shorelines are based on present day depth contours of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 120 m. On the maps depicting shorelines at 75, 100 and 120 m below present levels the major Pleistocene river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves are depicted. Estimates of the number of major sea level fluctuation events and the duration of time that sea levels were at or below the illustrated level are provided. Main conclusions: Previous reconstructions of sea-level change during the Pleistocene have emphasized the maximum lows. The perspective provided here emphasizes that sea levels were at their maximum lows for relatively short periods of time but were at or below intermediate levels (e.g. at or below 40 m below present-day levels) for more than half of each of the time periods considered.","Biogeography; Maps; Palaeogeography; Pleistocene; Sea levels; Southeast Asia","deglaciation; glaciation; Pleistocene; river system; sea level change; shoreline change; timescale; Asia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034492377

Here we find a linear relationship between genetic and geographic distance in a worldwide sample of human populations, with major deviations from the fitted line explicable by admixture or extreme isolation. A close relationship is shown to exist between the correlation of geographic distance and genetic differentiation (as measured by FST) and the geographic pattern of heterozygosity across populations. Considering a worldwide set of geographic locations as possible sources of the human expansion, we find that heterozygosities in the globally distributed populations of the data set are best explained by an expansion originating in Africa and that no geographic origin outside of Africa accounts as well for the observed patterns of genetic diversity. Although the relationship between F ST and geographic distance has been interpreted in the past as the result of an equilibrium model of drift and dispersal, simulation shows that the geographic pattern of heterozygosities in this data set is consistent with a model of a serial founder effect starting at a single origin. Given this serial-founder scenario, the relationship between genetic and geographic distance allows us to derive bounds for the effects of drift and natural selection on human genetic variation. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Genetic distance; Genetic drift; HGDP-CEPH; Human origins; Microsatellites","Africa; article; biodiversity; computer prediction; correlation analysis; founder effect; gene isolation; genetic distance; genetic linkage; geographic distribution; heterozygosity; human; major clinical study; mathematical analysis; natural selection; population genetics; priority journal; Africa; Founder Effect; Genetic Drift; Genetic Heterogeneity; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Models, Genetic; Selection (Genetics); Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-27644509150

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","Asymmetry; Form space; Kendall shape space; Procrustes; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69449097227

The combination of primitive and derived features assigns this hominin to a new species, Homo floresiensis. The most likely explanation for its existence on Flores is long-term isolation, with subsequent endemic dwarfing, of an ancestral H. erectus population.

In this study, samples of modern and prehistoric hunter–gatherers and agriculturalists are used to test the hypothesis that there are systematic differences in patterns of tooth wear related to major differences in subsistence and food preparation. Flatness of molar wear is compared for five groups of hunter–gatherers (N = 298) and five groups of early agriculturalists (N = 365). Hunter–gatherers are predicted to develop flatter molar wear due to the mastication of tough and fibrous foods, whereas agriculturalists should develop oblique molar wear due to an increase in the proportion of ground and prepared food in the diet. A method is presented for the quantitative measurement and analysis of flatness of molar wear. Comparisons of wear plane angle are made between teeth matched for the same stage of occlusal surface wear, thus standardizing all groups to the same rate of wear. Agriculturalists develop highly angled occlusal wear planes on the entire molar dentition. Their wear plane angles tend to exceed hunter–gatherers by about 10° in advanced wear. Wear plane angles are similar within subsistence divisions despite regional differences in particular foods.

The estimates are earth-model dependent and parameters are chosen that minimize discrepancies between the individual estimates for each region. Good coherence between estimates from different localities has been found. The main conclusions are: (i) Ice volumes approached their maximum values 30 000 (calendar) years ago and remained nearly constant until 19 000 years ago. This defines the period of maximum global glaciation. (ii) The postLGM sea-level rise is marked by changes in rates with maximum rates of about 15 mm/year occurring from 16,000 to 12,500 years ago and again from 11,500 to 9000 years ago. Ice volumes in the interval between these two periods of rapid rise, corresponding to the Younger Dryas, is nearly constant. (iii) The melting at the end of the LGM is characterized by an initially high rate over about 500 years followed by about 2500 years of a comparatively slow increase in ocean volume. (iv) The lead into the LGM is characterized by a sea-level fall of about 50 m occurring within a few thousand years. Similar rates of falling and rising sea levels occur during the earlier part of the oxygen isotope stage 3 interval. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is one of the few appropriate tests when the hypothesis under study can only be formulated in terms of distances; this is often the case with genetic data. In particular, the Mantel test has been widely used to test for spatial relationship between genetic data and spatial layout of the sampling locations. We describe the domain of application of the Mantel test and derived forms. Formula development demonstrates that the sum-of-squares (SS) partitioned in Mantel tests and regression on distance matrices differs from the SS partitioned in linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis. Numerical simulations show that in tests of significance of the relationship between simple variables and multivariate data tables, the power of linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis is far greater than that of the Mantel test and derived forms, meaning that the former methods are much more likely than the latter to detect a relationship when one is present in the data. Examples of difference in power are given for the detection of spatial gradients. Furthermore, the Mantel test does not correctly estimate the proportion of the original data variation explained by spatial structures. The Mantel test should not be used as a general method for the investigation of linear relationships or spatial structures in univariate or multivariate data. Its use should be restricted to tests of hypotheses that can only be formulated in terms of distances. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Multiple regression; Numerical simulations; Permutation test; Power; Redundancy analysis; Spatial analysis; Type I error; Variation partitioning",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955765927

However, the central question of why in took these populations -100,000 years to disperse from Africa to other regions of tha world has never been clearly resolved. It is suggested here that the answer may lie partly in the results of recent DNA studies of present-day African populations, combined with a spate of new archaeological discoveries in Africa. Studies of both the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mismatch patterns in modern African populations and related mtDNA lineage-analysis patterns point to a major demographic expansion centered broadly within the time range from 80,000 to 60,000 B.P., probably deriving from a small geographical region of Africa. Recent archaeological discoveries in southern and eastern Africa suggest that, at approximately the same time, there was a major increase in the complexity of the technological, economic, social, and cognitive behavior of certain African groups, which could have led to a major demographic expansion of these groups in competition with other, adjacent groups. It is suggested that this complex of behavioral changes (possibly triggered by the rapid environmental changes around the transition from oxygen isotope stage 5 to stage 4) could have led not only to the expansion of the 12 and 13 mitochondrial lineages over the whole of Africa but also to the ensuing dispersal of these modern populations over most regions of Asia, Australasia, and Europe, and their replacement (with or without interbreeding) of the preceding ""archaic"" populations in these regions. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Archaeology; DNA; Modern humans; Palaeolithic","mitochondrial DNA; oxygen; Africa; archeology; Asia; Australia and New Zealand; cognition; demography; DNA determination; economics; environmental change; Europe; genetic linkage; human; mismatch repair; mitochondrion; model; paleoanthropology; population dispersal; priority journal; review; social behavior; technology",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745435794

Here we report a large-scale survey of autosomal variation from a broad geographic sample of Asian human populations. Our results show that genetic ancestry is strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations as well as geography. Most populations show relatedness within ethnic/linguistic groups, despite prevalent gene flow among populations. More than 90% of East Asian (EA) haplotypes could be found in either Southeast Asian (SEA) or Central-South Asian (CSA) populations and show clinal structure with haplotype diversity decreasing from south to north. Furthermore, 50% of EA haplotypes were found in SEA only and 5% were found in CSA only, indicating that SEA was a major geographic source of EA populations.",,"ancestry; cultural geography; ethnicity; genetic variation; relatedness; article; Asia; autosomal inheritance; biogeography; ethnic group; gene flow; gene mapping; genetic variability; haplotype; human; linguistics; population genetics; priority journal; South Asia; Southeast Asia; Algorithms; Asia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Gene Flow; Genotype; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Humans; Language; Linguistics; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; Asia; Eurasia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-72149083621

Hypotheses on the origin of the Austronesian settlers of the Pacific are divided between a recent ""pulse-pause"" expansion from Taiwan and an older ""slow-boat"" diffusion from Wallacea. We used lexical data and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to construct a phylogeny of 400 languages. In agreement with the pulse-pause scenario, the language trees place the Austronesian origin in Taiwan approximately 5230 years ago and reveal a series of settlement pauses and expansion pulses linked to technological and social innovations. These results are robust to assumptions about the rooting and calibration of the trees and demonstrate the combined power of linguistic scholarship, database technologies, and computational phylogenetic methods for resolving questions about human prehistory.",,"database; phylogenetics; phylogeny; population distribution; article; Bayes theorem; biodiversity; cultural anthropology; linguistics; Pacific islands; phylogeny; population dynamics; priority journal; Taiwan; Bayes Theorem; Databases, Factual; Emigration and Immigration; History, Ancient; Humans; Language; Linguistics; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Pacific Islands; Philippines; Phylogeny; Polynesia; Population Dynamics; Taiwan; Vocabulary; Gabaza",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-58849102142

Climatic Change 19, 53-61]. A minimal interpretation of the size of this corridor requires a narrow but continuous zone of open 'savanna' vegetation 50-150 km wide, running along the sand-covered divide between the modern South China and Java Seas. This area formed a land bridge between the Malaysian Peninsula and the major islands of Sumatra, Java and Borneo. The savanna corridor connected similar open vegetation types north and south of the equator, and served as a barrier to the dispersal of rainforest-dependent species between Sumatra and Borneo. A maximal interpretation of the available evidence is compatible with the existence of a broad savanna corridor, with forest restricted to refugia primarily in Sumatra, Borneo and the continental shelf beneath the modern South China Sea. This savanna corridor may have provided a convenient route for the rapid early dispersal of modern humans through the region and on into Australasia. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These genomes include at least 5.8 million base pairs that are not present in the human reference genome. Our analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human genome variation, including that the rate of accumulation of mutations has accelerated by about 5% in non-Africans compared to Africans since divergence. We show that the ancestors of some pairs of present-day human populations were substantially separated by 100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans; instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming from the same source as that of other non-Africans. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"ancestry; data set; divergence; genetic variation; genome; indigenous population; minority group; mutation; African; Andamanese; Article; ethnic group; gene mutation; genetic variability; genome; human; Indigenous Australian; Papua New Guinean; population dispersal; priority journal; ancestry group; animal; Australia; Black person; DNA sequence; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; history; Homo neanderthalensis; human genome; information processing; migration; mutation rate; Oceanic ancestry group; Papua New Guinea; phylogeny; population genetics; species difference; time factor; Africa; Andamans; Andamans and Nicobars; Australia; New Guinea; African Continental Ancestry Group; Animals; Australia; Continental Population Groups; Datasets as Topic; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Genomics; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Mutation Rate; Neanderthals; New Guinea; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Time Factors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991728057

However, only a sparse sampling of populations from Southeast Asia and Oceania were analyzed. Here, we quantify Denisova admixture in 33 additional populations from Asia and Oceania. Aboriginal Australians, Near Oceanians, Polynesians, Fijians, east Indonesians, and Mamanwa (a ""Negrito"" group from the Philippines) have all inherited genetic material from Denisovans, but mainland East Asians, western Indonesians, Jehai (a Negrito group from Malaysia), and Onge (a Negrito group from the Andaman Islands) have not. These results indicate that Denisova gene flow occurred into the common ancestors of New Guineans, Australians, and Mamanwa but not into the ancestors of the Jehai and Onge and suggest that relatives of present-day East Asians were not in Southeast Asia when the Denisova gene flow occurred. Our finding that descendants of the earliest inhabitants of Southeast Asia do not all harbor Denisova admixture is inconsistent with a history in which the Denisova interbreeding occurred in mainland Asia and then spread over Southeast Asia, leading to all its earliest modern human inhabitants. Instead, the data can be most parsimoniously explained if the Denisova gene flow occurred in Southeast Asia itself. Thus, archaic Denisovans must have lived over an extraordinarily broad geographic and ecological range, from Siberia to tropical Asia. © 2011 The American Society of Human Genetics.",,"article; Asia; Australia; Denisova; gene flow; genetic analysis; genome analysis; genotype; hominid; human; Pacific islands; Philippines; population genetics; population migration; priority journal; Russian Federation; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; Southeast Asia; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; Biological Evolution; DNA, Mitochondrial; Gene Flow; Genotype; Geography; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Genetic; Models, Statistical; Oceania; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Pan troglodytes; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053899093

This paper presents one such case study: Niah Cave in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, famous for the discovery in 1958 in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of a modern human skull, the 'Deep Skull,' controversially associated with radiocarbon dates of ca. 40,000 years before the present. A new chronostratigraphy has been developed through a re-investigation of the lithostratigraphy left by the earlier excavations, AMS-dating using three different comparative pre-treatments including ABOX of charcoal, and U-series using the Diffusion-Absorption model applied to fragments of bones from the Deep Skull itself. Stratigraphic reasons for earlier uncertainties about the antiquity of the skull are examined, and it is shown not to be an 'intrusive' artifact. It was probably excavated from fluvial-pond-desiccation deposits that accumulated episodically in a shallow basin immediately behind the cave entrance lip, in a climate that ranged from times of comparative aridity with complete desiccation, to episodes of greater surface wetness, changes attributed to regional climatic fluctuations. Vegetation outside the cave varied significantly over time, including wet lowland forest, montane forest, savannah, and grassland. The new dates and the lithostratigraphy relate the Deep Skull to evidence of episodes of human activity that range in date from ca. 46,000 to ca. 34,000 years ago. Initial investigations of sediment scorching, pollen, palynomorphs, phytoliths, plant macrofossils, and starch grains recovered from existing exposures, and of vertebrates from the current and the earlier excavations, suggest that human foraging during these times was marked by habitat-tailored hunting technologies, the collection and processing of toxic plants for consumption, and, perhaps, the use of fire at some forest-edges. The Niah evidence demonstrates the sophisticated nature of the subsistence behavior developed by modern humans to exploit the tropical environments that they encountered in Southeast Asia, including rainforest. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Some cranial regions, particularly the face and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because different cranial regions preserve population history and climate signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate adaptation; Craniofacial morphology; Human variation; Neutral genetics; Population history","accuracy; article; climate; correlation analysis; evolution; face; female; genetic distance; geometry; history; human; human tissue; hypothesis; male; morphology; morphometrics; normal human; phylogeny; population research; priority journal; reliability; skull; temporal bone; Acclimatization; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Climate; Continental Population Groups; Evolution; Face; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Temporal Bone; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845396793

Box 28147, San Antonio, TX 78284, United States","A major goal in anthropological genetics is the assessment of the effects of different microevolutionary forces. Harpending and Ward (1982) developed a model that aids in this effort by comparing observed and expected heterozygosity within populations in a local region. The expected heterozygosity within a population is a function of the total heterozygosity of the entire region and the distance of the population from the regional mean centroid of allele frequencies. Greater than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having greater heterozygosity than expected. Less than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having less heterozygosity than expected. We extend the Harpending-Ward model to quantitative traits using an equal and additive effects model of inheritance. Here the additive genetic variance within a population is directly proportional to heterozygosity, and its expectation is directly proportional to the genetic distance from the centroid. Under certain assumptions the expectations for phenotypic variances are similar. Observed and expected genetic or phenotypic variance can then be compared to assess the effects of differential external gene flow. When the additive genetic covariance matrix or heritabilities are not known, the phenotypic covariance matrix can be used to provide a conservative application of the model. In addition, we develop new methods for estimation of the genetic relationship matrix (R) from quantitative traits. We apply these models to two data sets: (1) six principal components derived from twenty dermatoglyphic ridge count measures for nine villages in Nepal and (2) ten anthropometric measurements for seven isolated populations in western Ireland. In both cases both the univariate and multivariate analyses provide results that can be directly interpreted in terms of historically known patterns of gene flow.",,"anthropometry; conference paper; heterozygosity; human; india; ireland; mathematical model; population research; quantitative assay; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Dermatoglyphics; Gene Frequency; Genetics, Population; Human; Models, Genetic; Nepal; Northern Ireland; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Variation (Genetics)",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025144359

Global genetic analyses have argued for one single origin, placed somewhere in Africa. This scenario implies a rapid expansion, with a series of bottlenecks of small amplitude, which would have led to the observed smooth loss of genetic diversity with increasing distance from Africa. Analyses of cranial data, on the other hand, have given mixed results, and have been argued to support multiple origins of modern humans. Using a large data set of skull measurements and an analytical framework equivalent to that used for genetic data, we show that the loss in genetic diversity has been mirrored by a loss in phenotypic variability. We find evidence for an African origin, placed somewhere in the central/southern part of the continent, which harbours the highest intra-population diversity in phenotypic measurements.

Problems in tree estimation have been seen as weakening the case for a replacement model and favoring a multiregional evolution model. There has been less discussion of patterns of within‐group variation, although the mtDNA evidence has consistently shown the greatest diversity within African populations. Problems of interpretation abound given the numerous factors that can influence within‐group variation, including the possibility of earlier divergence, differences in population size, patterns of population expansion, and variation in migration rates. We present a model of within‐group phenotypic variation and apply it to a large set of craniometric data representing major Old World geographic regions (57 measurements for 1,159 cases in four regions: Europe, Sub‐Saharan Africa, Australasia, and the Far East). The model predicts a linear relationship between variation within populations (the average within‐group variance) and variation between populations (the genetic distance of populations to pooled phenotypic means). On a global level this relationship should hold if the long‐term effective population sizes of each region are correctly specified. Other potential effects on withingroup variation are accounted for by the model. Comparison of observed and expected variances under the assumption of equal effective sizes for four regions indicates significantly greater within‐group variation in Africa and significantly less within‐group variation in Europe. These results suggest that the long‐term effective population size was greatest in Africa. Closer examination of the model suggests that the long‐term African effective size was roughly three times that of any other geographic region. Using these estimates of relative population size, we present a method for analyzing ancient population structure, which provides estimates of ancient migration. This method allows us to reconstruct migration history between geographic regions after adjustment for the effect of genetic drift on interpopulational distances. Our results show a clear isolation of Africa from other regions. We then present a method that allows direct estimation of the ancient migration matrix, thus providing us with information on the actual extent of interregional migration. These methods also provide estimates of time frames necessary to reach genetic equilibrium. The ultimate goal is extracting as much information from present‐day patterns of human variation relevannt to issues of human origins. Our results are in agreement with mismatch distribution analysis of mtDNA, and they support a “weak Garden o Eden” model. In this model, modern‐day variation can be explained by divergence from an initial source (perhaps Africa) into a number o small isolated populations, followed by later population expansion throughout our species. The major populationn expansions of Homo sapiens during and after the late Pleistocene have had the effect of “freezing” ancient patterns of population structure. While this is not the only possible scenario, we do note the close agreement with ecent analyses of mtDNA mismatch distibutions. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

However, admixture is not a universally beneficial genetic phenomenon. Selection is typically expected to favour locally adapted genotypes and can act against admixed individuals, suggesting that there are some conditions under which admixture will have negative impacts on population fitness. Therefore, it remains unclear how often admixture acts as a true driver of colonisation success. Here, we review the population consequences of admixture and discuss its costs and benefits across a broad spectrum of ecological contexts. We critically evaluate the evidence for a causal role of admixture in successful colonisation, and consider that role more generally in driving population range expansion. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"colonization; fitness; genetic structure; range expansion; selection; genotype; intraspecific interaction; local adaptation; animal dispersal; evolution; genetic selection; genetic variability; heterosis; population genetics; trends; Animal Distribution; Biological Evolution; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Hybrid Vigor; Selection, Genetic",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897065277

Well-dated and well-preserved fossils older than ∼45,000 years that can be unequivocally attributed to Homo sapiens are lacking. Here we present evidence from the newly excavated Fuyan Cave in Daoxian (southern China). This site has provided 47 human teeth dated to more than 80,000 years old, and with an inferred maximum age of 120,000 years. The morphological and metric assessment of this sample supports its unequivocal assignment to H. sapiens. The Daoxian sample is more derived than any other anatomically modern humans, resembling middle-to-late Late Pleistocene specimens and even contemporary humans. Our study shows that fully modern morphologies were present in southern China 30,000-70,000 years earlier than in the Levant and Europe. Our data fill a chronological and geographical gap that is relevant for understanding when H. sapiens first appeared in southern Asia. The Daoxian teeth also support the hypothesis that during the same period, southern China was inhabited by more derived populations than central and northern China. This evidence is important for the study of dispersal routes of modern humans. Finally, our results are relevant to exploring the reasons for the relatively late entry of H. sapiens into Europe. Some studies have investigated how the competition with H. sapiens may have caused Neanderthals' extinction (see ref. 8 and references therein). Notably, although fully modern humans were already present in southern China at least as early as ∼80,000 years ago, there is no evidence that they entered Europe before ∼45,000 years ago. This could indicate that H. neanderthalensis was indeed an additional ecological barrier for modern humans, who could only enter Europe when the demise of Neanderthals had already started. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,"chronology; competition (ecology); dispersal; extinction; fossil record; human evolution; morphology; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; tooth; anatomical concepts; Article; Asia; cave; China; chronology; Europe; fossil; geographical variation (species); Homo neanderthalensis; human; morphology; priority journal; species extinction; tooth; Upper Pleistocene; anatomy and histology; animal; China; fossil; history; Homo neanderthalensis; migration; time factor; China; Europe; Levant; Mediterranean Region; Homo sapiens; Animals; Caves; China; Europe; Fossils; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Neanderthals; Time Factors; Tooth",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945953770

It is widely held, in both archaeology and linguistics, that they are largely descended from a second wave of dispersal, proto-Austronesian-speaking agriculturalists who originated in China and spread to Taiwan ∼5,500 years ago. From there, they are thought to have dispersed into ISEA ∼4,000 years ago, assimilating the indigenous populations. Here, we demonstrate that mitochondrial DNA diversity in the region is extremely high and includes a large number of indigenous clades. Only a fraction of these date back to the time of first settlement, and the majority appear to mark dispersals in the late-Pleistocene or early-Holocene epoch most likely triggered by postglacial flooding. There are much closer genetic links to Taiwan than to the mainland, but most of these probably predated the mid-Holocene ""Out of Taiwan"" event as traditionally envisioned. Only ∼20% at most of modern mitochondrial DNAs in ISEA could be linked to such an event, suggesting that, if an agriculturalist migration did take place, it was demographically minor, at least with regard to the involvement of women. © 2006 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

Its morphological features, as well as size and shape characteristics, indicate that the Callao metatarsal definitely belongs to the genus Homo. Morphometric analysis of the Callao metatarsal indicates that it has a gracile structure, close to that observed in other small-bodied Homo sapiens. Interestingly, the Callao metatarsal also falls within the morphological and size ranges of Homo habilis and H. floresiensis. Identifying whether the metatarsal represents the earliest record of H. sapiens so far recorded anywhere east of Wallace's Line requires further archaeological research, but its presence on the isolated island of Luzon over 65,000 years ago further demonstrates the abilities of humans to make open ocean crossings in the Late Pleistocene. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cave faunas; Hominin dispersal; Southeast Asia; U-series dating","bone; cave deposit; dispersal; fossil record; hominid; morphology; morphometry; uranium series dating; Cagayan; Cagayan Valley; Callao Cave; Luzon; Philippines; Gabaza; Homo floresiensis; Homo habilis; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954218799

Here we generate high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers of Pama-Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25-40 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting pre-Holocene population structure in the ancient continent of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all of the studied Aboriginal Australians descend from a single founding population that differentiated ∼10-32 kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia during the Holocene epoch (past 10,000 years) associated with limited gene flow from this region to the rest of Australia, consistent with the spread of the Pama-Nyungan languages. We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51-72 kya, following a single out-of-Africa dispersal, and subsequently admixed with archaic populations.

Nevertheless, the availability of high-resolution genomic data has led to the development of new methodologies for inferring population history and refuelled the debate on the mutation rate in humans. Here we present the Estonian Biocentre Human Genome Diversity Panel (EGDP), a dataset of 483 high-coverage human genomes from 148 populations worldwide, including 379 new genomes from 125 populations, which we group into diversity and selection sets. We analyse this dataset to refine estimates of continent-wide patterns of heterozygosity, long-and short-distance gene flow, archaic admixture, and changes in effective population size through time as well as for signals of positive or balancing selection. We find a genetic signature in present-day Papuans that suggests that at least 2% of their genome originates from an early and largely extinct expansion of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) out of Africa. Together with evidence from the western Asian fossil record, and admixture between AMHs and Neanderthals predating the main Eurasian expansion, our results contribute to the mounting evidence for the presence of AMHs out of Africa earlier than 75,000 years ago. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"cancer; effective population size; fossil record; gene flow; genome; heterozygosity; mutation; Neanderthal; Africa; Article; Asia; cancer genetics; effective population size; Estonia; fossil human; gene flow; gene sequence; gene structure; genetic analysis; genetic database; genetic recombination; genetic variability; genome analysis; genomics; haplotype; heterozygosity; human; human activities; human genetics; human genome; migration; nonhuman; population dispersal; population genetics; population research; predation; priority journal; ancestry group; animal; ethnology; Europe; fossil; genetics; heterozygote; history; Homo neanderthalensis; human genome; information processing; migration; Oceanic ancestry group; Papua New Guinea; population dynamics; population genetics; Africa; Eurasia; Indonesia; Papua [(PRV) Indonesia]; West Asia; Africa; Animals; Asia; Continental Population Groups; Datasets as Topic; Estonia; Europe; Fossils; Gene Flow; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Genomics; Heterozygote; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Neanderthals; New Guinea; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981502573

Largely because of the influence of linguistic studies, however, which have a shallow time depth, the attention of archaeologists and geneticists has usually been focused on the last 6,000 years - in particular, on a proposed Neolithic dispersal from China and Taiwan. Here we use complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome sequencing to spotlight some earlier processes that clearly had a major role in the demographic history of the region but have hitherto been unrecognized. We show that haplogroup E, an important component of mtDNA diversity in the region, evolved in situ over the last 35,000 years and expanded dramatically throughout ISEA around the beginning of the Holocene, at the time when the ancient continent of Sundaland was being broken up into the present-day archipelago by rising sea levels. It reached Taiwan and Near Oceania more recently, within the last ∼8,000 years. This suggests that global warming and sea-level rises at the end of the Ice Age, 15,000-7,000 years ago, were the main forces shaping modern human diversity in the region. © The Author 2008.

Fossil, archaeological and genetic findings are seen to converge around a consensus view that a single population of H. sapiens exited Africa sometime around 60 thousand years ago (ka), and rapidly reached Australia by following a coastal dispersal corridor. We challenge the notion that current evidence supports this straightforward model. We argue that the fossil and archaeological records are too incomplete, the coastal route too problematic, and recent genomic evidence too incompatible for researchers not to remain fully open to other hypotheses. We specifically explore the possibility of a sustained exit by anatomically modern humans, drawing in particular upon palaeoenvironmental data across southern Asia to demonstrate its feasibility. Current archaeological, genetic and fossil data are not incompatible with the model presented, and appear to increasingly favour a more complex out of Africa scenario involving multiple exits, varying terrestrial routes, a sub-divided African source population, slower progress to Australia, and a degree of interbreeding with archaic varieties of Homo. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"archaeological evidence; dispersal; fossil record; hominid; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; Asia; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878955342

In this paper I present the infinite island model, the unidimensional stepping-stone model, and the migration matrix method in forms that allow prediction of the genetic distance between groups separated by a given spatial and temporal lag. These models demonstrate that, if there is isolation by geographic distance, then the correlation between genetic and spatial distance (controlling for temporal distance) should be positive and the correlation between genetic and temporal distance (controlling for spatial distance) should be negative. I use observations of nonmetric traits in a sample of prehistoric crania from west-central Illinois to demonstrate the expected relationships among biological, temporal, and spatial distance. The results indicate that, once the effects of temporal trend are removed, biological and spatial distance are positively correlated and biological and temporal distance negatively correlated within this sample.",,"anthropometry; conference paper; geographic distribution; history; human; mathematical model; population dynamics; population structure; skull; Craniometry; Emigration and Immigration; Gene Pool; Genetics, Population; Human; Illinois; Models, Genetic; Paleontology; Population Dynamics; Variation (Genetics); Crania",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025006791

Although genetic and archeological data indicate a rapid migration out of Africa and into Southeast Asia by at least 60 ka, mainland Southeast Asia is notable for its absence of fossil evidence for early modern human occupation. Here we report on a modern human cranium from Tam Pa Ling, Laos, which was recovered from a secure stratigraphic context. Radiocarbon and luminescence dating of the surrounding sediments provide a minimum age of 51-46 ka, and direct U-dating of the bone indicates a maximum age of ∼63 ka. The cranium has a derived modern human morphology in features of the frontal, occipital, maxillae, and dentition. It is also differentiated from western Eurasian archaic humans in aspects of its temporal, occipital, and dental morphology. In the context of an increasingly documented archaic-modern morphological mosaic among the earliest modern humans in western Eurasia, Tam Pa Ling establishes a definitively modern population in Southeast Asia at &sim50 ka cal BP. As such, it provides the earliest skeletal evidence for fully modern humans in mainland Southeast Asia.","Eastern eurasia; Human migrations","carbon 14; article; craniofacial morphology; dentition; frontal bone; human; Laos; luminescence; maxilla; occipital bone; Paleolithic; priority journal; radiometric dating; stratigraphy; Carbon Radioisotopes; Emigration and Immigration; Fossils; History, Ancient; Humans; Laos; Luminescence; Skull; Species Specificity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865965394

In turn, this has led to suggestions that the temporal bone is particularly reliable in analyses of primate phylogeny and human population history. While several reasons have been suggested to explain the temporal bone's strong fit with neutral expectation, the temporal bone has never systematically been compared against other individual cranial bones defined using the same biological criteria. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the shapes of all cranial bones possess reliable information regarding neutral genetic evolution, or whether the temporal bone is unique in this respect. This study tests the hypothesis that the human temporal bone is more congruent with neutral expectation than six other individual cranial bones by correlating population affinity matrices generated using neutral genetic and 3D craniometric data. The results demonstrate that while the temporal bone shows the absolute strongest correlation with neutral genetic data compared with all other bones, it is not statistically differentiated from the sphenoid, frontal, and parietal bones in this regard. Potential reasons for the temporal bone's consistently strong fit with neutral expectation, such as its overall anatomical complexity and/or its contribution to the architecture of the basicranium, are examined. The results suggest that future phylogenetic and taxonomic studies would benefit from considering the shape of the entire cranium minus those regions that deviate most from neutrality. ©2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Neutral evolution; Population history; Temporal bone","article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; frontal bone; human; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phylogeny; physical anthropology; population genetics; primate; skull; sphenoid; temporal bone; Bone Development; Classification; Fossils; Gene Frequency; Genetic Markers; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Phylogeny; Skull; Temporal Bone; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349102576

However, this has yet to be analyzed at a global level. Here, the relationship between global mandibular shape variation and subsistence economy is tested, while controlling for the potentially confounding effects of shared population history, geography, and climate. The results demonstrate that the mandible, in contrast to the cranium, significantly reflects subsistence strategy rather than neutral genetic patterns, with hunter-gatherers having consistently longer and narrower mandibles than agriculturalists. These results support notions that a decrease in masticatory stress among agriculturalists causes the mandible to grow and develop differently. This developmental argument also explains why there is often a mismatch between the size of the lower face and the dentition, which, in turn, leads to increased prevalence of dental crowding and malocclusions in modern postindustrial populations. Therefore, these results have important implications for our understanding of human masticatory adaptation.","Diet; Mastication; Phenotypic plasticity; Skull","agriculture; animal hunting; article; climate; cold; dentition; economic aspect; face; fishing; genetics; geography; history; human; malocclusion; mandible; mastication; masticatory muscle; maxilla; palate; priority journal; skull; thermoregulation; Adaptation, Physiological; Agriculture; Animal Husbandry; Biological Evolution; Diet; Female; Humans; Life Style; Male; Mandible; Models, Anatomic; Sex Factors; Skull; Stomatognathic System; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-83755183406

A major methodological difficulty has been the lack of formal testing procedures with which to assess the degree of confirmation or disconfirmation of an estimated measure of relationship between such matrices. In this paper, we examine a very flexible matrix combinatorial procedure which generates statistical significance levels for correlational measures of pattern similarity between distance matrices. A recent generalization of the basic procedure to the three‐matrix case allowsquestions concerning which of two matrices best fits a third matrix to be formally tested. Applications of these hypothesis testing and inference procedures to two separate sets of genetic, geographic, and cultural distance matrices illustrates their potential for finally solving a long‐standing problem in anthropological genetics.

Here, in the largest survey of Indonesian Y chromosomes to date, we present evidence for multiple genetic strata that likely arose through a series of distinct migratory processes. We genotype an extensive battery of Y chromosome markers, including 85 single-nucleotide polymorphisms/indels and 12 short tandem repeats, in a sample of 1,917 men from 32 communities located across Indonesia. We find that the paternal gene pool is sharply subdivided between western and eastern locations, with a boundary running between the islands of Bali and Flores. Analysis of molecular variance reveals one of the highest levels of between-group variance yet reported for human Y chromosome data (e.g., ΦST = 0.47). Eastern Y chromosome haplogroups are closely related to Melanesian lineages (i.e., within the C, M, and S subclades) and likely reflect the initial wave of colonization of the region, whereas the majority of western Y chromosomes (i.e., O-M119*, O-P203, and O-M95*) are related to haplogroups that may have entered Indonesia during the Paleolithic from mainland Asia. In addition, two novel markers (P201 and P203) provide significantly enhanced phylogenetic resolution of two key haplogroups (O-M122 and O-M119) that are often associated with the Austronesian expansion. This more refined picture leads us to put forward a four-phase colonization model in which Paleolithic migrations of hunter-gatherers shape the primary structure of current Indonesian Y chromosome diversity, and Neolithic incursions make only a minor impact on the paternal gene pool, despite the large cultural impact of the Austronesian expansion. © The Author 2010.

The R-matrix method was applied using a pooled within-group variance-covariance matrix estimated with the maximum likelihood method (tetrachoric correlation matrix) and the threshold value for each trait estimated by univariate probit analysis. Using average heritability rates that range from 0.40 to 1.00, the inter-regional variation represented by Fst falls between 7.19% and 16.23% of the total variance. This range of variation is compatible with those obtained by genetic, craniometric, and odontometric data. Subsaharan Africans show the largest intra-regional diversity among the groups compared. The degree of intra-regional variation shows, moreover, rough clinalities from subsaharan Africa to peripheral regions. The relationship between regional variation and geographic distance from subsaharan Africa supports serial bottlenecks and the founder effect of ancient populations originating in Africa. The variation of East/Northeast Asians is relatively large, suggesting a complex population history such as possible earlier divergence and multiple migrations from outside sources. The present findings are in agreement with both the recent African model for the origin of anatomically modern humans and the current scenario for human migration history suggested by genetic analyses. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Inter-regional variation; Intra-regional variation; Modern human origins; Patterns of modern human diversity; Subsaharan Africans","article; female; genetic analysis; genetic variability; human; male; odontometry; phenotype; tooth; tooth crown; Africa; Africa South of the Sahara; African Continental Ancestry Group; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Dentition; Egypt; Female; Geography; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Male; Models, Genetic; Paleodontology; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-44449137008

A major reason this taxon is controversial is because the H. floresiensis-bearing deposits, which include associated stone artefacts and remains of other extinct endemic fauna, were dated to between about 95 and 12 thousand calendar years (kyr) ago. These ages suggested that H. floresiensis survived until long after modern humans reached Australia by ∼50 kyr ago. Here we report new stratigraphic and chronological evidence from Liang Bua that does not support the ages inferred previously for the H. floresiensis holotype (LB1), ∼18 thousand calibrated radiocarbon years before present (kyr cal. bp), or the time of last appearance of this species (about 17 or 13-11 kyr cal. bp). Instead, the skeletal remains of H. floresiensis and the deposits containing them are dated to between about 100 and 60 kyr ago, whereas stone artefacts attributable to this species range from about 190 to 50 kyr in age. Whether H. floresiensis survived after 50 kyr ago - potentially encountering modern humans on Flores or other hominins dispersing through southeast Asia, such as Denisovans - is an open question. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In extant human populations, the observation of decreasing genetic and phenotypic diversity at increasing distances from sub-Saharan Africa has been interpreted as evidence for a single dispersal, accompanied by a series of founder effects. In such a scenario, modern human genetic and phenotypic variation was primarily generated through successive population bottlenecks and drift during a rapid worldwide expansion out of Africa in the Late Pleistocene. However, recent genetic studies, as well as accumulating archaeological and paleoanthropological evidence, challenge this parsimonious model. They suggest instead a ""southern route"" dispersal into Asia as early as the late Middle Pleistocene, followed by a separate dispersal into northern Eurasia. Here we test these competing out-of-Africa scenarios by modeling hypothetical geographical migration routes and assessing their correlation with neutral population differentiation, as measured by genetic polymorphisms and cranial shape variables of modern human populations from Africa and Asia. We showthat both lines of evidence support amultiple-dispersalsmodel in which Australo-Melanesian populations are relatively isolated descendants of an early dispersal, whereas other Asian populations are descended from, or highly admixed with, members of a subsequent migration event.",,"Africa; archeology; article; Asia; biodiversity; controlled study; evolution; founder effect; gene mutation; genetic drift; genetic polymorphism; genomics; human; Middle Pleistocene; paleoanthropology; phenotypic variation; population; population differentiation; population migration; population structure; priority journal; temporal bone; Upper Pleistocene; cranial diversity; genome diversity; human evolution; modern human origins; SNPs; Africa; Asia; Biological Evolution; Founder Effect; Genomics; Geography; Human Migration; Humans; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Population Dynamics; Skull; Software",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901008925

The alternative framework that we present improves our understanding of the nature of the Austronesian language dispersal from Taiwan and better accords with the population genetics, archaeological evidence, and crop domestication histories for ISEA. Genetic studies do not demonstrate that the dispersal of Austronesian languages through ISEA was associated with large-scale displacement, replacement, or absorption of preexisting populations. Linguistic phylogenies for Austronesian languages do not support staged movement from Taiwan through the Philippines into Indo-Malaysia; in addition, the lexical and grammatical structure of many Austronesian languages suggests significant interaction with pre-Austronesian languages and cultures of the region. Archaeological evidence, including domestication histories for major food plants, indicates that ISEA was a zone of considerable maritime interaction before the appearance of Austronesian languages. Material culture dispersed through ISEA from multiple sources along a mosaic of regional networks. The archaeological evidence helps us to shape a new interpretative framework of the social and historical processes that more parsimoniously accounts for apparent discrepancies between genetic phylogenies and linguistic distributions and allows for more nuanced models of the dispersal of technologies and societies without reference to the farming/language dispersal hypothesis.© 2010 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949837252

We examined teeth from 4,002 individuals comprising 42 prehistoric and historic samples from East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and Melanesia. For the odontometric analysis, dental size proportions were compared using factor analysis and Q-mode correlation coefficients, and overall tooth size was also compared between population samples. Nonmetric population affinities were estimated by Smith's distances, using the frequencies of 16 tooth traits. The results of both the metric and nonmetric analyses demonstrate close affinities between recent Australo-Melanesian samples and samples representing early Southeast Asia, such as the Early to Middle Holocene series from Vietnam, Malaysia, and Flores. In contrast, the dental characteristics of most modern Southeast Asians exhibit a mixture of traits associated with East Asians and Australo-Melanesians, suggesting that these populations were genetically influenced by immigrants from East Asia. East Asian metric and/or nonmetric traits are also found in some prehistoric samples from Southeast Asia such as Ban Kao (Thailand), implying that immigration probably began in the early Neolithic. Much clearer influence of East Asian immigration was found in Early Metal Age Vietnamese and Sulawesi samples. Although the results of this study are consistent with the immigration hypothesis, analysis of additional Neolithic samples is needed to determine the exact timing of population dispersals into Southeast Asia. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Dentition; Multivariate analysis; Neolithic dispersals; Population history; Southeast Asians","Australia; correlation coefficient; human; immigrant; Melanesia; metric system; odontometry; population dispersal; review; Southeast Asia; tooth size; Asia, Southeastern; Cluster Analysis; Demography; Fossils; Geography; History, Ancient; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Odontometry; Population Dynamics; Tooth",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18644381496

The different methods have advantages and limitations and special features of the twinning process are important to consider. Model-fitting approaches have shown that different combinations of additive genetic variance (A), non-additive genetic variance (D), common environmental variance (C), and unique environmental variance (E) contribute to phenotypic variation within the dentition, reflecting different ontogenetic and phylogenetic influences. Epigenetic factors are also proposed as important in explaining differences in the dentitions of monozygotic co-twins. Heritability estimates are high for most tooth size variables, for Carabelli trait and for dental arch dimensions, moderate for intercuspal distances, and low for some occlusal traits. In addition to estimating the contributions of unmeasured genetic and environmental influences to phenotypic variation, structural equation models can also be used to test the effects of measured genetic and environmental factors.

The site also contains one of the largest stone artefact assemblages in Sahul for this early period. However, the stone artefacts and other important archaeological components of the site have never been described in detail, leading to persistent doubts about its stratigraphic integrity. We report on our analysis of the stone artefacts and faunal and other materials recovered during the 1989 excavations, as well as the stratigraphy and depositional history recorded by the original excavators. We demonstrate that the technology and raw materials of the early assemblage are distinctive from those in the overlying layers. Silcrete and quartzite artefacts are common in the early assemblage, which also includes edge-ground axe fragments and ground haematite. The lower flaked stone assemblage is distinctive, comprising a mix of long convergent flakes, some radial flakes with faceted platforms, and many small thin silcrete flakes that we interpret as thinning flakes. Residue and use-wear analysis indicate occasional grinding of haematite and woodworking, as well as frequent abrading of platform edges on thinning flakes. We conclude that previous claims of extensive displacement of artefacts and post-depositional disturbance may have been overstated. The stone artefacts and stratigraphic details support previous claims for human occupation 50-60ka and show that human occupation during this time differed from later periods. We discuss the implications of these new data for understanding the first human colonisation of Sahul. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Australia; Chronology; Colonisation; Grindstones; Lithic technology; Stone axes","archaeology; artifact; chronology; colonization; lithic fragment; settlement history; settlement pattern; stratigraphy; Australia; archeology; artifact; Australia; history; human; occupation; procedures; technology; Archaeology; Artifacts; Australia; History, Ancient; Humans; Occupations; Technology",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930182724

The emergence of an autonomous evolutionary biology has largely engulfed human evolutionary studies. Most perspectives of earlier workers are inexplicit in regard to phylogenetic inference, taxonomic resolution, process, pattern, tempo, and other aspects of hominin evolution, and thus are archaic, irrelevant, or both. Matters of epistemology have scarcely merited explicit, critical consideration; even inference as to the best explanation (abduction) has rarely been employed, or employed consistently. Human populations, their genic structure, variability, affinities and histories are now elucidated and directly quantified through molecular biology and population genetics. Past hominin populations are increasingly composed of samples necessary and sufficient to characterize paleo-demes (p-demes) and, ultimately, species clades representative of spatio-temporally bounded entities, the nature and affinities of which are informed through functional, cladistic, and morphometrical investigation. Diverse aspects of earlier hominin habitats, distributions, adaptations, and behavioral parameters are increasingly revealed through multifaceted approaches, all within the framework of paleoanthropology and focused on fuller recovery and elucidation of the Pleistocene archaeological record. Here, some central aspects of Pleistocene hominin evolution are broadly set out from such perspectives.

Simultaneously, the archaeological potential of the Tabon site has been re-assessed and fieldwork organized by the National Museum of the Philippines yielded another eleven human remains. Palaeoanthropological description and new dating of the human fossils from Tabon cave are proposed and discussed. Some of the new dates obtained confirm the ca. 16 500 BP age of the frontal bone [9], but older ages have been obtained for other human fossils.

Recent evidence from these diverse fields is found to support different colonization scenarios. The currently available genetic evidence suggests a ″single migration″ model, in which both early and later Native American groups derive from one expansion event into the continent. In contrast, the pronounced anatomical differences between early and late Native American populations have led others to propose more complex scenarios, involving separate colonization events of the New World and a distinct origin for these groups. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using large samples of Early American crania, we: 1) calculated the rate of morphological differentiation between Early and Late American samples under three different time divergence assumptions, and compared our findings to the predicted morphological differentiation under neutral conditions in each case; and 2) further tested three dispersal scenarios for the colonization of the New World by comparing the morphological distances among early and late Amerindians, East Asians, Australo-Melanesians and early modern humans from Asia to geographical distances associated with each dispersion model. Results indicate that the assumption of a last shared common ancestor outside the continent better explains the observed morphological differences between early and late American groups. This result is corroborated by our finding that a model comprising two Asian waves of migration coming through Bering into the Americas fits the cranial anatomical evidence best, especially when the effects of diversifying selection to climate are taken into account. Conclusions: We conclude that the morphological diversity documented through time in the New World is best accounted for by a model postulating two waves of human expansion into the continent originating in East Asia and entering through Beringia. © 2010 Hubbe et al.",,"American Indian; article; Asia; Asian; calculation; climate; controlled study; evolution; geographic distribution; human; last common ancestor; Melanesia; morphology; population dispersion; population migration; sample; skull; time; Western Hemisphere; geography; Crania; Americas; Evolution; Geography; Humans",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956203274

It is highly debated to what extent this variability has accumulated through neutral processes (genetic drift) or through natural selection driven by climate. By taking advantage of recent work showing that geographic distance along landmasses is an excellent proxy for neutral genetic differentiation, we quantify the relative role of drift versus selection in an exceptionally large dataset of human skulls. We show that neutral processes have been much more important than climate in shaping the human cranium. We further demonstrate that a large proportion of the signal for natural selection comes from populations from extremely cold regions.

We show that all sampled Austronesian groups harbour ancestry that is more closely related to aboriginal Taiwanese than to any present-day mainland population. Surprisingly, western Island Southeast Asian populations have also inherited ancestry from a source nested within the variation of present-day populations speaking Austro-Asiatic languages, which have historically been nearly exclusive to the mainland.

Debates have centred on the extent to which the transition was associated with the active migration of people as opposed to the diffusion of cultural practices. Recent studies have shown that patterns of human cranial shape variation can be employed as a reliable proxy for the neutral genetic relationships of human populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we employ measurements of Mesolithic (hunter-gatherers) and Neolithic (farmers) crania from Southwest Asia and Europe to test several alternative population dispersal and hunter-farmer gene-flow models. We base our alternative hypothetical models on a null evolutionary model of isolation-by-geographic and temporal distance. Partial Mantel tests were used to assess the congruence between craniometric distance and each of the geographic model matrices, while controlling for temporal distance. Our results demonstrate that the craniometric data fit a model of continuous dispersal of people (and their genes) from Southwest Asia to Europe significantly better than a null model of cultural diffusion. Conclusions/Significance: Therefore, this study does not support the assertion that farming in Europe solely involved the adoption of technologies and ideas from Southwest Asia by indigenous Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. Moreover, the results highlight the utility of craniometric data for assessing patterns of past population dispersal and gene flow. © 2009 Pinhasi et al.",,"article; Asia; controlled study; craniometry; demic diffusion model; Europe; gene flow; genetic distance; genetic isolation by distance; genetic model; geographic distribution; human; Mesolithic; molecular evolution; Neolithic; population differentiation; population dispersion; population model; population movement pattern; agriculture; cephalometry; theoretical model; Crania; Agriculture; Cephalometry; Europe; Humans; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-69849090986

The Negritos are believed to have originated from the ancient migration, whereas the majority of island Southeast Asians are associated with the Austronesian expansion. We determined 86 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) complete genome sequences in four indigenous Malaysian populations, together with a reanalysis of published autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of Southeast Asians to test the plausibility and impact of those migration models. The three Austronesian groups (Bidayuh, Selatar, and Temuan) showed high frequencies of mtDNA haplogroups, which originated from the Asian mainland ∼30,000-10,000 YBP, but low frequencies of Out of Taiwan markers. Principal component analysis and phylogenetic analysis using autosomal SNP data indicate a dichotomy between continental and island Austronesian groups. We argue that both the mtDNA and autosomal data suggest an Early Train migration originating from Indochina or South China around the late-Pleistocene to early-Holocene period, which predates, but may not necessarily exclude, the Austronesian expansion. © 2012 The Author.","Austronesian; mitochondrial DNA; Negrito; Orang Asli; Southeast Asia","mitochondrial DNA; article; gene frequency; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic association; haplotype; Holocene; human; migration; nucleotide sequence; single nucleotide polymorphism; Southeast Asia; Upper Pleistocene; Asia, Southeastern; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Base Sequence; Biological Evolution; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ethnic Groups; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genome, Human; Genotype; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Population Density; Principal Component Analysis; Statistics as Topic; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866609702

However, human genetic evidence is more controversial. Until now, there had been no ancient skeletal evidence of a potential Austronesian-speaking ancestor prior to the Taiwan Neolithic ∼6,000 years ago, and genetic studies have largely ignored the role of genetic diversity within Taiwan as well as the origins of Formosans. We address these issues via analysis of a complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequence of an ∼8,000-year-old skeleton from Liang Island (located between China and Taiwan) and 550 mtDNA genome sequences from 8 aboriginal (highland) Formosan and 4 other Taiwanese groups. We show that the Liangdao Man mtDNA sequence is closest to Formosans, provides a link to southern China, and has the most ancestral haplogroup E sequence found among extant Austronesian speakers. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis allows us to reconstruct a history of early Austronesians arriving in Taiwan in the north ∼6,000 years ago, spreading rapidly to the south, and leaving Taiwan ∼4,000 years ago to spread throughout Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and Oceania. © 2014 The American Society of Human Genetics.",,"mitochondrial DNA; Aborigine; article; China; DNA extraction; DNA library; gene flow; gene sequence; genetic linkage; genetic variability; genome; haplotype; high throughput sequencing; human; human tissue; language; Madagascar; molecular clock; Neolithic; Pacific islands; phylogeny; priority journal; Taiwan; Anthropology, Physical; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Female; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Haplotypes; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Language; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Skeleton; Taiwan",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896789927

The relative plane surface area, a projection of the basal surface area, can be described by a series of vectors which outline each crown component as a polygon. The description of the dentition in this way is essential to a variety of experimental designs, i.e., the analysis of the range of variation of occulsion, the measuring and expression of shape and the description of the “within tooth” variations in size and position of each crown component.

However, many evolutionary analyses based on dental traits overlook the constraints that limit dental evolution. These constraints are diverse, ranging from developmental interactions between the individual elements of a homologous series (the whole dentition) to functional constraints related to occlusion. This study evaluates morphological integration in the hominin dentition and its effect on dental evolution in an extensive sample of Plio- and Pleistocene hominin teeth using geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods. Results reveal that premolars and molars display significant levels of covariation; that integration is stronger in the mandibular dentition than in the maxillary dentition; and that antagonist teeth, especially first molars, are strongly integrated. Results also show an association of morphological integration and evolution. Stasis is observed in elements with strong functional and/or developmental interactions, namely in first molars. Alternatively, directional evolution (and weaker integration) occurs in the elements with marginal roles in occlusion and mastication, probably in response to other direct or indirect selective pressures. This study points to the need to reevaluate hypotheses about hominin evolution based on dental characters, given the complex scenario in which teeth evolve. © 2012 The Author(s).

A combined consideration of the multiregional results within all three disciplines (archaeology, linguistics, and biology) offers a historical perspective that will never be obtained from one discipline or one region alone. The fundamental process of human behavior involved in such expansion-population dispersal linked to increases in human population size-is significant for explaining the early spreads of food production and language families in many parts of the world.

In laboratory conditions they hybridize, and F1, F2 and backcross hybrids may be obtained easily. Some interspecific matings do not succeed due to anatomical incompatibilities resulting from morphological differences in the genitalia of the species. One of these differences involves the clasper, a highly sclerotized process of the male genitalia. The overall contour of the clasper in S. descoinsi, S. latifascia, F1, F2, and backcross hybrids was analysed using elliptic Fourier analysis. All outlines were rotated along a common direction defined by two homologous landmarks, centered, and normalized for size. Fourier descriptors were used in a canonical variate analysis. Shape variations along factorial axes, or more generally along any variate of interest, such as size, were modelized by a multivariate regressive approach and visualized by inverse Fourier reconstructions of shapes. This approach allows a direct visualization of the shape transformations, negating the so-called impossibility or difficulty to interpret results of Fourier analyses. The results emphasize the specificity of the male clasper in the parental species. Most hybrids and backcrosses segregate from their parents. Many of them are displaced towards one of the parental forms. These results suggest that morphological differences may be controlled by a polygenic system with maternal effect in F1 and parental dominance in backcross hybrids. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.","Artificial hybridization; Canonical variate analysis; Discriminant analysis; Dominance; Maternal effect; Morphometrics; Outline; Size and shape inheritance","backcrossing; Fourier analysis; genetic regulation; genital system; hybrid; insect genetics; interspecific hybridization; morphology; multivariate analysis; reproductive development; Lepidoptera; Mythimna unipuncta; Noctuidae; Spodoptera; Spodoptera; Spodoptera descoinsi; Spodoptera latifascia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034961616

Despite the complexity of this cultural environment, genetic studies in Indonesia remain surprisingly sparse. Here, we report mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and associated Y-chromosome diversity for the largest cohort of Indonesians examined to date - 2740 individuals from 70 communities spanning 12 islands across the breadth of the Indonesian archipelago. We reconstruct 50 000 years of population movements, from mitochondrial lineages reflecting the very earliest settlers in island southeast Asia, to Neolithic population dispersals. Historic contacts from Chinese, Indians, Arabs and Europeans comprise a noticeable fraction of Y-chromosome variation, but are not reflected in the maternally inherited mtDNA. While this historic immigration favored men, patterns of genetic diversity show that women moved more widely in earlier times. However, measures of population differentiation signal that Indonesian communities are trending away from the matri- or ambilocality of early Austronesian societies toward the more common practice of patrilocal residence today. Such sex-specific dispersal patterns remain even after correcting for the different mutation rates of mtDNA and the Y chromosome.

Location: Southern and eastern Asia, Australia, and Oceania. Methods: Review of the literature and detailed compilations of data on early human settlements, sea level, and climate change. Results: The expansion of modern humans out of Africa, following a coastal route into southern Asia, was initially thwarted by a series of large and abrupt environmental changes. A period of relatively stable climate and sea level from c. 45,000 yr bp to 40,000 yr bp supported a rapid coastal expansion of modern humans throughout much of Southeast Asia, enabling them to reach the coasts of northeast Russia and Japan by 38,000-37,000 yr bp. Further northwards, migrations were delayed by cold northern climates, which began to deteriorate rapidly after 33,000 yr bp. Human migrations along the coast of the Bering Sea into the New World appear to have occurred much later, c. 14,000 yr bp, probably by people from central Asia who were better adapted to cold northern climates. Cold, dry climates and rapidly changing sea levels leading into and out of the Last Glacial Maximum inhibited coastal settlement, and many of the sites occupied prior to 33,000 yr bp were abandoned. After 16,000 yr bp, the sea-level rise slowed enough to permit coastal ecosystems to develop and coasts to be re-colonized, but abrupt changes in climate and sea level inhibited this development until after 12,000 yr bp. Between 12,000 yr bp and 7000 yr bp there was a dramatic increase in reef and estuary/lagoon ecosystems, concurrent with a major expansion of coastal settlements. This early Holocene increase in coastal environments and the concomitant expansion of human coastal-resource exploitation were followed by corresponding declines in both phenomena in the mid-Holocene, c. 6000-4000 yr bp. This decline in coastal resources is linked to the drop in sea level throughout the Pacific, which may have caused the widespread population dislocations that ultimately led to the human expansion throughout Oceania. Main conclusions: Climate and sea-level changes played a central role in the peopling of the circum-Pacific region. © 2007 The Authors.","Archaeology; Climate change; Holocene; Homo sapiens; Human genetics; Human migrations; Palaeoenvironments; Pleistocene; Sea level","archaeological evidence; climate change; genetics; human settlement; Last Glacial Maximum; migration; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene-Holocene boundary; sea level change; Africa; Asia; Bering Sea; Eurasia; Pacific Ocean; Homo sapiens",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-37149020150

We report here, a survey of Y-chromosome variation in 390 individuals from 16 Filipino ethnolinguistic groups, including six Negrito groups, from across the archipelago. We find extreme diversity in the Y-chromosome lineages of Filipino groups with heterogeneity seen in both Negrito and non-Negrito groups, which does not support a simple dichotomy of Filipino groups as Negrito vs non-Negrito. Filipino non-recombining region of the human Y chromosome lineages reflect a chronology that extends from after the initial colonization of the Asia-Pacific region, to the time frame of the Austronesian expansion. Filipino groups appear to have diverse genetic affinities with different populations in the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, some Negrito groups are associated with indigenous Australians, with a potential time for the association ranging from the initial colonization of the region to more recent (after colonization) times. Overall, our results indicate extensive heterogeneity contributing to a complex genetic history for Filipino groups, with varying roles for migrations from outside the Philippines, genetic drift, and admixture among neighboring groups. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","Filipino; genetic affinity; heterogeneity; Negrito; Y-chromosome","article; Asia; Australia; genetic drift; genetic heterogeneity; genetic variability; human; male; migration; negrito; Philippines; population genetics; priority journal; race; Y chromosome; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Philippines; Population Groups; Software",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651382473

Much of this difficulty is rooted in the historical use of craniometric data to justify essentialist typological racial classification schemes. In the post-war era of the 'New Physical Anthropology' (sensu Washburn, 1951), anthropologists began to analyse human variation in an explicitly populationist and evolutionary philosophical and analytical framework. However, even within recent decades, substantially different approaches have been employed; some advocate a focus on the analysis of individual traits or clines, while others are explicitly adaptationist, with a focus on natural selection as the preeminent force of phenotypic diversification. In recent years, a series of studies have analysed craniometric data in an explicitly quantitative genetic framework, which emphasises the importance of neutral forces such as migration, gene flow and genetic drift in creating global patterns of phenotypic diversity. This approach has revealed that global patterns of cranial variation can largely be explained on the basis of neutral theory. Therefore, human cranial data can be productively employed as a proxy for neutral genetic data in archaeological contexts. Moreover, there is a growing recognition that regions of the cranium differ in the extent to which they fit a neutral model of microevolutionary expectation, allowing for a more detailed assessment of patterns of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity within the human skull. Taking an historical perspective, the current state of knowledge regarding patterns of cranial adaptation in response to climatic and dietary effects is reviewed. Further insights will be gained by better incorporating the study of cranial and postcranial variation, as well as understanding the impact of neutral versus non-neutral evolution in creating amongspecies diversity patterns in primates more generally. However, this will most effectively be achieved when comparative anatomy studies are situated within an explicitly quantitative genetic evolutionary framework.","Adaptation; Cranial variation; Microevolution; Population history; Quantitative genetics","adaptation; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; climate; evolution; feeding behavior; human; phenotype; physical anthropology; physiology; population genetics; skull; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Biological Evolution; Cephalometry; Climate; Food Habits; Genetics, Population; Humans; Phenotype; Skull",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895168539

Specifically, two hypotheses were tested: 1) The ""basicranial hypothesis"" predicts that the endochondrally ossifying basicranium will be more reliable for reconstructing population history than intramembranously ossifying regions of the human cranium. This is based on the assumption that early ossification of the basicranium and its distinct functional constraints produce a cranial structure that is relatively immune to non-neutral evolutionary forces. 2) The ""single function hypothesis"" predicts that cranial regions associated with a single (sensory) function are less reliable indicators of neutral genetic history. Here the prediction is based on the logic that complex, multi-functional, integrated cranial regions are less likely toexhibit homoplasy and, therefore, provide a more accurate morphological proxy for genetic relationships. The congruence between craniometric affinity matrices and neutral genetic population matrices based on autosomal microsatellite and classical markers was assessed using a series of Mantel and Dow-Cheverud tests. The results did not support the predictions of the ""basicranial hypothesis,"" as the endochondrally ossifying basicranium was not significantly more congruent with the genetic data than intramembraneously ossifying modules. Moreover, although the results provided some support for the ""single function hypothesis,"" defining cranial modules on the basis of anatomical or functional complexity did not provide a consistent means of predicting their phylogenetic efficacy. These results have important implications for building an accurate inference model of cranial evolution in the human fossil record. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Advances in molecular genetics are helping to clarify how epigenetic factors influence the spatial and temporal regulation of the complex processes involved in odontogenesis. At the phenotypic level, the development of sophisticated systems for image analysis is enabling new dental phenotypes to be defined. The 2D and 3D data that are generated by these imaging systems can then be analysed with mathematical approaches, such as geometric morphometric analysis. By gathering phenotypic data and DNA from twins, it is now possible to use 'genome-wide' association studies and the monozygotic co-twin design to identify important genes in odontogenesis and also to clarify how epigenetic and environmental factors can affect this process. Given that many of the common dental anomalies affecting the human dentition are interrelated, apparently reflecting pleiotropic genetic effects, the discoveries and new directions described in this paper should have important implications for clinical dental practice in the future. © 2011 The Society of The Nippon Dental University.","Epigenetics; Genes; Phenomics; Teeth; Twins","dentition; embryo induction; epigenetics; genetics; genotype environment interaction; histology; human; odontometry; physiology; review; signal transduction; tooth; tooth development; twins; Dentition; Embryonic Induction; Epigenomics; Gene-Environment Interaction; Humans; Odontogenesis; Odontometry; Signal Transduction; Tooth; Twin Studies as Topic",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855903732

The ultimate results of these developments, according to many authorities, were the dispersals of Austroasiatic and Austronesian-speaking peoples into Mainland and Island Southeast Asia. New archaeological discoveries suggest that some of the earliest pottery in the world also occurred in southern China. Therefore, the historical significance of this region cannot be overlooked. This paper provides a brief review of cultural developments and settlement histories in southern China from the early Neolithic (c. 11,000-8000 b.c.) to the terminal Neolithic (2000 b.c.). Geographically, we examine the middle and lower Yangtze alluvial plain, the Lingnan (southern Nanling Mountains) and Fujian region, and the Yungui Plateau of southern China. Against the backdrop of the waxing and waning of Neolithic cultures in the Yangtze Valley we plot the spread of material culture, rice farming and animal domestication out of the Yangtze region to the Lingnan-Fujian region and the Yungui Plateau, and later into Taiwan and Southeast Asia. This study suggests that the origins of rice agriculture and the process of farming dispersal were more complicated than previously assumed. © 2008.","Dispersal; Farming; Migration; Neolithic; Southern china; Yangtze alluvial plain","agricultural ecosystem; alluvial plain; archaeology; cultural history; developmental biology; dispersal; historical perspective; island; language; migration; Neolithic; origin of life; paddy farming; plateau; settlement history; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Animalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-67651229441

Here, we estimate recombination breakpoints in admixed genomes based on genome-wide SNP data and date the genetic admixture between populations of Asian vs. Papuan ancestry in Eastern Indonesia. Analyses of two genome-wide datasets indicate an eastward progression of the Asian admixture signal in Eastern Indonesia beginning about 4,000-3,000 y ago, which is in excellent agreement with inferences based on Austronesian languages. The average rate of spread of Asian genes in Eastern Indonesia was about 0.9 km/y.

Although the origin of the diachronic morphological diversity seen on the continents is still debated, the distinct morphology of early Americans is well documented and widely dispersed. This morphology has been described extensively for South America, where larger samples are available. Here we test the hypotheses that the morphology of Early Americans results from retention of the morphological pattern of Late Pleistocene modern humans and that the occupation of the New World precedes the morphological differentiation that gave rise to recent Eurasian and American morphology. We compare Early American samples with European Upper Paleolithic skulls, the East Asian Zhoukoudian Upper Cave specimens and a series of 20 modern human reference crania. Canonical Analysis and Minimum Spanning Tree were used to assess the morphological affinities among the series, while Mantel and Dow-Cheverud tests based on Mahalanobis Squared Distances were used to test different evolutionary scenarios. Our results show strong morphological affinities among the early series irrespective of geographical origin, which together with the matrix analyses results favor the scenario of a late morphological differentiation of modern humans. We conclude that the geographic differentiation of modern human morphology is a late phenomenon that occurred after the initial settlement of the Americas.

Shape refers to the boundary outline independently from its orientation, relation to reference planes, and dimension (or size). Shape and its changes could be quantified by mathematical methods such as the Fourier series. In this investigation, Fourier analysis has been used to quantify the morphologic characteristics (size and shape) of the outline of the occlusal surface and maximum circumference (equator) in 259 normal, healthy human first permanent maxillary and mandibular molars and to assess the effect of sex. Large within-group variability was found in the Fourier coefficients. Both equatorial and occlusal molar areas were on average larger in male than in female homologous teeth, but the difference was statistically significant only for the equatorial areas. The mean ratios between equatorial and occlusal dental areas were independent from arch (maxillary and mandibular), side, or sex. Both equatorial and occlusal outlines of left and right homologous molars within sex and arch were similar, without size and shape differences. Similarly, no sex differences in shape were found in the comparison of homologous teeth. The method used in the present study could supply information about dental shape in both its entirety and local variations. In particular, the method is extremely sensitive to local variations in dental shape, and it could be usefully employed to compare single teeth to a standard.","Form; Harmonic analysis; Human first molar; Morphometry","article; Fourier analysis; human; mathematical model; molar tooth; morphometrics; reference value; sex difference; statistical analysis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032977878

Using a battery of 21 nonmetric dental traits we examine 7,247 individuals representing 58 samples drawn from East and Southeast Asian populations inhabiting the region from the late Pleistocene, through the Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and into the historic and modern periods. The chief data reduction technique is a neighbor-joining tree generated from the triangular matrix of mean measure of divergence values. Principal findings indicated a major dichotomization of the dataset into (1) an early Southeast Asian sample with close affinities to modern Australian and Melanesian populations and (2) a very distinct grouping of ancient and modern Northeast Asians. Distinct patterns of clinal variation among Neolithic and post-Neolithic Mainland Southeast Asian samples suggest a center to periphery spread of genes into the region from Northeast Asia. This pattern is consistent with archaeological and linguistic evidence for demic diffusion that accompanied agriculturally driven population expansion in the Neolithic. Later Metal Age affinities between Island and Mainland coastal populations with Northeast Asian series is likely a consequence of a South China Sea interaction sphere operating from at least 500 BCE, if not from the Neolithic. Such results provide extensive support for the two-layer hypothesis to account for the population history of the region.

Its colonisation about 50,000 years ago can therefore be considered the first true hominin 'migration' as opposed to the 'dispersals' that happened before it. To the hominins that occupied Sunda before Sahul was colonised by anatomically modern people, the water crossing must have been a barrier. It has been argued that it was the capacity for complex communication associated with modern cognition that allowed this barrier to be transgressed but, why did people use this capacity to build boats and what was the legacy of the associated technology in the subsequent colonisation? The particular maritime physical environment of Wallacea must have been an important factor in this process. Fibre technology, which must have accompanied the mariners who arrived in Sahul, must have played an important role in the continent's colonisation. This aspect of technology is often ignored in discussions about Sahul Pleistocene technology that suggest its simplicity compared to other regions. © 2011.",,"colonization; hominid; human settlement; Pleistocene; settlement history; Australia; Wallacea; Gabaza",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872144172

However, some aspects concerning the population affinities among early and modern Asians and Native Americans remain controversial. Specifically, contradictory views based mainly on partial evidence such as skull morphology or molecular genetics have led to hypotheses such as the ""Two Waves/Components"" and ""Single Wave"" or ""Out of Beringia"" model, respectively. Alternatively, an integrative scenario considering both morphological and molecular variation has been proposed and named as the ""Recurrent Gene Flow"" hypothesis. This scenario considers a single origin for all the Native Americans, and local, within-continent evolution plus the persistence of contact among Circum-Arctic groups. Here we analyze 2D geometric morphometric data to evaluate the associations between observed craniometric distance matrix and different geographic design matrices reflecting distinct scenarios for the peopling of the New World using basic and partial Mantel tests. Additionally, we calculated the rate of morphological differentiation between Early and Late American samples under the different settlement scenarios and compared our findings to the predicted morphological differentiation under neutral conditions. Also, we incorporated in our analyses some variants of the classical Single Wave and Two Waves models as well as the Recurrent Gene Flow model. Our results suggest a better explanatory performance of the Recurrent Gene Flow model, and provide additional insights concerning affinities among Asian and Native American Circum-Arctic groups.

Thus far, archaeological study and the analysis of modern and ancient European DNA have yielded inconclusive results regarding these hypotheses. Here we test these ideas using an extensive craniometric dataset representing 30 hunter-gatherer and farming populations. Pairwise population craniometric distance was compared with temporally controlled geographical models representing evolutionary hypotheses of biological and cultural transmission. The results show that, following the physical dispersal of Near Eastern/Anatolian farmers into central Europe, two biological lineages were established with limited gene flow between them. Farming communities spread across Europe, while hunter-gatherer communities located in outlying geographical regions adopted some cultural elements from the farmers. Therefore, the transition to farming in Europe did not involve the complete replacement of indigenous hunter-gatherer populations despite significant gene flow from the Southwest Asia. This study suggests that a mosaic process of dispersal of farmers and their ideas was operating in outlying regions of Europe, thereby reconciling previously conflicting results obtained from genetic and archaeological studies. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Craniometrics; Cultural diffusion; Demic diffusion; Demography; Neolithic transition","acculturation; agricultural change; archaeology; cranium; data set; demography; dispersal; farmers attitude; farming system; gene flow; geographical region; hunter-gatherer; hypothesis testing; indigenous population; mitochondrial DNA; Neolithic; Asia; Central Europe",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052246122

The objective is to see if the transition from sedentary, foraging, coastally oriented economies to centralized chiefdoms with attendant development and intensification of agriculture, trade, metal technologies, warfare, and population increase was accompanied by an emergence of and/or increase in infectious disease. It was found that skeletal evidence for infectious disease was absent in the Mid-Holocene, while over 10% of the Metal period sample exhibited lesions consistent with either infectious disease or immune system disorders. Factors potentially contributing to the emergence of infectious disease in northern Vietnam in the Metal period include: increased contact with bacterial or fungal pathogens either directly or by way of vertebrate and/or arthropod vectors; higher levels of debilitation and/or decreased levels of immunocompetence in the Metal period; and evolution of pathogens present in Mid-Holocene human hosts into more virulent forms in the Metal period.

We also showed that Senoi and Proto-Malay may be admixtures between Negrito and EA populations. Formal admixture tests provided evidence of gene flow between Austro-Asiatic-speaking OAs and populations from Southeast Asia (SEA) and South China which suggest a widespread presence of these people in SEA before Austronesian expansion. Elevated linkage disequilibrium (LD) and enriched homozygosity found in OAs reflectisolation and bottlenecks experienced. Estimates basedon N<inf>e</inf> and LD indicatedthat these populations diverged from East Asians during the late Pleistocene (14.5 to 8 KYA). The continuum in divergence time from Negritos to Senoi and Proto-Malay in combination with ancestral markers provides evidences of multiple waves of migration into SEA starting with the first Out-of-Africa dispersals followed by Early Train and subsequent Austronesian expansions. © The Author(s) 2015.

The “out-of-Taiwan” model proposes a major Late Holocene expansion of Neolithic Austronesian speakers from Taiwan. An alternative, proposing that Late Glacial/postglacial sea-level rises triggered largely autochthonous dispersals, accounts for some otherwise enigmatic genetic patterns, but fails to explain the Austronesian language dispersal. Combining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome and genome-wide data, we performed the most comprehensive analysis of the region to date, obtaining highly consistent results across all three systems and allowing us to reconcile the models. We infer a primarily common ancestry for Taiwan/ISEA populations established before the Neolithic, but also detected clear signals of two minor Late Holocene migrations, probably representing Neolithic input from both Mainland Southeast Asia and South China, via Taiwan. This latter may therefore have mediated the Austronesian language dispersal, implying small-scale migration and language shift rather than large-scale expansion. © 2016, The Author(s).",,"mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial DNA; ancestry group; Article; Austronesian people; China; cultural factor; genetic variability; genome; haplogroup; human; language; Late Holocene; migration; mitochondrial genome; Neolithic; priority journal; Southeast Asia; Taiwan; Y chromosome; Asian continental ancestry group; biological model; female; gene locus; genetic association study; genetic database; genetics; human genome; male; phylogeny; phylogeography; reproducibility; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asia, Southeastern; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Chromosomes, Human, Y; Databases, Genetic; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Loci; Genome, Human; Humans; Male; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Phylogeography; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958777413

The orthodox view is that Neolithic farmers spread south by sea from mainland China to Taiwan and thence to Island Southeast Asia, taking with them a new material culture and domestic rice and pigs and speaking the precursor of the Austronesian languages that are spoken in the region today. Opponents of this 'farming/language dispersal' theory have proposed models of acculturation, in which foragers acquired new material culture and food resources by trading with farmers. However, new work in archaeology, palaeoecology, palynology and anthropology, especially in Borneo, and in genetics and linguistics for the region as a whole, is suggesting that foraging/farming transitions in Southeast Asia were far more complex than either of these opposing 'grand narratives' of discontinuity (population colonisation) or continuity (acculturation) allows. Through the course of the Early/Mid-Holocene new material culture, technologies and foods were variously taken up, promoted or resisted in order to provision changes in the social and ideological constitution of societies. Whilst new readings of the data for foraging-farming transitions in the region vary, a consensus is emerging that it is more useful to focus on how materials and modes of life were used to underwrite changes in social networks than to seek to explain the archaeological record in terms of migrating farmers or acculturating foragers. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Borneo; Early farming; Foraging; Hunter-gatherers; Island Southeast Asia; Niah Caves",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876903033

However a rapid migration out of Africa into Southeast Asia by at least 60 ka is supported by archaeological, paleogenetic and paleoanthropological data. Recent discoveries in Laos, a modern human cranium (TPL1) from Tam Pa Ling 's cave, provided the first evidence for the presence of early modern humans in mainland Southeast Asia by 63-46 ka. In the current study, a complete human mandible representing a second individual, TPL 2, is described using discrete traits and geometric morphometrics with an emphasis on determining its population affinity. The TPL2 mandible has a chin and other discrete traits consistent with early modern humans, but it retains a robust lateral corpus and internal corporal morphology typical of archaic humans across the Old World. The mosaic morphology of TPL2 and the fully modern human morphology of TPL1 suggest that a large range of morphological variation was present in early modern human populations residing in the eastern Eurasia by MIS 3.",,"Article; bone age; controlled study; fossil human; geometry; human; human tissue; Laos; mandible; morphological trait; morphometrics; anatomy and histology; fossil; physical anthropology; Anthropology, Physical; Fossils; Humans; Laos; Mandible",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928911370

In contrast, East Asia has so far received little attention, despite representing a core region at which the Neolithic transition took place independently ~3 millennia after its onset in the Near East. We report genome-wide data from two hunter-gatherers from Devil’s Gate, an early Neolithic cave site (dated to ~7.7 thousand years ago) located in East Asia, on the border between Russia and Korea. Both of these individuals are genetically most similar to geographically close modern populations from the Amur Basin, all speaking Tungusic languages, and, in particular, to the Ulchi. The similarity to nearby modern populations and the low levels of additional genetic material in the Ulchi imply a high level of genetic continuity in this region during the Holocene, a pattern that markedly contrasts with that reported for Europe. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved;",,"Core region; East Asia; Eurasia; Genetic materials; Holocenes; Genes; ectodysplasin receptor; guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HERC2 protein, human; mitochondrial DNA; archeology; chemistry; Far East; genetics; genotype; human; human genome; phenotype; principal component analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; Archaeology; DNA, Mitochondrial; Far East; Genome, Human; Genotype; Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; Humans; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Principal Component Analysis; Receptors, Ectodysplasin",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020941932

This study aimed to establish how well the method could be expected to perform (in its standard form) when used on surfaces from a variety of tooth types and, in particular, how much impact inconsistencies in the positioning of landmarks would have on investigations of shape. Using four different operators' images and landmarks from 10 different surfaces from each of 20 patients, the consequences of location inconsistency are evaluated by calculating its effect on the recorded variation in Procrustes fits, obtained for each set of multiple representations. The proportion of variation in shape attributable to actual differences between patients, rather than other sources of error, ranged from only 36 to 65% for the five buccal-surfaces considered and was no more than 30% for any of the five occlusal surfaces. Further examination of these results indicated that consistent orientation differences before imaging might be a particular source of error in obtaining any occlusal-landmark data, as might location ambiguities around the edges of the teeth. Orientation effects were also suggested for the buccal-surfaces of the molar teeth. In contrast, the relatively flatter buccal-surfaces of the incisors and canines produced the most reliable data. Methods of analysis need to accommodate these problems if landmark data are to be used to describe variations in tooth shape. Different surfaces each present their own particular difficulties and so a variety of solutions may be required. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Broadly defined as ""small-bodied Homo sapiens"" (compared with neighboring populations), their origins and the nature of the processes involved in the maintenance of their phenotype over time are highly debated. Major results have been recently obtained from population genetics on present-day negrito populations, but their evolutionary history remains largely unresolved. We present and discuss the Upper Pleistocene human remains recovered from Tabon Cave and Callao Cave in the Philippines, which are potentially highly relevant to these research questions. Human fossils have been recovered in large numbers from Tabon Cave (Palawan Island) but mainly from reworked and mixed sediments from several archaeological layers. We review and synthesize the long and meticulous collaborative work done on the archives left from the 1960s excavations and on the field. The results demonstrate the long history of human occupations in the cave, since at least ~30,000 BP. The examination of the Tabon human remains shows a large variability: large and robust for one part of the sample, and small and gracile for the other part. The latter would fit quite comfortably within the range of variation of Philippine negritos. Farther north, on Luzon Island, the human third metatarsal recently recovered from Callao Cave and dated to ~66,000 BP is now the oldest direct evidence of human presence in the Philippines. Previous data show that, compared with H. sapiens (including Philippine negritos), this bone presents a very small size and several unusual morphological characteristics. We present a new analytical approach using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics for comparing the Callao fossil to a wide array of extant Asian mammals, including nonhuman primates and H. sapiens. The results demonstrate that the shape of the Callao metatarsal is definitely closer to humans than to any other groups. The fossil clearly belongs to the genus Homo; however, it remains at the margin of the variation range of H. sapiens. Because of its great antiquity and the presence of another diminutive species of the genus Homo in the Wallace area during this time period (H. floresiensis), we discuss here in detail the affinities and potential relatedness of the Callao fossil with negritos that are found today on Luzon Island. © 2013 Wayne State University Press.","Callao cave; Homo sapiens; Philippines; Small body-size; Tabon cave; Upper pleistocene","animal; archeology; Asian continental ancestry group; ethnology; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; genetics; hominid; human; phenotype; Philippines; physical anthropology; population dynamics; population genetics; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Archaeology; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biological Evolution; Fossils; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Hominidae; Humans; Phenotype; Philippines; Population Dynamics",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026451491

Previous analyses of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and Early Neolithic farmers suggest that cranial shape variation preserves the population history signature of the Neolithic transition. However, the extent to which these same demographic processes are discernible in the postcranium is poorly understood. Here, for the first time, crania and postcranial elements from the same 11 prehistoric populations are analysed together in an internally consistent theoretical and methodological framework. Results show that while cranial shape reflects the population history differences between Mesolithic and Neolithic lineages, relative limb dimensions exhibit significant congruence with environmental variables such as latitude and temperature, even after controlling for geography and time. Also, overall limb size is found to be consistently larger in hunter-gatherers than farmers, suggesting a reduction in size related to factors other than thermoregulatory adaptation. Therefore, our results suggest that relative limb dimensions are not tracking the same demographic population history as the cranium, and point to the strong influence of climatic, dietary and behavioural factors in determining limb morphology, irrespective of underlying neutral demographic processes. © 2013 The Author(s).","Agricultural transition; Cranium; Natural selection; Plasticity; Population history; Postcranium","agricultural change; cranium; cultural change; demographic history; environmental factor; hunter-gatherer; limb; Mesolithic; natural selection; Neolithic; thermoregulation; Europe; Crania; agriculture; anatomy and histology; archeology; bones of the arm and hand; clavicle; demography; Europe; evolution; human; leg; skull; Agriculture; Archaeology; Arm Bones; Biological Evolution; Clavicle; Demography; Europe; Humans; Leg Bones; Skull",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896059343

Our study aims to: (i) detect morphological differences that may indicate several migrations; (ii) test for the presence of genetic isolation; and (iii) test the correlation between shape data and competing settlement hypotheses by taking into account geography, chronology, climate effects, the presence of genetic isolation and recurrent gene flow.METHODS: We analyzed a large sample of three-dimensional (3D) cranial surface scans (803 specimens) including past and modern groups from America and Australasia. Shape variation was investigated using geometric morphometrics. Differential external gene flow was evaluated by applying genetic concepts to morphometric data (Relethford-Blangero approach). Settlement hypotheses were tested using a matrix correlation approach (Mantel tests).RESULTS: Our results highlight the strong dichotomy between Circum-Arctic and continental Amerindians as well as the impact of climate adaptation, and possibly recurrent gene flow in the Circum-Arctic area. There is also evidence for the impact of genetic isolation on phenetic variation in Baja California. Several settlement hypotheses are correlated with our data.CONCLUSIONS: The three approaches used in this study highlight the importance of local processes especially in Baja California, and caution against the use of overly simplistic models when searching for the number of migration events. The results stress the complexity of the settlement of the Americas as well as the mosaic nature of the processes involved in this process. Am. J. Hum.

In Europe, the LGM may have played a role in changing morphological features as a result of adaptive and stochastic processes. We use craniometric data to examine morphological diversity in pre- and post-LGM specimens. Craniometric variation is assessed across four periods - pre-LGM, late glacial, Early Holocene and Middle Holocene - using a large, well-dated, data set. Our results show significant differences across the four periods, using a MANOVA on size-adjusted cranial measurements. A discriminant function analysis shows separation between pre-LGM and later groups. Analyses repeated on a subsample, controlled for time and location, yield similar results. The results are largely influenced by facial measurements and are most consistent with neutral demographic processes. These findings suggest that the LGM had a major impact on AMH populations in Europe prior to the Neolithic. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, there is disagreement on whether certain parts of the cranium preserve this signature to a greater degree than other parts. It is also unclear how different quantitative measures of phenotype affect the association of genetic variation and anatomy. Here, we revisit these matters by testing the correlation of genetic distances and various phenotypic distances for ten modern human populations. Materials and Methods: Geometric morphometric shape data from the crania of adult individuals (n = 224) are used to calculate phenotypic PST, Procrustes, and Mahalanobis distances. We calculate their correlation to neutral genetic distances, FST, derived from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We subset the cranial data into landmark configurations that include the neurocranium, the face, and the temporal bone in order to evaluate whether these cranial regions are differentially correlated to neutral genetic variation. Results: Our results show that PST, Mahalanobis, and Procrustes distances are correlated with FST distances to varying degrees. They indicate that overall cranial shape is significantly correlated with neutral genetic variation. Of the component parts examined, PST distances for both the temporal bone and the face have a stronger association with FST distances than the neurocranium. When controlling for population divergence time, only the whole cranium and the temporal bone have a statistically significant association with FST distances. Discussion: Our results confirm that the cranium, as a whole, and the temporal bone can be used to reconstruct modern human population history. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","geometric morphometrics; population genetics; quantitative genetics; SNPs","adult; anatomy; gene mutation; genetic distance; genetic variation; human; major clinical study; morphometrics; quantitative genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; temporal bone; validation process; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; female; genetics; genomics; male; physical anthropology; population genetics; procedures; reproducibility; single nucleotide polymorphism; skull; standards; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Female; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reproducibility of Results; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994509663

Here, we investigate the factors responsible for dental variation among human populations from southern South America. The aim of this work is to test the correspondence of dental size and shape variation with geographical, molecular (i.e. mtDNA) and ecological (i.e. climate, diet and food preparation) variables employing comparative phylogenetic methods, which have not previously been extensively applied at a within-species level. The results of the Procrustes analysis show a significant association of shape variables with molecular distance and geography, whereas dental size is not associated with molecular or geographical distances among groups. Phylogenetic generalized leastsquares analysis, which takes into account the evolutionary autocorrelation among populations, shows a significant relationship between dental size variation and diet, while temperature and pottery do not correspond with dental size or shape. Specifically, groups with diets rich in carbohydrates, as well as the maritime hunter-gatherers, have the smallest teeth. In summary, our results support ecological factors as the dominant factor on dental size diversification in this region, while evolutionary relationships account for variation in dental shape. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Dental size and shape; Diet; Phylogenetic comparative method; Pottery; Temperature","dentition; diet; divergence; environmental factor; geographical variation; hominid; least squares method; morphology; phylogenetics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950823835

Geoarchaeological science is widely employed in many regions of the world to contextualise archaeological material and provide an environmental backdrop against which to explore archaeological narratives. However, in Southeast Asia there is an apparent lag in the routine use of this Earth-Science approach despite the abundance of archaeological sites important in explicating past hominin dispersals to and from the region. In this review of the state-of-the-art of geoarchaeological research in Southeast Asia, I examine the role of the discipline in addressing the important issues in archaeology today. I identify where geoarchaeology is being used and to what effect, highlighting gaps in the geoarchaeological dataset. From a methodological point of view it is imperative that archaeologists and geoarchaeologists working in Southeast Asia (and other humid tropical regions of the world) fully appreciate how to interpret the geoarchaeological signatures associated with this climate regime so that methods and practice can be refined. A series of steps that will serve to drive forward geoarchaeological research in the region are also proposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Colonisation; Dispersal; Geoarchaeology; Hominin; Homo sapiens; Review; Southeast Asia","archaeology; colonization; dispersal; hominid; Pleistocene; Southeast Asia; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996969485

Despite this consensus, several questions remain with regard to the mode and timing of dispersal out of the continent. Competing models differ primarily by the number of dispersals, their geographic route, and the extent to which expanding modern humans interacted with other hominins. Central in this debate is whether Southeast Asia was occupied significantly earlier than other parts of Eurasia and, if so, whether the population ancestral to extant Southeast Asians was notably different from the ancestors of extant Eurasians. Here, genetic and fossil evidence for the dispersal process out of Africa and into Asia is reviewed. A scenario that can resolve the current archaeological, genetic, and paleontological evidence is one which considers an initial expansion of anatomically modern humans into the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant during the terminal Middle Pleistocene, with continued exchange with Africans until the Late Pleistocene, when modern humans then dispersed into Eurasia in two waves. Advances in population genomics and methods applying evolutionary theory to the fossil record will serve to further clarify modern human origins and the out-of-Africa process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Genomics; Out-of-Africa; Paleoanthropology; Southeast Asia; Southern route","anthropology; archaeology; evolutionary theory; fossil record; genetic analysis; genomics; hominid; Africa; Arabian Peninsula; Asia; Eurasia; Levant; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969916831

We previously addressed this question using founder analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region sequences to identify major lineage clusters most likely to have dispersed from Taiwan into ISEA, proposing that the dispersal had a relatively minor impact on the extant genetic structure of ISEA, and that the role of agriculture in the expansion of the Austronesian languages was therefore likely to have been correspondingly minor. Here we test these conclusions by sequencing whole mtDNAs from across Taiwan and ISEA, using their higher chronological precision to resolve the overall proportion that participated in the “out-of-Taiwan” mid-Holocene dispersal as opposed to earlier, postglacial expansions in the Early Holocene. We show that, in total, about 20 % of mtDNA lineages in the modern ISEA pool result from the “out-of-Taiwan” dispersal, with most of the remainder signifying earlier processes, mainly due to sea-level rises after the Last Glacial Maximum. Notably, we show that every one of these founder clusters previously entered Taiwan from China, 6–7 ka, where rice-farming originated, and remained distinct from the indigenous Taiwanese population until after the subsequent dispersal into ISEA. © 2016, The Author(s).",,"mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial DNA; Article; Austronesian people; cladistics; DNA sequence; genetic variability; haplogroup; Holocene; human; inheritance; Neolithic; nucleotide sequence; phylogeography; population dispersal; population migration; priority journal; Southeast Asia; Taiwan; Taiwanese; Taiwanese Aborigine; female; founder effect; genetics; genome imprinting; Asia, Southeastern; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Founder Effect; Genomic Imprinting; Humans; Taiwan",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957947895

Genome-wide data are particularly useful for inferring migrations, admixture, and fine structure, as well as for estimating population divergence and admixture times and fluctuations in effective population sizes. In this review, we highlight some of the stories that have emerged from the analyses of genome-wide SNP genotyping data concerning the human history of Southern Africa, India, Oceania, Island South East Asia, Europe and the Americas and comment on possible future study directions. We also discuss advantages and drawbacks of using SNP-arrays, with a particular focus on the ascertainment bias, and ways to circumvent it. © Pugach and Stoneking.","Ascertainment bias; Demographic history; Genome-wide data","ancestry group; ascertainment bias; Austronesian people; Bantu people; demography; Europe; gene flow; gene frequency; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic distance; genetic drift; genetic variability; genotype; geographic origin; heredity; human; human genome; India; Khoisan; migration; Pacific islands; population dispersal; population genetic structure; population size; priority journal; Review; Romani (people); single nucleotide polymorphism; South Africa; Southeast Asia; Western Hemisphere",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925857970

Here, we proposed to evaluate the suitability of two-dimensional crown contour shape analysis in achieving this objective. The method was tested separately on 180 first and second maxillary molars (UM) and 180 first and second mandibular molars (LM) securely identified (in anatomical position in their sockets). Generalized Procrustes superimposition is used to normalize the outlines prior to applying elliptic Fourier analyses (""EFAproc"" method). Reliability and effectiveness of this morphometric procedure was evaluated by comparing the results obtained for the same dataset with four other morphometric methods of contour analysis. Cross-validated (""leave one individual out"") percentages of misclassification yielded by linear discriminant analyses were used for determining the anatomic position of modern human molars. The percentages of misclassifications obtained from every method of contour analysis were low (1.67% to 3.33% for the UM, 5.56% to 6.67% for the LM) indicating the high suitability of crown contour analyses in correctly identifying molars. A reliable protocol, based on predictive linear discriminant analyses, was then proposed for identification of isolated molars. In addition, our results confirmed that the EFAproc method is suitable for normalizing outlines prior to undertaking elliptic Fourier analyses, especially in the case of nearly circular outlines: it obtained better classification than the classic method of normalization of Fourier descriptors for UM and provided also some advantages over the three landmarks-based methods tested here. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","contour shape analysis; geometric morphometrics; normalization; tooth recognition","algorithm; anatomical concepts; article; clinical classification; elliptic fourier analysis; Fourier analysis; generalized procrustes analysis; human; information processing; mandible; maxilla; measurement error; molar tooth; morphometrics; normal human; standardization; tooth crown; contour shape analysis; geometric morphometrics; normalization; tooth recognition; Anthropology, Physical; Fossils; Fourier Analysis; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Models, Statistical; Molar; Odontometry; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892577862

The comparative samples consist of prehistoric and early historic crania from the lower Yangtze River basin, together with recent cranial series from Vietnam, Thailand, South China, and Australia. The results, based mainly on the measure of divergence, are as follows: (1) the early prehistoric northern Vietnam group is distinct from the subsequent inhabitants of northern Vietnam and neighboring populations; (2) the cranial series of northern Vietnam and the surrounding region from the late prehistoric to recent times through early historic period exhibit relative homogeneity, suggesting population continuity; (3) the recent Han Chinese from southern China, one of the possible representatives of East Asians, are relatively distant from all groups from the prehistoric age onwards; and (4) a clear separation of Aboriginal Australians from all the comparative samples, including the early prehistoric northern Vietnamese, is evident. These findings suggest partial support for the two opposing hypotheses, i.e. the two-layer model and the regional-continuity model, for the population history of Southeast Asians, at least, in the northern Vietnamese region. This may be further compatible with the recent hypothesis for modern human dispersals: an earlier out-of-Africa expansion of Australians than other contemporary Eurasians including Southeast Asians. © 2012 The Anthropological Society of Nippon.","Australia; East/Southeast Asia; Prehistoric northern Vietnam; Regional-continuity model; Two-layer model",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867919004

The published osteological material consists in one frontal bone and three mandibular fragments discovered during 1960 fieldworks as well as 11 new human remains unearthed during 2000–2001 excavations. However, recent efforts to recover and centralize the considerable amount of archaeological specimens and data from 1960s' excavations revealed that an unexpected huge number of human bone remains were excavated during this period. The collection, preserved in the National Museum of the Philippines, includes currently at least 483 human bone remains. We propose here a preliminary review of the anatomical representation of the human bones from this collection and a first large scale comparative morphometric analysis focusing on the crown dimensions of six permanent first upper molars (UM1). This first overview revealed an extreme fragmentation of the bones of the collection resulting in a poorly indicative MNI. From the bones bearing sufficient diagnostic morphology, few immature individuals are present in the assemblage. Refitting of specimens and observation of broken surfaces indicated that ancient human activity in the cave (anterior to the excavation) was likely to be an important taphonomic factor of fragmentation of the assemblage. Our comparative analysis, including 339 UM1, revealed that two UM1 from Tabon Cave have unusual large dimensions, outside the range of variation of submodern Southeast Asians (SEAn) molars of our sample. Four other UM1 from Tabon fall in – or close to – the variability of the Philippines Negritos. We show also that the morphological disparity encountered among the UM1 from Tabon Cave is higher than in other archaeological sites and submodern populations of our sample. This confirms previous publications that emphasized important morphological variations and proposed the hypothesis of the presence of two morphotypes. Although chrono-stratigraphic information is lacking because of the disturbed stratigraphic context in which almost the totality of the bones was unearthed, unpublished reports and field documents show that Robert Fox (head of the 1960s' excavations) considered that an important part of this collection might have a Pleistocene age. Given the scarcity of the Pleistocene Homo sapiens fossil record in island Southeast Asia (SEA), part of this collection might improve significantly our knowledge of the morphological relatedness and variability of the Upper Pleistocene Homo sapiens in the region. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Dental morphometrics; Early settlements; Fossil Homo sapiens; Philippines; Southeast Asia; Upper Pleistocene","anthropogenic effect; archaeological evidence; bone; cave system; fossil record; hominid; human settlement; morphology; morphometry; Pleistocene; taphonomy; tooth; Philippines; Southeast Asia; Tabon Cave; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951766648

According to the recent African origin (RAO) model, modern humans subsequently arose in Africa, around 250 thousand years ago, and began dispersing from Africa to the rest of the world around 60-90 thousand years ago. The multiregional evolution (MRE) model instead holds that a panmictic population of archaic hominins, distributed throughout the entire Old World, evolved in concert to become modern humans, without any major recent exodus from Africa or any other region in the world. Admixture between modern humans and non-African archaic hominins could be signified by genes in non-African populations that show divergence times earlier than those found between African and non-African populations. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
