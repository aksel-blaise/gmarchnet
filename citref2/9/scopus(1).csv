Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites.

These questions are interesting to practitioners as well as theoreticians, because the small-sample effects can easily contaminate the design and evaluation of a proposed system. For applications with a large number of features and a complex classification rule, the training sample size must be quite large. A large test sample is required to accurately evaluate a classifier with a low error rate. The design of a pattern recognition system consists of several stages: Data collection, formation of the pattern classes, feature selection, specification of the classification algorithm, and estimation of the classification error. In this paper, we will discuss the effects of sample size on feature selection and error estimation for several types of classifier. In addition to surveying prior work in this area, our emphasis is on giving practical advice to today's designers and users of statistical pattern recognition systems. © 1991 IEEE","Classification error; classifier design; curse of dimensionality; feature selection; statistical pattern recognition; test samples; training samples","Image Processing - Image Analysis; Mathematical Statistics; Probability; Classification Error; Classifier Design; Feature Selection; Multinomial Classifier; Statistical Pattern Recognition; Training Samples; Pattern Recognition",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026120032

Most of this change has been due to the development and adoption of methods to analyze the Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks. These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption. We consider the implications of these findings in terms of the potential for these approaches in the study of comparative growth in related species.","Facial remodelling; Geometric morphometrics; Thin plate spline analysis","age; allometry; article; cercocebus; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; face growth; female; geometry; male; molar tooth; nonhuman; ontogeny; priority journal; sex difference; statistical model; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Anthropometry; Bone Remodeling; Cercocebus; Facial Bones; Female; Male; Models, Anatomic; Sex Characteristics; Cercocebus; Cercocebus torquatus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031724058

Overall, among-population differences in extant Homo sapiens cranial morphology are proportional to among-population differences in neutral molecular characteristics. For most of the populations studied, cranial morphology varies among regions in a manner consistent with neutral expectations. Removal of the effects of shared population history and structure by using the partial Mantel's test, however, does not remove the correlation between some aspects of cranial morphology and a measure of coldness of climate. The excess differentiation is most apparent in those population comparisons that involve a Siberian population living in an extremely cold environment. This finding suggests the action of natural selection, associated with regional variation in temperature, leading to among-population differentiation in excess of neutral expectations for some cranial dimensions. Those dimensions reflect the breadth of the skull, cranial vault size and shape, and aspects of nasal morphology.

Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors. Because different cranial regions preserve population history and climate signatures differentially, caution is suggested when using cranial anatomy for phylogenetic reconstruction. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Climate adaptation; Craniofacial morphology; Human variation; Neutral genetics; Population history","accuracy; article; climate; correlation analysis; evolution; face; female; genetic distance; geometry; history; human; human tissue; hypothesis; male; morphology; morphometrics; normal human; phylogeny; population research; priority journal; reliability; skull; temporal bone; Acclimatization; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Climate; Continental Population Groups; Evolution; Face; Female; Genetics, Population; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Phylogeny; Reproducibility of Results; Skull; Temporal Bone; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845396793

This review is the first systematic comparison of allometric methods in the context of geometric morphometrics that considers the structure of morphological spaces and their implications for characterizing allometry and performing size correction. The distinction of two main schools of thought is useful for understanding the differences and relationships between alternative methods for studying allometry. The Gould–Mosimann school defines allometry as the covariation of shape with size. This concept of allometry is implemented in geometric morphometrics through the multivariate regression of shape variables on a measure of size. In the Huxley–Jolicoeur school, allometry is the covariation among morphological features that all contain size information. In this framework, allometric trajectories are characterized by the first principal component, which is a line of best fit to the data points. In geometric morphometrics, this concept is implemented in analyses using either Procrustes form space or conformation space (the latter also known as size-and-shape space). Whereas these spaces differ substantially in their global structure, there are also close connections in their localized geometry. For the model of small isotropic variation of landmark positions, they are equivalent up to scaling. The methods differ in their emphasis and thus provide investigators with flexible tools to address specific questions concerning evolution and development, but all frameworks are logically compatible with each other and therefore unlikely to yield contradictory results. © 2016, The Author(s).","Allometry; Centroid size; Conformation; Form; Geometric morphometrics; Multivariate regression; Principal component analysis; Procrustes superimposition; Shape; Size correction","allometry; conformation; fluctuating asymmetry; genotype; geometry; growth curve; growth rate; morphometrics; multivariate analysis of covariance; priority journal; Review; anatomy; animal; body size; evolution; genetic variation; human; procedures; regression analysis; Anatomy; Animals; Biological Evolution; Body Size; Genetic Variation; Humans; Regression Analysis",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962146885

It aims to establish the extent to which the distinctive features of adult representatives of these populations are present in the early post natal period and to what extent population differences in ontogenetic scaling and allometric trajectories contribute to distinct facial forms. The analyses utilize configurations of facial landmarks and are carried out using geometric morphometric methods. The results of this study show that modern human populations can be distinguished based on facial shape alone, irrespective of age or sex, indicating the early presence of differences. Additionally, some populations have statistically distinct facial ontogenetic trajectories that lead to the development of further differences later in ontogeny. We conclude that population-specific facial morphologies develop principally through distinctions in facial shape probably already present at birth and further accentuated and modified to variable degrees during growth. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the plasticity of facial growth patterns in modern humans. Further, they have important implications in relation to the study of growth in the face of fossil hominins and in relation to the possibility of developing effective discriminant functions for the identification of population affinities of immature facial skeletal material. Such tools would be of value in archaeological, forensic and anthropological applications. The findings of this study underline the need to examine more deeply, and in more detail, the ontogenetic basis of other causes of craniometric variation, such as sexual dimorphism and hominin species differentiation.","Allometric vectors; Craniofacial variation; Facial ontogeny","adolescent; adult; allometry; anthropology; archeology; article; controlled study; craniofacial development; craniofacial morphology; craniometry; face; face growth; facial bone; female; forensic medicine; fossil; geometry; human; human experiment; male; normal human; perinatal period; plasticity; population differentiation; population research; priority journal; sex difference; species differentiation; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Continental Population Groups; Facial Bones; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maxillofacial Development; Morphogenesis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036737886

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549154351

Recent consensus views cranial morphology as largely indicative of population history in humans, with some anatomical cranial regions/measurements being more informative on population history, while others being under selection pressure. We test earlier findings using the largest and most diverse cranial dataset available as yet: 7,423 male specimens from 135 geographic human population samples represented by 33 standard craniometric linear measurements. We calculated Mahalanobis D 2 for three datasets: complete cranial dataset; facial measurement dataset; and neurocranial measurement dataset; these morphological distance matrices were then compared to matrices of geographic distances as well as of several climatic variables. Additionally, we calculated Fst values for our cranial measurements and compared the results to the expected Fst values for neutral genetic loci. Our findings support the hypothesis that cranial, and especially neurocranial morphology, is phylogenetically informative, and that aspects of the face and cranium are subject to selection related to climatic factors. The Fst analysis suggest that selection to climate is largely restricted to groups living in extremely cold environments, including Northeast Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, though each of these regions appears to have arrived at their morphology through distinct adaptive pathways. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Adaptation; Craniometrics; Fst; Human variation; Neanderthals; Population history","anatomical variation; article; climate; controlled study; data base; geography; human; human tissue; male; morphology; phylogeny; population; population differentiation; priority journal; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Asia; Cephalometry; Climate; Cold Climate; Europe; Evolution; Facial Bones; Fossils; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Male; North America; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Population; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449643229

The argument is based principally on the observation that nasal height is globally more variable than nasal breadth, with nasal breadth thus contributing little to variation in the index. This argument does not take into account the confounding effect of absolute size of these variables on their variances. In this study we compare the intrinsic variation in skeletal nasal height and breadth within and among 26 mixed‐sex populations (N = 2,408) at globally diverse localities (Howells, 1989), using 2 × 2 variance‐covariance matrices of the logarithmically transformed variates. Hypothesis tests for homogeneity of matrices and equalvariance/equal‐covariance indicate that the intrinsic variation in nasal breadth is greater than that for nasal height within populations, and that nasal breadth and nasal height exhibit equivalent intrinsic variation among populations. The argument that nasal breadth contributes little to the worldwide variation in the human nasal index is rejected. Given our present understanding of nasal physiological morpho‐function, these results support, but do not demonstrate, an adaptive role for human nasal index variation. Promising methods for elucidating natural selection on human nasal form are suggested.

In this study, we use virtual endocasts to provide a detailed description of shape changes during human postnatal ontogeny with geometric morphometric methods. Using CT scans of 108 dried human crania ranging in age from newborns to adults and several hundred landmarks and semi-landmarks, we find that the endocranial ontogenetic trajectory is curvilinear with two bends, separating three distinct phases of shape change. We test to what extent endocranial shape change is driven by size increase and whether the curved ontogenetic trajectory can be explained by a simple model of modular development of the endocranial base and the endocranial vault. The hypothesis that endocranial shape change is driven exclusively by brain growth is not supported; we find changes in endocranial shape after adult size has been attained and that the transition from high rates to low rates of size increase does not correspond to one of the shape trajectory bends. The ontogenetic trajectory of the endocranial vault analyzed separately is nearly linear; the trajectory of the endocranial base, in contrast, is curved. The endocranial vault therefore acts as one developmental module during human postnatal ontogeny. Our data suggest that the cranial base comprises several submodules that follow their own temporally and/or spatially disjunct growth trajectories. © Journal compilation © 2009 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Brain; Endocranium; Geometric morphometrics; Ontogeny; Semi-landmarks; Virtual endocasts","adolescent; adult; article; brain cortex; brain development; brain growth; brain size; child; computer assisted tomography; computer interface; controlled study; dura mater; human; human tissue; methodology; morphometrics; newborn; ontogeny; priority journal; skull; three dimensional imaging; Adolescent; Adult; Aging; Brain; Cephalometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Models, Anatomic; Skull; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult; Crania; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-69249217996

Why and how the biological race concept might work in forensic anthropology was contemplated by Sauer (Soc Sci Med 34 [1992] 107-111), who hypothesized that American forensic anthropologists are good at what they do because of a concordance between social race and skeletal morphology in American whites and blacks. However, Sauer also stressed that this concordance did not validate the classic biological race concept of physical anthropology that there are a relatively small number of discrete types of human beings. Results from Howells (Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 67 [1973] 1-259; Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 79 [1989] 1-189; Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology 82 [1995] 1-108) and others using craniometric and molecular data show strong geographic patterning of human variation despite overlap in their distributions. However, Williams et al. (Curr Anthropol 46 [2005] 340-346) concluded that skeletal morphology cannot be used to accurately classify individuals. Williams et al. cited additional support from Lewontin (Evol Biol 6 [1972] 381-398), who analyzed classic genetic markers. In this study, multivariate analyses of craniometric data support Sauer's hypothesis that there are morphological differences between American whites and blacks. We also confirm significant geographic patterning in human variation but also find differences among groups within continents. As a result, if biological races are defined by uniqueness, then there are a very large number of biological races that can be defined, contradicting the classic biological race concept of physical anthropology. Further, our results show that humans can be accurately classified into geographic origin using craniometrics even though there is overlap among groups.

The relative influence of these three factors has been argued in the literature, most recently in a series of articles debating the statistical and biological significance of Boas's immigration studies as they relate to cranial plasticity. The Boas debate is discussed within the broader context of debate over genetic and environmental influences on craniometric variation. Additional examples are provided from an ongoing study of global craniometric variation. Although developmental plasticity and climatic adaptation have had an impact on craniometric variation, these factors tend not to erase, or even obscure greatly, underlying patterns of population structure and history that fit a neutral model of quantitative variation.

We present and test three hypotheses about the factors contributing to craniodental variation in extant primate taxa, and then apply these results to the interpretation of the P. boisei hypodigm. Within the comparative samples of extant Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Colobus, variables from the cranial base, neurocranium, and face that are not subject to high magnitudes of strain have consistently lower levels of intraspecific variation than variables from regions of the face subject to high levels of strain.

P. boisei is found to have a low degree of variability relative to extant primates for variables shown to be generally useful for testing taxonomic hypotheses. Contrary to the claims of Suwa et al. ([1997] Nature 389:489-492), the recently discovered material from Konso falls within the range of variation of the ""pre-Konso"" hypodigm of P. boisei for available conventional metrical variables. Those aspects of the Konso material that appear to extend the range of the P. boisei hypodigm involve regions of the skull predicted to be prone to high levels of within-species variation. The approach used in this study focuses on craniodental data, but it is applicable to other regions of the skeleton. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Coefficient of variation; Craniodental; Paranthropus boisei; Species; Taxonomy","anatomical variation; article; craniofacial morphology; fossil; mechanical stress; nonhuman; primate; skull; strain difference; taxonomy; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Dentition; Female; Fossils; Male; Models, Theoretical; Primates; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034847413

However, investigators using DFA must account for (1) the possibility of correct classification due to chance alone, and (2) the influence of prior probabilities of group membership on classification results. A search of the recent otolith chemistry literature showed that these two concerns are sometimes ignored, so we used simulated data sets to explore the potential pitfalls of such oversights. We found that when estimating reclassification success for a training data set, small sample sizes or unbalanced sampling designs can produce remarkably high reclassification success rates by chance alone, especially when prior probabilities are estimated from sample size. When using a training data set to classify unknown individuals, maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions and group membership afforded up to 20% improvement over DFA with uninformative priors when groups contributed to the sample unequally. Given these results, we recommend the use of (1) randomization tests to estimate the probability that reclassification success is better than random, and (2) maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions in place of uninformative priors. © Inter-Research 2007.","Classification; Discriminant function analysis; Jackknife reclassification success; Null hypothesis; Otolith chemistry; Prior probabilities; Randomization test","classification; data set; discriminant analysis; marine ecosystem; maximum likelihood analysis; otolith; probability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846990136

In this work, we studied aboriginal populations from southern South America, the last continental region peopled by humans and with a wide range of ecological conditions. Because of these characteristics, southern South America provides a unique opportunity to study the relative importance of random and nonrandom factors in human diversification. Previous craniometric studies recognized remarkable differences among populations from this region, usually resorting to random factors as the main explanation. In contrast, here we suggest, using tests based on quantitative genetic models, that: (1) the rate of craniofacial divergence among these populations is too high and (2) the patterns of variation within and between populations are too different to be explained by genetic drift alone. In addition, the among-sample craniofacial variation is correlated with climate and diet but not with mtDNA variation. We suggest that the influence of nonrandom factors (e.g., plasticity, selection) on human craniofacial diversification in regions with large ecological variation is more important than generally acknowledged and capable to generate large craniofacial divergence in a short period of time. These results bring nonrandom factors into focus for the interpretation of human craniofacial variation. © 2009 The Author(s).","Ecological variation; Evolutionary rates; Geometric morphometrics; Patagonian populations","cranium; DNA; genetic analysis; human evolution; population type; quantitative analysis; adult; American Indian; article; cephalometry; female; fossil; genetic drift; genetic variability; histology; human; male; regression analysis; skull; South America; Adult; Cephalometry; Female; Fossils; Genetic Drift; Genetic Variation; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Regression Analysis; Skull; South America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-62749188811

The homoiology hypothesis predicts that osseous regions subject to repeated biomechanical stress during growth should be more variable and, therefore, less reliable for the reconstruction of phylogeny compared with osseous regions relatively unaffected by stress. Previous studies based on the analysis of multiple primate species found that regions of the cranium subject to masticatory-induced stress were significantly more variable than non-masticatory regions, as predicted by the homoiology hypothesis. However, these studies also found that the masticatory regions were no less reliable for reconstructing primate phylogenetic relationships when subjected to parsimony analysis. It was suggested, therefore, that homoiology may be a more potent problem for the reconstruction of phylogeny at the intraspecific level rather than interspecific phylogenetics. This suggestion was tested here using matched molecular and craniometric data for 12 modern human populations. The results show that, as predicted by the homoiology hypothesis, regions of the human cranium related to mastication were more variable than non-masticatory regions. However, masticatory regions were no less reliable for inferring human population history. Therefore, the results match those found from the interspecific analysis of primate species and do not support the suggestion that homoiology is a greater problem for the analysis of intraspecific taxa. The results also suggest that within-taxon variability cannot be relied upon to predict the phylogenetic efficacy of morphometric characters. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The distribution of the ages of (Formula presented.) haplotypes is informative about their demography, revealing recent bottlenecks, ancient splits, and more modern connections between populations.

It has been claimed that homoiologies are common in the hominin skull, especially in regions affected by masticatory strain, and that their prevalence is one reason why reconstructing hominin phylogenetic relationships is difficult. To evaluate this ""homoiology hypothesis,"" we performed analyses on a group of extant primates for which a robust molecular phylogeny is available-the hominoids. We compiled a data set from measurements that developmental considerations and experimental evidence suggest differ in their likelihood of exhibiting masticatory-strain-induced phenotypic plasticity. We then used the coefficient of variation and t-tests to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity of the measurements. We predicted that, if the hypothesis is correct, the measurements of skeletal features that do not remodel and therefore are unaffected by phenotypic plasticity should be less variable than the measurements of skeletal features that remodel and are subject to low-to-moderate strains, and that the latter should be less variable than the measurements of skeletal features that remodel and are subject to moderate-to-high strains. Subsequently, we performed phylogenetic analyses on character state data derived from the measurements and compared the resulting phylogenetic hypotheses to the consensus molecular phylogeny for the hominoids. We predicted that, if the hypothesis is correct, agreement between the phylogenies should be best for the non-phenotypically-plastic characters, intermediate for the low-to-moderate-strain characters, and worst for the moderate-to-high-strain characters. The results of the coefficient of variation/t-test analyses were consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis to the extent that the moderate-to-high-strain measurements exhibited significantly more variability than the non-phenotypically-plastic and low-to-moderate-strain measurements. In contrast, the results of the phylogenetic analyses were not those predicted. The phylogeny derived from the moderate-to-high-strain characters matched the molecular phylogeny better than those obtained using the non-phenotypically-plastic and low-to-moderate-strain characters. Thus, our study supports the suggestion that mechanical loading results in phenotypic plasticity in the hominin skull, but it does not support the notion that homoiologies have a significant negative impact on hominin phylogenetics. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the causes of morphological differentiation of Fueguian populations are still a controversial subject, the comparison with neutral variation could contribute to elucidate them. Samples of human remains from South America regions were used to analyze the evolutionary relationships. Several craniofacial traits observed in frontal and lateral view were analyzed by means of geometric morphometries techniques, and the evolutionary relationships based on morphological and molecular data were established in base to ordination analyses. The results from the facial skeleton agree with those obtained from mtDNA haplogroup frequencies, with La Pampa/Chaco samples detached from the Patagonian samples. Hence, the same mechanism that accounts for the pattern of frequency of haplogroups could explain the variation found in facial skeleton among the samples. It is suggested that such geographic pattern of craniofacial and molecular diversity may reflect the effect of genetic drift that occurred in the small founding populations isolated by distance or geographic barriers. Conversely, the results obtained using the traits from the lateral view slightly differ from the molecular results, showing differences between southernmost Patagonian and the other samples. Therefore, mechanisms other than genetic drift (e.g., natural selection) could have acted to shape the pattern observed in some craniofacial structures present in the lateral view, characterized by the fact that the southernmost Patagonian samples display the most robust and dolichocephalic crania. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Evolutionary relationships; Geometric morphometrics; mtDNA; South American aborigines","mitochondrial DNA; Aborigine; anatomical variation; article; craniofacial morphology; differentiation; gene frequency; genetic drift; genetic variability; geographic distribution; geometry; haplotype; human; molecular evolution; morphometrics; natural selection; population research; South America; Adolescent; Adult; Cephalometry; DNA, Mitochondrial; Female; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Humans; Indians, South American; Male; Middle Aged; Population Dynamics; Skull; South America",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547424481

Whether models obtained through photogrammetry can be used for zooarchaeological studies requires a systematic examination. In the context of research into dog domestication, we explore whether 3D models of wolf crania, obtained through a photogrammetric approach, accurately describe the original cranium in term of colouration, texture and most importantly, geometry.To answer this question, we compared the topology of 3D models obtained with a high-resolution surface scanner (used as reference geometry) with models reconstructed from the same five wolf crania using photogrammetry. The pairs of models were then compared using both a visual, qualitative and two quantitative approaches. The latter, a geometric comparison computed the deviation map between the pairs of 3D models, which was then followed by a 3D landmark based geometric morphometric approach using corresponding analyses.Our results demonstrate that photogrammetry can produce 3D models with visually satisfying levels of morphological detail in terms of texture, colouration and geometry. In addition, the quantitative comparison of the models revealed an average distance between the two surfaces of 0.088 mm with an average standard deviation of 0.53 mm. The geometric morphometric analyses revealed the same degree of measurement error for the two series of scans (2.04% and 1.95%), with only 6.31% of the morphometric variation being due to the acquisition technique. Photogrammetry, therefore, offers a low cost, easily portable and simple to perform alternative to traditional surface scanning, affording advantages that make it a highly useful tool for zooarchaeological research. © 2016 The Authors.","3D models; Canis lupus; Geometric morphometrics; Photogrammetry; Skull; Surface scanning; Wolf",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978225025

This is especially relevant and interesting for humans, where fine-scale population structure can both confound disease-mapping studies and reveal the history of migration and divergence that shaped our species’ diversity. Here we review notable recent advances in the detection, use, and understanding of population structure. Our work addresses multiple areas where substantial progress is being made: improved statistics and models for better capturing differentiation, admixture, and the spatial distribution of variation; computational speed-ups that allow methods to scale to modern data; and advances in haplotypic modeling that have wide ranging consequences for the analysis of population structure. We conclude by outlining four important open challenges: the limitations of discrete population models, uncertainty in individual origins, the incorporation of both fine-scale structure and ancient DNA in parametric models, and the development of efficient computational tools, particularly for haplotype-based methods. © 2016 The Author(s)",,"genetic variability; geographic mapping; geographic origin; haplotype; human; population differentiation; population genetic structure; population structure; priority journal; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism; genetic variation; genetics; genotype; history; migration; population genetics; mitochondrial DNA; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Genotype; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988474047

Three-dimensional temporal bone shape was captured using 15 landmarks on ontogenetic series of specimens from seven modern human populations. Discriminant function analysis revealed that population-specific temporal bone morphology is evident early in ontogeny, with significant shape differences among many human populations apparent prior to the eruption of the first molar. As early as five years of age, temporal bone shape reflects population history and can be used to reliably sort populations, although those in closer geographic proximity and molecular affinity are more likely to be misclassified. The deviation of cold-adapted populations from this general pattern of congruence between temporal bone morphology and genetic distances, identified in previous work, was confirmed here in adult and subadult specimens, and was revealed to occur earlier in ontogeny than previously recognized. Significant differences exist between the ontogenetic trajectories of some pairs of populations, but not among others, and the angles of these trajectories do not reflect genetic relationships or final adult temporal bone size. Significant intrapopulation differences are evident early in ontogeny, with differences becoming amplified by divergent trajectories in some groups. These findings elucidate how the congruence between adult human temporal bone morphology and population history develops, and reveal that this pattern corresponds closely to that described previously for facial ontogeny. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cranial variation; Ontogenetic trajectory; Subadult temporal bone morphology","bone; cranium; hominid; intraspecific variation; morphology; morphometry; ontogeny; Homo sapiens; adaptation; adult; article; classification; Cranial variation; histology; human; Ontogenetic trajectory; physical anthropology; population group; principal component analysis; species difference; Subadult temporal bone morphology; temporal bone; three dimensional imaging; Cranial variation; Ontogenetic trajectory; Subadult temporal bone morphology; Adaptation, Biological; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Population Groups; Principal Component Analysis; Species Specificity; Temporal Bone",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885374123

Yet there has been little focus on which data type works best. The goal of the present research is to test the discrimination ability of standard and nonstandard craniometric measurements and data derived from GM analysis. A total of 31 cranial landmarks were used to generate 465 interlandmark distances, including a subset of 20 commonly used measurements, and to generate principal component scores from procrustes coordinates. All were subjected to discriminant function analysis to ascertain which type of data performed best for ancestry estimation of American Black and White and Hispanic males and females. The nonstandard interlandmark distances generated the highest classification rates for females (90.5%) and males (88.2%). Using nonstandard interlandmark distances over more commonly used measurements leads to better ancestry estimates for our current population structure. © 2016 American Academy of Forensic Sciences","ancestry estimation; cranial measurements; forensic anthropology; forensic science; geometric morphometrics; interlandmark distances",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027918969

However, there is disagreement on whether certain parts of the cranium preserve this signature to a greater degree than other parts. It is also unclear how different quantitative measures of phenotype affect the association of genetic variation and anatomy. Here, we revisit these matters by testing the correlation of genetic distances and various phenotypic distances for ten modern human populations. Materials and Methods: Geometric morphometric shape data from the crania of adult individuals (n = 224) are used to calculate phenotypic PST, Procrustes, and Mahalanobis distances. We calculate their correlation to neutral genetic distances, FST, derived from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We subset the cranial data into landmark configurations that include the neurocranium, the face, and the temporal bone in order to evaluate whether these cranial regions are differentially correlated to neutral genetic variation. Results: Our results show that PST, Mahalanobis, and Procrustes distances are correlated with FST distances to varying degrees. They indicate that overall cranial shape is significantly correlated with neutral genetic variation. Of the component parts examined, PST distances for both the temporal bone and the face have a stronger association with FST distances than the neurocranium. When controlling for population divergence time, only the whole cranium and the temporal bone have a statistically significant association with FST distances. Discussion: Our results confirm that the cranium, as a whole, and the temporal bone can be used to reconstruct modern human population history. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","geometric morphometrics; population genetics; quantitative genetics; SNPs","adult; anatomy; gene mutation; genetic distance; genetic variation; human; major clinical study; morphometrics; quantitative genetics; single nucleotide polymorphism; temporal bone; validation process; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; female; genetics; genomics; male; physical anthropology; population genetics; procedures; reproducibility; single nucleotide polymorphism; skull; standards; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Female; Genetics, Population; Genomics; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reproducibility of Results; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994509663

Rooted in cloning and limited sequencing of DNA from ancient remains during the pre-PCR era, the field has made incredible progress since the introduction of PCR and next-generation sequencing. Over the last decade, aDNA analysis ushered in a new era in genomics and became the method of choice for reconstructing the history of organisms, their biogeography, and migration routes, with applications in evolutionary biology, population genetics, archaeogenetics, paleoepidemiology, and many other areas. This change was brought by development of new strategies for coping with the challenges in studying aDNA due to damage and fragmentation, scarce samples, significant historical gaps, and limited applicability of population genetics methods. In this review, we describe the state-of-the-art achievements in aDNA studies, with particular focus on human evolution and demographic history. We present the current experimental and theoretical procedures for handling and analysing highly degraded aDNA. We also review the challenges in the rapidly growing field of ancient epigenomics.

However, attempts to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships from craniodental data in extant primates have yielded inconsistent and inconclusive results. Objective: To critically evaluate a recent body of research, conducted within an explicitly quantitative genetics framework, which investigates the extent to which human cranial variation reflects past population history. Possible ways in which to extrapolate these human-specific insights to higher taxonomic levels will also be assessed. Results: A consensus is emerging confirming a largely neutral model for the human cranium, although specific instances of climatic and dietary adaptation have also been uncovered. Also, specific regions of the cranium, delineated according to particular criteria, differ in their relative genetic congruence. However, the genetic congruence patterns identified in modern humans are not replicated in other extant primates, calling their generality into question. Conclusions: Developing a clearer understanding of the evolution of morphological diversity in extinct taxa requires a different inference approach that focuses on assessing the evolutionary forces that shape these patterns, rather than the identification of particular morphological regions that correlate with genetic relatedness across all primates. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.","Extant primate models; Fossil hominins; Macroevolution; Microevolution; Phylogenetics","cranium; fossil record; hominid; human evolution; phylogenetics; primate; relatedness; anatomy and histology; animal; evolution; genetic variability; genetics; hominid; human; mandible; phylogeny; physical anthropology; primate; skull; tooth; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Biological Evolution; Genetic Variation; Hominidae; Humans; Mandible; Phylogeny; Primates; Skull; Tooth",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902655747
