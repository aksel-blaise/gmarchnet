We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society","climate surfaces; cloud cover; interpolation; land surface temperature; MODIS; solar radiation; vapour pressure; wind speed; WorldClim","Atmospheric temperature; Image resolution; Interpolation; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Solar radiation; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Weather information services; Cloud cover; Land surface temperature; MODIS; Vapour pressures; Wind speed; WorldClim; Wind; cloud cover; data set; interpolation; land surface; MODIS; solar radiation; spatial resolution; surface temperature; vapor pressure; wind velocity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019264593

Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

Isometry, or independence of shape and size, is defined as the independence of some (all) shape vector(s) from a particular size variable. With mild restrictions it is shown that isometry is possible with respect to at most one size variable, or in other words that shape will always be related to a variety of size variables. The choice of a size variable is a hitherto neglected, but important, part of an allometric study. The use of functional relationships in allometry is contrasted with the approach developed here. Also, size and shape variables are used in characterizations of the lognormal, gamma and generalized gamma distributions.

However, the validity of the rule has been debated. We examined the relationship between size and latitude as well as size and temperature within various species of mammals. We also tested the idea that smaller mammals follow Bergmann's rule more strongly than larger mammals, as expected if heat conservation is the cause of the rule. When all studies were included, the percentage of species showing a positive correlation between size and latitude was significantly >50% (78 of 110 species). Similarly, the percentage of species showing a negative correlation between size and temperature was significantly >50% (48 of 64). Analyses using only significant studies or only studies that sampled extensively also support Bergmann's rule. The size-latitude and size-temperature trends were consistent within all orders and most families for which data are available. We did not find support for the hypothesis that smaller mammals conform more strongly to Bergmann's rule than larger mammals. Thus, we found broad support for Bergmann's rule as a general trend for mammals; however, our analyses do not support heat conservation as the explanation.","Bergmann's rule; Body size; Geographic variation; Mammals","body size; latitude; mammal; temperature",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033804463

When too few landmarks are available, outlines can be digitized as series of discrete points. The individual points must be slid along a tangential direction so as to remove tangential variation, because contours should be homologous from subject to subject whereas their individual points need not. This variation can be removed by minimizing either bending energy (BE) or Procrustes distance (D) with respect to a mean reference form. Because these two criteria make different assumptions, it becomes necessary to study how these differences modify the results obtained. We performed bootstrapped-based Goodall's F-test, Foote's measurement, principal component (PC) and discriminant function analyses on human molars and craniometric data to compare the results obtained by the two criteria. Results show that: (1) F-scores and P-values were similar for both criteria; (2) results of Foote's measurement show that both criteria yield different estimates of within- and between-sample variation; (3) there is low correlation between the first PC axes obtained by D and BE; (4) the percentage of correct classification is similar for BE and D, but the ordination of groups along discriminant scores differs between them. The differences between criteria can alter the results when morphological variation in the sample is small, as in the analysis of modern human populations. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation. © 2006 Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland.","Dental and facial data; Minimum bending energy; Minimum Procrustes distance","accuracy; anthropometric parameters; article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; correlation analysis; craniofacial morphology; functional assessment; geometry; human; intermethod comparison; molar tooth; priority journal; reference value; scoring system; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Dentition; Facial Bones; Humans; Male; Models, Anatomic; Molar",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744472832

Data for terrestrial mammals and birds indicate that even on a logarithmic scale frequency distributions of body mass among species are significantly skewed towards larger sizes. The authors used simulation models to evaluate the extent to which macro- and microevolutionary processes are sufficient to explain these distributions. Simulations of a purely cladogenetic process with no bias in extinction of speciation rates for different body sizes did not produce skewed log body mass distributions. Simulations that included size-biased extinction rates, especially those that incorporated anagenetic size change within species between speciation and extinction events, regularly produced skewed distributions. Although cladogenetic processes, probably play a significant role in body size evolution, there must also be a significant anagenetic component. The regular variation in the form of mammalian body size distributions among different-sized islands and continents suggests that environmental conditions operating through both macro- and microevolutionary processes, determine to a large extent the diversification of body sizes within faunas. Macroevolution is not decoupled from microevolution. -Authors",,"body size; macroevolution; microevolution; Aves; Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027038474

Experimentally this study took into account restriction site polymorphism, overall length variation of the noncoding region, and numbers of repeated sequences. Nucleotide divergences indicate that the mtDNAs from the three species derived from a common ancestor some 6-8 million years (Myr) ago. Every animal appeared heteroplasmic for a set of molecules with various lengths of the noncoding region and variable numbers of repeated sequences that contribute to them. This systematic heteroplasmy, most probably generated by a rate of localized mtDNA rearrangements high enough to counterbalance the cellular segregation of rearranged molecules, is a shared derived character of leporids. The geographic distribution of mtDNA polymorphism among wild rabbit populations over the western European basin shows that two molecular lineages are represented, one in southern Spain, the second over northern Spain, France, and Tunisia. These two lineages derived from a common ancestor some 2 Myr ago. Their present geographical distribution may be correlated to the separation of rabbits into two stocks at the time of Mindel glaciation. Finally the distribution of mtDNA diversity exhibits a mosaic pattern both at inter- and intrapopulation levels. © 1991 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.","Evolution; Heteroplasmy; Lagomorphs; Mitochondrial DNA; Rabbit; Restriction site polymorphism","mitochondrial dna; animal tissue; article; dna polymorphism; evolution; hare; kidney; liver; nonhuman; priority journal; rabbit; Animalia; Lagomorpha; Leporidae; Lepus; Lepus capensis; Lepus europaeus; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Sylvilagus floridanus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025999872

These postulates situate hominids as the knower of their natural surroundings and make them capable of selecting within the range of resources available in their landscapes. Using a zooarchaeological approach, the taxonomical representation in an anthropogenic site could indicate both the environment diversity that human groups can exploit and the decisions that they make when selecting prey. The Optimal Foraging theory is a basic decision model that is ideally applied within a larger framework of constraining conditions such as differential prey distributions, food-consumer imbalances and/or competition, among others. Nevertheless, if this theory is applied to human behaviour, uncontrolled variables could exist and substantially alter some predictions. These variables may not always be related to the need to optimise the resources; additionally, they can respond to the questions related to nutritional ecology, cultural standards or social relationships conditioned by ecological or technological factors. Environmental and socio-cultural aspects invite us to reflect on the characteristics that delimit the pre-Upper Palaeolithic diet and its correct assessment in relation to the availability of prey in the environment and the human behavioural parameters. In this study, we present data from several levels of Bolomor Cave (Valencia, Spain, MIS 9-5e) and a sample from the TD10-1 sublevel of Gran Dolina (Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos, Spain, MIS 9). Both sites have been interpreted as habitat places and allow us to infer the high plasticity of human groups with respect to methods and techniques of acquisition and use of a diverse spectrum of prey. Environmental availability, duration and type of settlement seem to significantly influence the taxonomical representation and must be taken into account when assessing diet breadth in these chronologies. We must add to these factors, human behavioural variables related to social and cultural aspects. Using this approach, we highlight the high variability in the subsistence strategies developed by hominids in the European Middle Pleistocene and propose several factors to consider when examining the early use of small prey. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Behavioural diversity; Bolomor Cave; Broad spectrum diet; Environmental availability; Gran Dolina TD10-1; Iberian Peninsula; Middle Pleistocene","Behavioural diversity; Broad spectrum; Gran Dolina TD10-1; Iberian Peninsula; Middle Pleistocene; Caves; Ecology; Nutrition; Behavioral research; behavioral ecology; diet; meat; Neanderthal; nutritional requirement; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; subsistence; Bolomor Cave; Burgos [Castilla y Leon]; Castilla y Leon; Comunidad Valencia; Gran Dolina; Iberian Peninsula; Sierra de Atapuerca; Spain; Valencia [Comunidad Valencia]; Hominidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877149235

Apart from historical fragmentation that resulted in geographic discontinuity of two distinct mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) clades A and B, patterns of haplotype genetic variability have been shaped mostly by restricted gene flow via isolation by distance. The distribution of tip versus interior haplotypes suggests that dispersal occurred from both the southwestern and northeastern groups. Dispersal from the southwest had a north and northwest direction, whereas from the northeast it had mostly a western and southern orientation, with subsequent overlap in a southeastern-northwestern axis across the Iberian Peninsula. The analysis of the pairwise mismatch distribution of a 179-181-bp fragment of the mtDNA control region, for seven of those populations, further supports the idea that major patterns of dispersal were in the direction of central Iberia. Additionally, rabbit populations do not show signs of any significant loss of genetic diversity in the recent past, implying that they maintained large population sizes and structure throughout the ice ages. This is congruent with the fact that the Iberian Peninsula was itself a glacial refugium during Quaternary ice ages. Nonetheless, climatic oscillations of this period, although certainly milder than in northern Europe, were sufficient to affect the range distributions of Iberian organisms.","European rabbit; Iberian Peninsula; Mismatch distribution; Mitochondrial DNA; Nested clade analysis; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Postglacial dispersal","biogeography; dispersal; lagomorph; mitochondrial DNA; Postglacial; refugium; Europe; Iberian Peninsula; Lagomorpha; Mammalia; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Oryctolagus cuniculus; cytochrome b; mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; base mispairing; genetic variability; genetics; haplotype; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; Portugal; rabbit; sequence alignment; Spain; Animals; Base Pair Mismatch; Base Sequence; Cytochrome b Group; DNA, Mitochondrial; Haplotypes; Molecular Sequence Data; Portugal; Rabbits; Sequence Alignment; Spain; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035999489

However, mass collecting events may invalidate this assumption. This paper explores historical evidence for mass collecting of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), assesses the potential impact of this technique on assumptions about rabbit returns, and sets forth methods for identifying mass collecting in zooarchaeological assemblages. These methods are then applied to two sites from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition in southwestern France. While rabbits were hunted individually at one site (Moulin du Roc), the prehistoric inhabitants of the other site (Pont d'Ambon) took at least some rabbits in mass. This suggests that current hypotheses about changing diet breadth at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition in the Dordogne need to be re-evaluated. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

No sexual dimorphism in cleaned body weight was observed. The 1150–1199‐gm. weight group was that of greatest frequency in both sexes, and very few animals were obtained exceeding 1500 gm. in weight. Body weight does not provide a good criterion for distinguishing adults from young in either sex. The average weight of young at birth probably is between 40 and 45 gms. The testes of adults reach a maximum size in April. They then decline in weight by over 60 per cent., reaching a minimum in July. The testes begin to increase in weight again in August. The drop in weight is accompanied by a decline in spermatogenesis, and it begins during the height of the breeding season, one month before the decline in the pregnancy rate. Copulation occurs at least twice as frequently with non‐pregnant females which are not in œstrus as with those that are. Copulation also occurs frequently with pregnant females at all stages, but especially during the first four days of gestation. These copulations with females that are not in heat are most frequent during November, December and January, that is, during the quarter preceding the breeding season. The breeding season in Caernarvonshire is sharply defined; it begins in January and ends in June. More than 50 per cent, of females were pregnant for 17 weeks in 1941 and for 15 weeks in 1942. The 1942 breeding season was slightly earlier than that in 1941. Practically all females become pregnant again at each post‐partumœstrus during the height of the breeding season. An exception is provided by the period of severe frost in February and March 1942, during which many animals failed to become pregnant at the post‐partumœstrus. During March April and May over 80 per cent, of animals suckling are pregnant. Young females born early in the breeding season may breed before the end of it, or in the late summer or autumn. True pseudopregnancy is very rare in the wild animals. It was concluded that the time of the onset of the breeding season is determined by the females, but that its close is determined by the males. The wild rabbit differs from the tame rabbit chiefly in (a) the sharp delimitation of the breeding season, (b) the intensity of breeding during the season, (c) the maintenance of pregnancy during lactation normally, and (d) the extreme rarity of true pseudopregnancy. The pre‐natal mortality during 1941 has been dealt with in a preliminary paper (Brambell, 1942). The conclusions arrived at are confirmed and extended. The proportion of litters showing loss was slightly higher in 1942 than in 1941, but this discrepancy is accounted for by (a) the difference in litter size in the two samples, and (b) experimental error. It is estimated that 60 per cent, of litters conceived are lost owing to the death and reabsorption of all the embryos. The proportion of litters showing loss is related directly to the initial size of litter. It is not related to (a) the cleaned body weight of the mother, (b) whether the litter is the first of the season or a subsequent one, (c) whether the mother is or is not suckling. It is shown that animals which have borne a living litter are as likely to lose the next, and no more likely, than those that have lost a litter already. The majority of the embryos die on or about the twelfth day. The possible causes of this extraordinary mortality are discussed. The loss of ova in litters that survive to birth is between 9 and 10 per cent. The number of ova ovulated at œstrus, as shown by the number of corpora lutea in the ovaries, varied from one to nine, five being the most frequent. The mean number was 5·36 for the whole sample. There was a significant difference in the mean numbers for 1941 and 1942 respectively, the former being 4·89 and the latter 5·64. The mean number of ova ovulated is related directly to body weight. It is shown that for a given body weight the mean number of ova ovulated was greater in 1942 than in 1941, but the increase in the mean number of ova ovulated for a given increase in body weight was similar in the two seasons. It is calculated that the most productive initial litter sizes are five and six, the inflection in the curve of number of embryos expected to survive according to initial litter size being at 5·7. A few instances in which the number of embryos exceeded the number of corpora lutea are recorded. These must have been due either to poly‐ovular follicles or poly‐embryony. Six instances of transperitoneal migration of ova are recorded, five being from right to left and one from left to right. It is estimated that the mean number of young born to each adult female is between 10·35 and 11·70 per annum. The post‐natal sex‐ratio of the whole sample was 50·49 ±0·76 per cent. males. The fœtal sex‐ratio was 48·65 ± 1·045 per cent, males, which does not differ significantly from the post‐natal ratio.

DNA was extracted from 90 rabbit bones found in 22 archaeological sites dated between the Mesolithic and recent times. Nucleotide sequences present in a variable 233-bp domain of the cytochrome b gene were compared to those present in modern-day rabbits. The results show that the structure of ancient populations of wild rabbit exhibited remarkable stability over time until the Middle Ages. At this time, a novel type of mtDNA molecule abruptly appears into most wild populations studied from France. This mtDNA type corresponds to that currently present in the domestic breeds of rabbit examined so far. The relative rapidity by which this mtDNA type established and its absence in all sites examined before 1,700 years ago lend support to the hypothesis that between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, man may have favored the development, into all regions of France, of animals carrying this particular mtDNA molecule. The origin of such animals has still to be found: animals previously living outside of France or within France but in very restricted areas?

We tested this hypothesis by studying a small teleost (nine-spined stickleback, Pungitius pungitius) from four marine and five lake (diverse fish community) and nine pond (impoverished fish community) populations. In line with theory, pond fish tended to be larger than their marine or lake conspecifics, sometimes reaching giant sizes. In two geographically independent cases when predatory fish had been introduced into ponds, fish were smaller than those in nearby ponds lacking predators. Pond fish were also smaller when found in sympatry with three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) than those in ponds lacking competitors. Size-at-age analyses demonstrated that larger size in ponds was achieved by both increased growth rates and extended longevity of pond fish. Results from a common garden experiment indicate that the growth differences had a genetic basis: pond fish developed two to three times higher body mass than marine fish during 36 weeks of growth under similar conditions. Hence, reduced risk of predation and interspecific competition appear to be chief forces driving insular body size evolution toward gigantism. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","Body size; Competition; Island rule; Natural selection; Predation; Pungitius","fresh water; sea water; body mass; body size; conspecific; evolutionary biology; freshwater environment; growth rate; hypothesis testing; interspecific competition; longevity; marine environment; natural selection; predation risk; sympatry; teleost; animal; article; evolution; genetic selection; genetics; gigantism; growth, development and aging; physiology; predation; Smegmamorpha; Animals; Evolution; Fresh Water; Gigantism; Predatory Behavior; Seawater; Selection, Genetic; Smegmamorpha; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Pungitius; Pungitius pungitius; Teleostei",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450213134

In contrast, taphonomic studies have shown that fast small-sized prey taxa, such as leporids, small carnivores and birds, were rarely exploited during these time periods. These faunal patterns are often interpreted as indicating that Neandertals were characterized by a narrow diet, a finding with important social and technological implications. This paper reexamines this view using faunal data from Les Canalettes layer 4, a Middle Paleolithic faunal assemblage in Mediterranean France dominated by rabbit remains. Multiple lines of evidence, including the presence of cutmarks and shaft cylinders, suggest that humans accumulated most of the rabbit specimens found in this layer. This and other comparable assemblages raise a number of issues with respect to variations in diet breadth prior to the Upper Paleolithic. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"bioindicator; diet; exploitation; Neanderthal; Paleolithic; skeletal remains; small mammal; taphonomy; taxonomy; ungulate; Asia; France; Aves; Leporidae; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Ungulata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861573349

Some 89% of males and 96% of females lived in groups containing at least one other rabbit of the same sex.

Juveniles were trapped and tagged for individual identification soon after their emergence from underground nests. Age was estimated from weight on first capture and survivorship determined from the last date individuals were observed. Differences in growth rates of young born throughout the season and between the three years of the study were related to population density. Maternal social status had no significant effect on post‐emergence growth rates of kittens, or on offspring survival. Young born in females' first litters of the season, in March, had significantly lower mortality than subsequent litters. Cats and stoats were regularly observed on the study site and are likely to have been major agents of juvenile mortality. There was no difference in the growth rates of the sexes, and correspondingly non‐breeding adult males and females were of similar body weight. From their first days above ground juvenile males suffered significantly higher mortality than females. Differential mortality may be linked to previously reported sex differences in behaviour if the greater activity of young males made them more vulnerable to predation or attack by neighbouring territorial conspecifics.

Collection sites encompassed a wide range of ecogeographical and climatic regimes. We compared data from Israeli hares with occlusal characters of 160 cape hares L. capensis from East Africa and 68 brown hares L. europaeus from central Europe. Only three teeth (I1, I2, M3) did not show occlusal variation. Thirty-eight occlusal characters were derived from dental variants by dichotomous (0/1) scoring. Absence of association of character states among characters of single teeth indicated a lack of morphotypes. Epigenetic differentiation among hares from northern, central and southern Israel, and the two East African, and two central European samples, was revealed by pairwise C. A. B. Smith's 'mean measures of divergence' (MMD), based on frequencies of character states. Cluster analyses of MMD values revealed little epigenetic differentiation between northern and southern Israeli hares, but greater differentiation between central European and East African hares. Concordance of the MMD matrix with linear geographical distances among sampling regions was demonstrated by a Mantel test. No frequencies of character states exhibited significant changes across the climatic parameters among hares from northern and southern Israel. But the individual folding index, which expresses the degree of enamel on the occlusal surface, slightly decreased from north to south. Our results support a phylogenetic interpretation of occlusal character variation. Despite distinct differences in external appearance, hares from northern and southern Israel probably comprise a single species that encompasses two closely related geographical populations with a probable area of overlap.

Recent ancient DNA (aDNA) research also indicates the incorporation of European wild boar into domestic stock during the Neolithization process. In order to establish the timing of the arrival of domestic pigs into Europe, and to test hypotheses regarding the role European wild boar played in the domestication process, we combined a geometric morphometric analysis (allowing us to combine tooth size and shape) of 449 Romanian ancient teeth with aDNA analysis. Our results firstly substantiate claims that the first domestic pigs in Romania possessed the same mtDNA signatures found in Neolithic pigs in west and central Anatolia. Second, we identified a significant proportion of individuals with large molars whose tooth shape matched that of archaeological (likely) domestic pigs. These large ‘domestic shape’ specimens were present from the outset of the Romanian Neolithic (6100–5500 cal BC) through to later prehistory, suggesting a long history of admixture between introduced domestic pigs and local wild boar. Finally, we confirmed a turnover in mitochondrial lineages found in domestic pigs, possibly coincident with human migration into Anatolia and the Levant that occurred in later prehistory. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Level III of Teixoneres Cave (MIS 3) is a sample that can be used to address the origin of leporid assemblages in archaeological contexts. Applying an archaeozoological and taphonomi-cal methodology has made it possible to state that the assemblage of leporids in the sitehas been generated by a mix of contributions, in which small mammal carnivores and noc-turnal raptors seem to play an important role, together with occasional hominid inputs.

The origin of the travellers determined the phylogenetic source of the insular mice, which encountered diverse ecological and environmental conditions on the various islands. Insular mice are thus an exceptional model to disentangle the relative role of phylogeny, ecology and climate in evolution. Molar shape is known to vary according to phylogeny and to respond to adaptation. Using for the first time a three-dimensional geometric morphometric approach, compared with a classical two-dimensional quantification, the relative effects of size variation, phylogeny, climate and ecology were investigated on molar shape diversity across a variety of islands. Phylogeny emerged as the factor of prime importance in shaping the molar. Changes in competition level, mostly driven by the presence or absence of the wood mouse on the different islands, appeared as the second most important effect. Climate and size differences accounted for slight shape variation.

A second sample of 2672 individuals was taken from a long-term live capture study at one site, and a third sample derives from the subsequent removal sampling of 233 rabbits, using five main methods, on that site. The last sample consisted of 346 rabbits from two managed estates using three methods. The age and sex ratios were also compared with published data. In general, aboveground methods of “capture” were biased toward males and within-warren methods toward females. Some methods, particularly shotguns or ferreting, resulted in samples which did not appear to be representative of the age structure of the population, when compared with other methods of sampling.

Old excavations and a lack of taphonomic context are often factors that limit our ability to address these questions. To better appreciate the exact nature of what is potentially the oldest burial in Western Europe, Regourdou (Montignac-sur-Vézère, Dordogne), and to better understand the taphonomy of this site excavated more than 50 years ago, we report in this contribution a study of the most abundant animals throughout its stratigraphy: the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In addition to questions surrounding the potential bioturbation of the site's stratigraphy, analysis of the Regourdou rabbits could provide new information on Neandertal subsistence behavior. The mortality profile, skeletal-part representation, breakage patterns, surface modification, and comparison with modern reference collections supports the hypothesis that the Regourdou rabbit remains were primarily accumulated due to natural (attritional) mortality. Radiocarbon dates performed directly on the rabbit remains give ages ranging within the second half of Marine Isotope Stage 3, notably younger than the regional Mousterian period. We posit that rabbits dug their burrows within Regourdou's sedimentological filling, likely inhabiting the site after it was filled. The impact of rabbit activity now brings into question both the reliability of the archaeostratigraphy of the site and the paleoenvironmental reconstructions previously proposed for it, and suggests rabbits may have played a role in the distribution of the Neandertal skeletal remains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Attritional accumulation; Bioturbation; Burrow; Middle Palaeolithic; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Taphonomy","accumulation; bioturbation; burrow; cultural history; Neanderthal; paleoenvironment; Paleolithic; radiocarbon dating; small mammal; taphonomy; Aquitaine; Dordogne; France; Oryctolagus cuniculus; animal; burial; Europe; fossil; Homo neanderthalensis; Leporidae; radiometric dating; reproducibility; time factor; Animals; Burial; Europe; Fossils; Neanderthals; Rabbits; Radiometric Dating; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030454166

Using images from 345 specimens, encompassing 15 extant taxa of equids, we quantified the occlusal enamel folding pattern in four mandibular cheek teeth with a single geometric morphometric protocol. We initially investigated the protocol accuracy by assigning each tooth to its correct anatomical position and taxonomic group. We then contrasted the phylogenetic signal present in each tooth shape with an exome-wide phylogeny from 10 extant equine species. We estimated the strength of the phylogenetic signal using a Brownian motion model of evolution with multivariate K statistic, and mapped the dental shape along the molecular phylogeny using an approach based on squared-change parsimony. We found clear evidence for the relevance of dental phenotypes to accurately discriminate all modern members of the genus Equus and capture their phylogenetic relationships. These results are valuable for both palaeontologists and zooarchaeologists exploring the spatial and temporal dynamics of the evolutionary history of the horse family, up to the latest domestication trajectories of horses and donkeys. © 2017 The Authors.","Equid evolutionary history; Equus; Fossil record; Phylogenetic signal; Shape; Tooth geometric morphometrics",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017259056

Rabbit bones are regularly recovered from archaeological and palaeontological sites; however, demonstrating their contemporaneity with associated material is often difficult. Additionally, determining the origin of rabbit remains in fossil sites is equally problematic due to the lack of reference collections for natural accumulations. In order to address these issues, we excavated a modern rabbit warren in southwestern France using modern archaeological field methods and techniques. The bone accumulation was analysed using a taphonomic approach in order to determine the most relevant criteria for identifying fossil warrens. The assemblage is heavily fragmented and dominated by individuals less than three months old and, unlike what could be expected, no preserved anatomical connections were documented. Bone concentration is low and connected to occupation duration. Taken together, the criteria we identify aide in better identifying fossil warrens in fossil sites as well as evaluate the integrity of the deposits. Finally, our results also add precision to environmental, biostratigraphic and palaeoethnographic interpretations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Attritional accumulation; Bioturbation; Burrow; Natural mortality; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Skeletal representation; Taphonomy",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994052300

Distinguishing rabbits (Oryctolagus) from hares (Lepus) in the archeological and palaeontological record of Pleistocene Europe is complicated due to the variability of their size and morphology. Here, we present the first description of two Pleistocene leporid species from Bois-de-Riquet (Lézignan-la-Cèbe, Hérault) in southern France. The first, Oryctolagus cf. giberti, exhibits similar characteristics to rabbit species documented in Spain and, thus, for the first time is recorded outside the Iberian Peninsula. The second leporid is a hare represented by very limited number of non-diagnostic remains, which, unfortunately, precludes an exact species identification. Already known from Lower Pleistocene deposits in Central Europe and Spain, the presence of Lepus sp. in southern France sheds new light on the geographic extension of these species. In this respect, Bois-de-Riquet is an important paleontological site that can further our understanding of the evolutionary history and expansion of European leporids. © 2015 Académie des sciences.","2D geometric morphometry; Biochronology; Evolution; Lepus sp.; Oryctolagus cf. giberti; Systematic","biochronology; climate oscillation; evolutionary theory; lagomorph; morphometry; new record; paleontology; Pleistocene; taxonomy; France; Iberian Peninsula; Spain; Lagomorpha; Leporidae; Lepus; Lepus sp.; Mammalia; Oryctolagus; Oryctolagus cuniculus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941995108

Sexes were pooled after univariate and multivariate testing for sexual dimorphism and eliminating bizygomatic breadth. By means of univariate statistics, Mahalanobis generalized distance and canonical analysis, the various Australian and British Isles samples were shown to differ appreciably, morphometric distance increasing clinally in eastern Australia with geographic distance from the point of introduction (Geelong, Vic.). Based on a plot of first and second canonical variates, differences between three Canberra area samples were comparable in magnitude to those between certain populations separated by much greater geographic distances.

Trapping was followed by pump gassing and ferreting in its turn by spoon gassing, with a cyanogenetic powder. Gin trapping yielded a higher return of rabbits per man hour (1.5) than ferreting (1.0), particularly during the initial stages of clearance. Ferreting gave a steady return. Pump gassing of burrows, when surface‐living rabbits were present, proved ineffective, owing to re‐opening of holes from the outside. Spoon gassing of burrows, integrated with the removal of surface‐living rabbits by ‘dog and gun’, was successful but expensive in time (0.5 rabbits per man hour), compared with gin trapping and ferreting. The valuable place of ‘dog and gun’ in planned rabbit clearance was clearly demonstrated. Trapping yielded equal numbers of bucks and does. Ferreting yielded a higher proportion of does. Spoon gassing (after ferreting) yielded more bucks than does when the holes were dug out. Surface‐living rabbits were predominantly bucks. Copyright © 1951, Wiley Blackwell.

Highly divergent genetic lineages arose, some of which correspond to recognized subspecies that currently occupy small geographical areas. Understanding the implications of the genetic differences between these subspecies is crucial for proper conservation of Evolutionarily Significant Units. We use the two European rabbit subspecies, Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus and O. c. algirus, in the Iberian Peninsula as a model to investigate the repercussions at the biometric level of their largely recognized genetic differentiation. To accomplish this we analysed the ear and hind foot length, and the body mass of 999 adult rabbits from 27 locations across the distribution range of both subspecies in their native range, the Iberian Peninsula. Our results show biometric differences between the two subspecies, also explained by geographical location and sex, O. c. algirus being lighter and having shorter ear and hind foot lengths. We examine these findings under an evolutionary framework, and discuss their implications for current conservation efforts. Future research should focus on the ecological implications of these biometric differences, namely potential different habitat use and anti-predatory strategies in the species' native range. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.","Body mass; Ear length; Evolutionarily Significant Units; Hind foot length; Lagomorphs; Morphology; Native range; Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus; Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus","antipredator defense; biometry; body mass; conservation genetics; ecological modeling; genetic analysis; genetic differentiation; geographical region; habitat use; home range; lagomorph; morphology; native species; population distribution; Iberian Peninsula; Lagomorpha; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus; Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938739951

On two farms rabbits were caught alive in snares, marked and released just before trapping; the total number of rabbits marked, divided by the fraction of marked rabbits recovered in the trapped sample gave an estimate of the population before trapping started. Trapping usually removed 30–40 % of the rabbits present, a proportion compatible with a careful cropping of the population. At one farm, studied for 3 years, the population increased steadily. Breeding was intense from January to June inclusive, and from weight and age distributions it was apparent that in 1948 and 1949 considerable breeding also occurred in autumn. The sex ratio varied around a mean of about 50%. Data are given on movements, obtained from recapture records of zog marked animals. They suggest that rabbits probably forage over an area of not more than 150 yards in diameter. The records from recaptured marked animals indicate that the mean expectation of life is about 6 months.

However, small prey exploitation was not uniform: the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is the most frequent species in the Upper Palaeolithic archaeological record of the Iberian Peninsula – south and Mediterranean area – and Southern France. This is demonstrated at Molí del Salt, an Upper Palaeolithic site located at Vimbodí (Catalonia, Spain), whose mammal fauna stands out for the predominance of rabbits [91% of minimum number of individuals (n = 136)]. We analysed the faunal remains from one level [Asup (c. 12 700–13 000 cal BP)] in order to identify the agent responsible for the faunal accumulation, and to reconstruct aspects of procurement and consumption that shed light on Palaeolithic subsistence strategies in the Northeast Iberian Peninsula. Our results indicate that human agency rather than carnivore activity was responsible for the bone accumulation at Molí del Salt. We identified all the stages in the consumption sequence from skinning to ingestion. We argue that the rabbits were mostly harvested during summer or winter or both seasons. Clearly, the European rabbit was a target species for the human groups which lived at Molí del Salt providing meat, and skin. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

Murialdo, 1, Roma, 00146, Italy","The extreme rareness of Sardinian fossil sites older than Middle and Late Pleistocene makes the Monte Tuttavista karst complex (E Sardinia, Italy) very important. Remarkable lagomorph material, recovered from several fissure infillings of Monte Tuttavista referable to the Capo Figari/Orosei 1 and Orosei 2 faunal sub-complexes (early Pleistocene, ∼2.1/1.9-1.1 Ma), allowed us to describe a new endemic insular leporid, Sardolagus obscurus n. gen. n. sp. The new taxon is characterized by a peculiar combination of an advanced p3 (Lepus-type) and a primitive P2 lacking deep flexa. The origin of such discrepancy, unprecedented among continental and insular endemic European leporids, is unclear. It could be the result of: (1) an independent evolution of p3 from an ancestor bearing the primitive P2/p3 (e.g., Alilepus, Hypolagus), or (2) a selective reversal morphocline from an Oryctolagus/Lepus-like leporine. The lack of data about the phylogenetic origin of the new taxon makes any inference about its possible arrival to Sardinia problematic. Crossing the European leporid records and evidence of migrations to Sardinia, we hypothesize three possible ages in which the ancestor of Sardolagus obscurus could have arrived in Sardinia, restricted to the late Miocene-early/late Pliocene (∼8-3.6 Ma). The phylogenetic relationship between Sardolagus obscurus n. gen. n. sp. and the oldest Sardinian leporid, recorded from Capo Mannu D1 and dated at the early/late Pliocene boundary (∼3.6 Ma), is unclear at present, however it is quite likely that they pertain to the same lineage. © Copyright 2018, The Paleontological Society.",,"ancestry; endemic species; fossil; karst; lagomorph; Miocene; new genus; new species; new taxon; paleobiogeography; phylogenetics; Pleistocene; Pliocene; taxonomy; Italy; Monte Tuttavista; Nuoro; Sardinia; Lagomorpha; Leporidae; Lepus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045958434

However, its spread across the island seems to have decreased and fragmented in recent times, but until now no accurate population management has been carried out due to the lack of ethological, ecological and taxonomic knowledge. A biometric analysis of European rabbit specimens from Sicily to widen current taxonomic knowledge was performed. In this paper, 7 body variables and 23 cranial variables of 166 and 120 individuals, respectively, were examined. Thereafter, the results were compared with biometric data from other European populations. The comparison showed that the body size and skull measurement in Sicilian specimens of European rabbit seem to be quite distinct from those given in the literature on rabbit in south-west Spain, whose populations were assigned to Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus subspecies, whereas it was particularly close to the average size of populations in northern Spain and southern France, assigned to Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus. Moreover, the Sicilian taxon was not correlated with Bergmann's rule, showing characteristics that could be the result of its introduction, population management or insularity. Biomolecular analyses will be necessary to definitely clarify the taxonomy of European rabbit in Sicily. © WRSA, UPV, 2003.","Biometry; European rabbit; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Sicily; Taxonomy",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907664160

The commensal Western European house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) lives in close contact with humans, and as such it lies between wild and domesticated animals. However, it also occurs in non-anthropogenic environments, forming feral populations, and hence provides the opportunity to document how feralization may impact morphology. In this study, three 'feral' populations from Orkney, the Kerguelen Archipelago and southern France were compared to Western European commensal populations. The shape and biomechanical properties of the jaw were analysed to assess the impacts of 'feralization' on an organ that is under major environmental pressures through its feeding function. Mandible shape varied mostly with climate and phylogeny, and feral populations differed only slightly from their geographically close relatives. In contrast, feral mice shared a biomechanical signature corresponding to a decrease in the superficial masseter/molar mechanical advantage, suggesting poorer molar biting performance. This is interpreted as a parallel response to a relaxation of environmental pressure, possibly due to a diet shift in feral habitats. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London.","adaptation; biomechanics; commensalism; mandible morphology; morphometrics; rodent evolution","adaptation; biomechanics; commensalism; domestication; environmental factor; evolution; morphology; morphometry; phylogeny; rodent; wild population; French Southern Territories; Kerguelen Islands; Orkney; Scotland; United Kingdom; Animalia; Mus; Mus musculus; Mus musculus domesticus; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062874062

Although this strait is thought to have become narrower during the Last Glacial Maximum, it did not close completely to form a land bridge. Sea-level drawdown associated with cooling nevertheless weakened the influence of the Tsugaru Strait as a barrier to faunal migration. The currently accepted hypothesis is that only some large and highly mobile ungulates were able to migrate to Honshu over this strait to the exclusion of small mammals. However, this remains problematic as very few fossils corroborate this idea, and quantitative identification methods for use with tiny fragments of teeth have not been developed. In this study, we determine which of the species Lepus timidus (now distributed on Hokkaido and to the north) and Lepus brachyurus (now mainly distributed on Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu) can accurately be identified within a sample of Late Pleistocene Lepus sp. fossils recently unearthed from the Shitsukari-Abe cave to the immediate south of the Tsugaru Strait. This is because we are unable to exclude the possibility that these fossils are referable to L. timidus on the basis of site location alone. Thus, utilising images of mandibular third premolar teeth obtained via microcomputed tomography scanning, we report (a) linear measurements, (b) a survey of the frequency of appearance of nonmetric traits, and (c) principal component analysis using landmark methods. The results show that fossil representatives of the genus Lepus can be differentiated from extant L. timidus and closely resemble L. brachyurus. Considering the past allopatric distribution of the 2 species suggested by other studies as well as fossil records around the Tsugaru Strait, this result corroborates the existing hypothesis that only large and highly mobile ungulates were able to navigate the Tsugaru Strait.
