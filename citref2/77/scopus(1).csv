The resulting multitude of plausible trees is best expressed by a network which displays alternative potential evolutionary paths in the form of cycles. We present a method ('median joining' [MJ]) for constructing networks from recombination- free population data that combines features of Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees by favoring short connections, and Farris's maximum-parsimony (MP) heuristic algorithm, which sequentially adds new vertices called 'median vectors', except that our MJ method does not resolve ties. The MJ method is hence closely related to the earlier approach of Foulds, Hendy, and Penny for estimating MP trees but can be adjusted to the level of homoplasy by setting a parameter ε. Unlike our earlier reduced median (RM) network method, MJ is applicable to multistate characters (e.g., amino acid sequences). An additional feature is the speed of the implemented algorithm: a sample of 800 worldwide mtDNA hypervariable segment I sequences requires less than 3 h on a Pentium 120 PC. The MJ method is demonstrated on a Tibetan mitochondrial DNA RFLP data set.","Human mitochondrial DNA; Networks; Parsimony; Phylogeny construction","mitochondrial DNA; algorithm; amino acid sequence; article; genetic analysis; genetic recombination; molecular evolution; nonhuman; phylogeny; sequence analysis; species differentiation",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032900678

In large measure these advances are attributable to new methods for documenting domestication in plants and animals. The initial steps toward plant and animal domestication in the Eastern Mediterranean can now be pushed back to the 12th millennium cal B.P. Evidence for herd management and crop cultivation appears at least 1,000 years earlier than the morphological changes traditionally used to document domestication. Different species seem to have been domesticated in different parts of the Fertile Crescent, with genetic analyses detecting multiple domestic lineages for each species. Recent evidence suggests that the expansion of domesticates and agricultural economies across the Mediterranean was accomplished by several waves of seafaring colonists who established coastal farming enclaves around the Mediterranean Basin. This process also involved the adoption of domesticates and domestic technologies by indigenous populations and the local domestication of some endemic species. Human environmental impacts are seen in the complete replacement of endemic island faunas by imported mainland fauna and in today's anthropogenic, but threatened, Mediterranean landscapes where sustainable agricultural practices have helped maintain high biodiversity since the Neolithic.","Archaeology; Livestock","agriculture; archeology; crop management; domestication; environmental impact; farming system; genetic analysis; haplotype; Mediterranean Sea; Mesolithic; nonhuman; priority journal; review; sex difference; Agriculture; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Archaeology; Diffusion; Environment; Geography; History, Ancient; Humans; Mediterranean Region; Population Dynamics; Time Factors; Animalia",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-50149121968

Despite decades of research, no consensus has emerged about the extent of admixture between the indigenous and exotic populations or the degree to which the appearance of specific components of the ""Neolithic cultural package"" in Europe reflects truly independent development. Here, through the use of mitochondrial DNA from 323 modern and 221 ancient pig specimens sampled across western Eurasia, we demonstrate that domestic pigs of Near Eastern ancestry were definitely introduced into Europe during the Neolithic (potentially along two separate routes), reaching the Paris Basin by at least the early 4th millennium B.C. Local European wild boar were also domesticated by this time, possibly as a direct consequence of the introduction of Near Eastern domestic pigs. Once domesticated, European pigs rapidly replaced the introduced domestic pigs of Near Eastern origin throughout Europe. Domestic pigs formed a key component of the Neolithic Revolution, and this detailed genetic record of their origins reveals a complex set of interactions and processes during the spread of early farmers into Europe. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","European colonization; mtDNA; Phylogeography","mitochondrial DNA; article; DNA determination; domestic pig; domestication; Europe; evolution; human; migration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; phylogeography; priority journal; swine; unindexed sequence; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34848916115

However, the nature and speed of this transition is a matter of continuing scientific debate in archaeology, anthropology, and human population genetics. To date, inferences about the genetic make up of past populations have mostly been drawn from studies of modern-day Eurasian populations, but increasingly ancient DNA studies offer a direct view of the genetic past. We genetically characterized a population of the earliest farming culture in Central Europe, the Linear Pottery Culture (LBK; 5,500-4,900 calibrated B.C.) and used comprehensive phylogeographic and population genetic analyses to locate its origins within the broader Eurasian region, and to trace potential dispersal routes into Europe. We cloned and sequenced the mitochondrial hypervariable segment I and designed two powerful SNP multiplex PCR systems to generate new mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal data from 21 individuals from a complete LBK graveyard at Derenburg Meerenstieg II in Germany. These results considerably extend the available genetic dataset for the LBK (n = 42) and permit the first detailed genetic analysis of the earliest Neolithic culture in Central Europe (5,500-4,900 calibrated B.C.). We characterized the Neolithic mitochondrial DNA sequence diversity and geographical affinities of the early farmers using a large database of extant Western Eurasian populations (n =23,394) and a wide range of population genetic analyses including shared haplotype analyses, principal component analyses, multidimensional scaling, geographic mapping of genetic distances, and Bayesian Serial Simcoal analyses. The results reveal that the LBK population shared an affinity with the modern-day Near East and Anatolia, supporting a major genetic input from this area during the advent of farming in Europe. However, the LBK population also showed unique genetic features including a clearly distinct distribution of mitochondrial haplogroup frequencies, confirming that major demographic events continued to take place in Europe after the early Neolithic. © 2010 Haak et al.",,"mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial DNA; Antiquity; article; DNA synthesis; DNA template; gene mapping; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic variability; geographic distribution; haplotype; human; molecular cloning; Neolithic; phylogeny; population genetics; population research; single nucleotide polymorphism; Y chromosome; agriculture; Europe; fossil; genetics; migration; Agriculture; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Europe; Fossils; Humans",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649929790

The precise origins and dispersal routes of the Austronesian peoples and the associated Lapita culture remain contentious, and numerous disparate models of dispersal (based primarily on linguistic, genetic, and archeological data) have been proposed. Here, through the use of mtDNA from 781 modern and ancient Sus specimens, we provide evidence for an early human-mediated translocation of the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) to Flores and Timor and two later separate human-mediated dispersals of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) through Island Southeast Asia into Oceania. Of the later dispersal routes, one is unequivocally associated with the Neolithic (Lapita) and later Polynesian migrations and links modern and archeological Javan, Sumatran, Wallacean, and Oceanic pigs with mainland Southeast Asian S. scrofa. Archeological and genetic evidence shows these pigs were certainly introduced to islands east of the Wallace Line, including New Guinea, and that so-called ""wild"" pigs within this region are most likely feral descendants of domestic pigs introduced by early agriculturalists. The other later pig dispersal links mainland East Asian pigs to western Micronesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines. These results provide important data with which to test current models for human dispersal in the region. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Domestication; mtDNA; Pacific colonization; Phylogeography","mitochondrial DNA; animal tissue; article; DNA determination; domestic pig; geological time; migration; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Pacific islands; paleoanthropology; paleoenvironment; phylogeography; population movement pattern; priority journal; Southeast Asia; swine; unindexed sequence; animal; Bayes theorem; genetics; geography; haplotype; history; molecular genetics; phylogeny; population migration; principal component analysis; swine; Gabaza; Suidae; Sus; Sus celebensis; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica; Animal Migration; Animals; Asia, Southeastern; Bayes Theorem; DNA, Mitochondrial; Geography; Haplotypes; History, Ancient; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceania; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Swine",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247626810

The aurochs is the wild progenitor of modern cattle, but it is unclear whether European aurochs contributed to this process. To provide new insights into the demographic history of aurochs and domestic cattle, we have generated high-confidence mitochondrial DNA sequences from 59 archaeological skeletal finds, which were attributed to wild European cattle populations based on their chronological date and/or morphology. All pre-Neolithic aurochs belonged to the previously designated P haplogroup, indicating that this represents the Late Glacial Central European signature. We also report one new and highly divergent haplotype in a Neolithic aurochs sample from Germany, which points to greater variability during the Pleistocene. Furthermore, the Neolithic and Bronze Age samples that were classified with confidence as European aurochs using morphological criteria all carry P haplotype mitochondrial DNA, suggesting continuity of Late Glacial and Early Holocene aurochs populations in Europe. Bayesian analysis indicates that recent population growth gives a significantly better fit to our data than a constant-sized population, an observation consistent with a postglacial expansion scenario, possibly from a single European refugial population. Previous work has shown that most ancient and modern European domestic cattle carry haplotypes previously designated T. This, in combination with our new finding of a T haplotype in a very Early Neolithic site in Syria, lends persuasive support to a scenario whereby gracile Near Eastern domestic populations, carrying predominantly T haplotypes, replaced P haplotype-carrying robust autochthonous aurochs populations in Europe, from the Early Neolithic onward. During the period of coexistence, it appears that domestic cattle were kept separate from wild aurochs and introgression was extremely rare. © 2007 The Royal Society.","Ancient DNA; Aurochs; Domestication; Mitochondrial haplotypes; Starburst network","mitochondrial DNA; archaeological evidence; Bayesian analysis; cattle; coexistence; demographic history; divergence; domestication; late glacial; local extinction; mitochondrial DNA; Neolithic; Pleistocene; population growth; skeletal remains; article; Bayes theorem; cattle; DNA determination; DNA sequence; domestication; Europe; haplotype; Holocene; introgression; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; population growth; priority journal; sequence analysis; Syrian Arab Republic; Asia; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Middle East; Syrian Arab Republic; Bos; Bos primigenius; Bos taurus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447300408

The extent of these problems is inversely related to DNA concentration and target fragment size and concern (i) sample contamination, (ii) laboratory surface contamination, (iii) carry-over contamination, and (iv) contamination of reagents. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we performed a quantitative evaluation of current decontamination methods for these last three sources of contamination, and developed a new procedure to eliminate contaminating DNA contained in PCR reagents. We observed that most current decontamination methods are either not efficient enough to degrade short contaminating DNA molecules, rendered inefficient by the reagents themselves, or interfere with the PCR when used at doses high enough to eliminate these molecules. We also show that efficient reagent decontamination can be achieved by using a combination of treatments adapted to different reagent categories. Our procedure involves γ- and UV-irradiation and treatment with a mutant recombinant heat-labile double-strand specific DNase from the Antarctic shrimp Pandalus borealis. Optimal performance of these treatments is achieved in narrow experimental conditions that have been precisely analyzed and defined herein. Conclusions/Significance: There is not a single decontamination method valid for all possible contamination sources occurring in PCR reagents and in the molecular biology laboratory and most common decontamination methods are not efficient enough to decontaminate short DNA fragments of low concentration.

Though many variable traits found in domestic animals are the result of relatively recent human-mediated selection, uncertainty remains as to whether the modern ubiquity of long-standing variable traits such as coat color results from selection or drift, and whether the underlying alleles were present in the wild ancestor or appeared after domestication began. Here, through an investigation of sequence diversity at the porcine melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) locus, we provide evidence that wild and domestic pig (Sus scrofa) haplotypes from China and Europe are the result of strikingly different selection pressures, and that coat color variation is the result of intentional selection for alleles that appeared after the advent of domestication. Asian and European wild boar (evolutionarily distinct subspecies) differed only by synonymous substitutions, demonstrating that camouflage coat color is maintained by purifying selection. In domestic pigs, however, each of nine unique mutations altered the amino acid sequence thus generating coat color diversity. Most domestic MC1R alleles differed by more than one mutation from the wild-type, implying a long history of strong positive selection for coat color variants, during which time humans have cherry-picked rare mutations that would be quickly eliminated in wild contexts. This pattern demonstrates that coat color phenotypes result from direct human selection and not via a simple relaxation of natural selective pressures. © 2009 Fang et al.",,"melanocortin 1 receptor; melanocortin 1 receptor; allele; amino acid sequence; article; gene locus; gene sequence; genetic trait; genetic variability; haplotype; molecular evolution; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phenotype; swine; wild type; animal; genetic selection; genetics; hair color; phylogeny; swine; wild animal; Animalia; Sus; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica; Alleles; Animals; Animals, Wild; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Variation; Hair Color; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Receptor, Melanocortin, Type 1; Selection (Genetics); Sus scrofa",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-59249105970

Ideology (as reflected in material culture and monument building) changed abruptly. To achieve the required decoupling, subsistence is therefore portrayed as having changed slowly. This implies three things: (1) Mesolithic foragers were gradually intensifying their subsistence economy. (2) Neolithic people subsisted mainly on wild animals and plants and were nomadic. (3) Subsistence change across the ideological transition was slow, continuous, and seamless. Many other scholars, although not post-processualists, have come to accept these three points. But as the post-processual view has become the consensus, the data from Britain, Ireland, and southern Scandinavia have all been leading in the opposite direction: (1) There is no reason to think that Mesolithic foragers were intensifying eco-nomically. (2) Neolithic people subsisted mainly on cultivated plants and domestic animals and were fully sedentary. (3) The transition to agriculture was rapid and probably traumatic.

Most claims of a little agriculture in Late Mesolithic communities are shown to be incorrect. In most places, full sedentary agriculture was introduced very rapidly at the start of the Neolithic. ""Transitional"" economies are virtually absent. Consequently, the long-term processes of internal development from forager to farmer, so often discussed in Mesolithic-Neolithic Europe, are increasingly hard to sustain. The spread of agriculture by immigration is thus an increasingly viable explanation. The crucial role of boats for transport and of dairying for the survival of new farming settlements are both highlighted. Farming migrations were punctuated and sporadic, not a single wave of advance. Consequently, there was much genetic mixing as farming spread, so that agricultural immigrants into any region carried a majority of native European Mesolithic genes, not Near Eastern ones. © 2011 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

The sequences were analyzed together with a previously published sequence representing a Swedish domestic pig. The sequences formed three distinct clades, denoted A, E1, and E2, with considerable sequence divergence between them (0.8-1.2%). The results confirm our previous study (based on the sequence of the cytochrome B gene and the control region only) and provide compelling evidence that domestication of pigs must have occurred from both an Asian and a European subspecies of the wild boar. We estimated the time since the divergence of clade A (found in Chinese Meishan pigs) and E1 (found in European domestic pigs) at about 900,000 years before present, long before domestication about 9000 years ago. The pattern of nucleotide substitutions among the sequences was in good agreement with previous interspecific comparisons of mammalian mtDNA; the lowest substitution rates were observed at nonsynonymous sites in protein-coding genes, in the tRNA and rRNA genes, while the highest rates were observed at synonymous sites and in the control region. The presence of Asian clade A in some major European breeds (Large White and Landrace) most likely reflects the documented introgression of Asian germplasm into European stocks during the 18th and 19th centuries. The coexistence of such divergent mtDNA haplotypes for 100+ generations is expected to lead to the presence of recombinant haplotypes if paternal transmission and recombination occur at a low frequency. We found no evidence of such recombination events in the limited sample studied so far.","Domestication; Mitochondrial DNA; Phylogeny; Sus scrofa","mitochondrial DNA; cytochrome b; mitochondrial DNA; amino acid substitution; animal cell; article; genetic analysis; genetic recombination; haplotype; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; sequence analysis; swine; molecular evolution; phylogeny; sequence homology; swine; Animalia; Mammalia; Pieris brassicae; Sus; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035023792

Understanding the relative roles of ancient and recent events in shaping the genetic structure of this species is therefore not only an interesting scientific issue, but it represents also the basis for addressing future management strategies. In addition, several pig breeds descend from the European wild boar, but the geographical location of the domestication area(s) and the possible introgression of pig genomes into wild populations are still open questions. Here, we analysed the genetic variation in different wild boar populations in Europe. Ten polymorphic microsatellites were typed in 252 wild boars and the mtDNA control region was sequenced in a subset of 145 individuals. Some samples from different pig breeds were also analysed. Our results, which were obtained considering also 612 published mtDNA sequences, suggest that (i) most populations are similarly differentiated, but the major discontinuity is found along the Alps; (ii) except for the Italian populations, European wild boars show the signature of a postglacial demographic expansion; (iii) Italian populations seem to preserve a high proportion of preglaciation diversity; (iv) the demographic decline which occurred in some areas in the last few centuries did not produce a noticeable reduction of genetic variation; (v) signs of human-mediated gene flow among populations are weak, although in some regions the effects of translocations are detectable and a low degree of pig introgression can be identified; (vi) the hypothesis of an independent domestication centre in Italy is not supported by our data, which in turn confirm that Central European wild boar might have represented an important source for domestic breeds. We can therefore conclude that recent human activities had a limited effect on the wild boar genetic structure. It follows that areas with high variation and differentiation represent natural reservoirs of genetic diversity to be protected avoiding translocations. In this context controlling some populations by hunting is not expected to affect significantly genetic variation in this species. © 2008 The Authors.","Genetic diversity; Microsatellites; mtDNA; Phylogeography; Population expansion; Sus scrofa","microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; DNA sequence; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; hybridization; ice cover; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; swine; Animals; Base Sequence; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genotype; Hybridization, Genetic; Ice Cover; Microsatellite Repeats; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sus scrofa; Variation (Genetics); Suidae; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41249102825

Yet, despite more than a century of research, there is little consensus on the speed or completeness of this fundamental change and, consequently, on its principal drivers. For Northern Europe, the debate has often centered on the rich archaeological record of the Western Baltic, but even here it is unclear how quickly or completely people abandoned wild terrestrial and marine resources after the introduction of domesticated plants and animals at ∼4000 calibrated years B.C. Ceramic containers are found ubiquitously on these sites and contain remarkably well-preserved lipids derived from the original use of the vessel. Reconstructing culinary practices from this ceramic record can contribute to longstanding debates concerning the origins of farming. Here we present data on the molecular and isotopic characteristics of lipids extracted from 133 ceramic vessels and 100 carbonized surface residues dating to immediately before and after the first evidence of domesticated animals and plants in the Western Baltic. The presence of specific lipid biomarkers, notably ω-(o- alkylphenyl)alkanoic acids, and the isotopic composition of individual n-alkanoic acids clearly show that a significant proportion (∼20%) of ceramic vessels with lipids preserved continued to be used for processing marine and freshwater resources across the transition to agriculture in this region. Although changes in pottery use are immediately evident, our data challenge the popular notions that economies were completely transformed with the arrival of farming and that Neolithic pottery was exclusively associated with produce from domesticated animals and plants.","GC-combustion-isotope ratio MS; Isotope; Mesolithic; Organic residue analysis; Paleodiet","alkanoic acid; carbon 13; lipid; omega (2 alkylphenyl) alkanoic acid; unclassified drug; agriculture; article; Baltic Sea; ceramics; chemical composition; domestication; Europe; food processing; nonhuman; priority journal; Agriculture; Biological Markers; Cooking; Europe; Animalia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-81055145482

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables.

The dates from the LBK sites form a statistically homogeneous set with the probability distribution similar to a single-date Gaussian curve. This implies that the duration of the spread of the LBK is shorter than the available temporal resolution of the radiocarbon dating; therefore, the rate of spread must be larger than 4 km/yr, in agreement with earlier estimates. The East European sites exhibit a broad probability distribution of dates. We identify in these data a spatio-temporal sequence from south-east to north-west, which implies the rate of spread of the initial pottery-making of the order of 1.6 km/yr, comparable to the average rate of spread of the Neolithic in Western and Central Europe.

One technique commonly used to eliminate the presence of DNA is ultraviolet (UV) irradiation; we optimized such a protocol used in the treatment of water, tubes, plates, and tips for low copy number DNA (LCN) amplification. UV light from a Stratalinker® 2400 was administered to 0.2, 1.5 mL tubes, and PCR plates contaminated with up to 500 pg of DNA. They were subsequently quantified with an ALU-based real-time PCR method using the Rotorgene 3000. Overall, there was a decrease in concentration of DNA recovered as the duration of treatment increased. Nonetheless, following 45 min of irradiating a PCR plate with 500 pg of DNA, nearly 6 pg were still detected. However, when the plate was raised within an inch of the UV source, less than 0.2 pg of DNA was detected. Additionally, lining the area around the samples with aluminum foil further reduced the amount of time necessary for irradiation, as only 30 min eliminated the presence DNA in the raised PCR plate. Similar experiments were conducted using tubes filled with a solution of DNA and water in equivalent concentrations for 50, 15, and 1.5 mL tubes with comparative results. It is plausible that the aluminum foil increased the amount of reflection in the area thereby enhancing penetration of UV rays through the walls of the plasticware. This protocol was tested for the possibility of inhibitors produced from irradiation of plastic tubes. As our protocols require less irradiation time than previous studies, PCR sensitivity was not affected. Moreover, the lifespan of the UV lamps was extended. Our findings demonstrate that this method is useful as an additional precautionary measure to prevent amplification of extraneous DNA from plasticware and water without compromising the sensitivity of LCN DNA amplifications.

A polymorphic D-loop fragment (∼270 bp) was amplified and sequenced in a number of wild and domestic Sus scrofa meat samples, to find a nucleotide region suitable for PCR-RFLP analysis. Sequence data showed the presence of only a few point mutations across Sus scrofa D-loop sequences, not allowing direct discrimination between wild boar and domestic swine meats. Later, the MC1R gene was targeted and Sus scrofa-specific primers designed to amplify a 795 bp MC1R fragment. Subsequent RFLP analysis of the MC1R swine-specific amplicons allowed selection of BspHI and BstUI endonucleases to carry out intraspecific Sus scrofa differentiation. Digestion of MC1R amplicons with the chosen enzymes generated characteristic PCR-RFLP profiles that allowed discrimination among meats from wild and domestic swine specimens. The technique also enabled the detection of samples that yielded heterozygous profiles, suggesting hybrids resulting from wild boar and domestic pig breeding. The PCR-RFLP reported here, targeting the MC1R gene may be routinely applied to verify the correct labelling of game products. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Metrical methods are the most commonly used; these are reviewed. Assemblages containing a wider range of measurements (as measured by the coefficient of variation [V]) than is found in one population suggest that two populations of different-sized pigs were present, probably indicating separate wild and domestic populations with little or no interbreeding. These assemblages, sometimes taken to indicate animals 'intermediate' between wild and domestic, are clear evidence of full domestication. Other traditional means of diagnosing domestication based on age at death (the killing of many young animals) and biogeography (the export of the animal beyond its natural range, especially to islands) are particularly problematic when applied to pigs. New methods include the frequency of Linear Enamel Hypoplasia, which may increase due to domestication-induced stress, the study of diet through isotopes and dental microwear, and the examination of population histories through ancient and modern DNA and geometric morphometrics. These are all promising but should not be considered in isolation: many problems remain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Domestic pig; Domestication; Methods; Old World; Wild boar","archaeological evidence; diet; DNA; domestication; historical perspective; isolation effect; morphometry; pig; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858599203

Three such selective sweeps are described in this review. All three mutations are intronic and constitute cis-acting regulatory mutations. Two of the mutations constitute structural changes (one duplication and one copy number expansion). These examples illustrate a general trend that noncoding mutations and structural changes have both contributed significantly to the evolution of phenotypic diversity in domestic animals. How the molecular characterization of trait loci in domestic animals can provide new basic knowledge of relevance for human medicine is discussed. © 2011 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.","Comparative genomics; Intronic mutations; Regulatory mutations; Structural variation","microphthalmia associated transcription factor; nuclear receptor NR4A3; somatomedin B; transcription factor Sox5; animal genetics; broiler; copy number variation; domestic animal; epigenetics; gene locus; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic predisposition; genotype phenotype correlation; horse; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; intron; muscle growth; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; priority journal; quantitative trait locus mapping; review; selective sweep; single nucleotide polymorphism; tandem repeat; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Biological Processes; Genomic Structural Variation; Genomics; Horses; Muscle, Skeletal; Mutation; Phenotype",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-83855162824

Mitochondrial DNA analysis shows a Near Eastern origin for domestic cattle and no indication of comestication of European aurochs. Proc. Biol. Sci. 274, 1377-1385; Troy, C.S., MacHugh, D.E., Bailey, J.F., Magee, D.A., Lotfus, R.T., Cunningham, P., Chamberlain, A.T., Sykes, B.C., Bradley, D.G., 2001. Genetic evidence for near-Eastern origins of European cattle. Nature 410, 1088-1091). This observation is generally consistent with the observation of archaeo-zoologists, but there are exceptions. As cattle domestication is associated with size reduction, wild and domesticated individuals have usually been differentiated by measuring the size of the bones. But this criteria is complicated by a pronounced sexual dimorphism that makes it difficult to discriminate between male domestic cattle and female aurochs. In particular, several bone samples from the mainly terminal Mesolithic site Rosenhof LA 58 in northernmost Germany have provoked intense discussion because they are smaller than the minimum known size of Scandinavian female aurochs. Therefore, some scholars have argued that they represent the first and possibly locally domesticated bovines of the northern European Mesolithic. To clarify the status of the Rosenhof ""cattle"", we determined the mtDNA-haplotype and sex of four of these presumed Mesolithic domesticates. We also analysed one early Neolithic sample and four Mesolithic robust and therefore morphologically definite wild aurochs from Rosenhof. For the purposes of comparison, we also determined the mtDNA haplotypes of seven samples from the adjacent Neolithic site of Wangels. The Neolithic samples from Wangels and Rosenhof revealed lineages that are typical of imported taurine cattle. In contrast, the four wild aurochs and the four presumed Mesolithic domesticates from Rosenhof yielded mtDNA sequences that are characteristic for European aurochs. Furthermore, all the proposed domestics from Rosenhof were female individuals while three out of four remains from Rosenhof's confirmed aurochs were males. As the four bones in question are too large to belong to female domesticates it is highly likely that they stem from wild female aurochs that were smaller than previously thought. Our data thus indicate that the beginning of cattle husbandry in Northern Germany did not predate, but is rather linked to the Neolithic transition. The single Neolithic Rosenhof domestic revealed an early radiocarbon date of 4000 ± 50 cal BC and marks the onset of the Neolithic in Northern Europe. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the genetic composition of populations after the earliest Neolithic, when a diverse mosaic of societies that had been fully engaged in agriculture for some time appeared in central Europe, is poorly known. At this period during the Late Neolithic (ca. 2,800-2,000 BC), regionally distinctive burial patterns associated with two different cultural groups emerge, Bell Beaker and Corded Ware, and may reflect differences in how these societies were organized. Ancient DNA analyses of human remains from the Late Neolithic Bell Beaker site of Kromsdorf, Germany showed distinct mitochondrial haplotypes for six individuals, which were classified under the haplogroups I1, K1, T1, U2, U5, and W5, and two males were identified as belonging to the Y haplogroup R1b. In contrast to other Late Neolithic societies in Europe emphasizing maintenance of biological relatedness in mortuary contexts, the diversity of maternal haplotypes evident at Kromsdorf suggests that burial practices of Bell Beaker communities operated outside of social norms based on shared maternal lineages. Furthermore, our data, along with those from previous studies, indicate that modern U5-lineages may have received little, if any, contribution from the Mesolithic or Neolithic mitochondrial gene pool.

Common variations (polymorphisms) in the MC1R gene are associated with normal differences in skin and hair colour. So far, a unique MC1R allele (E+) has been identified in European wild boar (Sus scrofa scrofa), associated with the wild-type coat colour (variable shades of brown) that is not found in any of the domestic breeds. In addition, a series of alleles found in pigs, some of which observed only in particular breeds, have been proposed as markers in breed traceability systems. The current study is an attempt to detect possible hybrids between wild boars and domestic pig breeds as well as to identify races of pig that are not purebred. For this purpose, wild boars were analysed against Large White pigs, applying the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. A high percentage (16.7%) of hybrids was detected within a breeding station compared with the percentage of hybrids within the populations of free-ranging wild boar (5.0%). These results should be taken into consideration for future restocking operations to avoid the chance of outbreeding depression, which is more intense when local populations are introgressed by gene pools from domesticated, usually inbred, animals. © 2008 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.","hybrids; MC1R; Sus scrofa","domestic species; gene expression; genetic marker; hybrid; introgression; mutation; pig; polymerase chain reaction; polymorphism; wild population; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe; Animalia; Mammalia; Pieris brassicae; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica; Sus scrofa scrofa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-72049113859
