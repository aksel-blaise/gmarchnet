As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

With the simultaneous use of five characters of the hip bone, it is possible to provide a correct sexual diagnosis in 95% of all cases, with an error of 2% and an inability to identify sex in only 3%. The advantage of this new method is a reduction in observer subjectivity, since the evaluation procedure cannot involve any anticipation of the result. In addition, this method of sex determination increases the probability of a correct diagnosis with isolated fragments of the hip bone, provided that a combination of elements of one character is found to be typically male or female. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Human pelvis; Method; Morphological traits; Sex determination","article; controlled study; error; female; hip; human; male; methodology; sex determination; visual system",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036159009

Yet many research sites may contain such materials. Without a framework for identifying the bones or the excavation techniques suited to their recovery, archaeologists may often overlook subadult skeletal remains or even confuse them with animal bones. The Osteology of Infants and Children fills the need for a field and lab manual on this important topic and provides a supplemental textbook for human osteology courses. Focusing on juvenile skeletons, their recovery and identification, and siding in both field and lab settings, the volume provides basic descriptions and careful illustrations of each skeletal element at varying stages of development, along with sections on differentiation from other bones and siding tips. The book offers detailed treatment of the skull and teeth, including the cranial vault and facial bones, and examines the infracranial skeleton: vertebrae, pelvis, chest, shoulders, arms, hands, legs, and feet. A quick reference guide explains age estimation and identification templates. The illustrations are enhanced by photographs from two recent archaeology projects in Egypt, at Abydos and Dakhleh Oasis. The extensive collection of fetal and child remains from these sites provides new reference material unavailable in previous publications, making this manual an unparalleled resource in the field of physical anthropology.

In this study, it was found that, first, the alternative pubis measurement, known as the superior pubis ramus length (SPRL), can be collected more reliably with less mean intra-observer error (0.57%) than the more commonly used manner of measuring the pubis (2.7%). Second, a logistic regression sex determination method using the SPRL, along with other measurements of the hipbone and femur, has an allocation accuracy of 90% to 98.5% (depending on the model used and the manner of testing) across independent samples. Third, traditional racial categorization was irrelevant to the accuracy of the method. Fourth, measurement error greater than 2% in the measurement of the pubis can be the difference between a correct and an incorrect allocation of sex, particularly in borderline cases.","Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Human identification; Pelvis; Sex determination; Skeletal","adult; articular cartilage; conference paper; female; forensic identification; forensic science; geographic distribution; hip; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; measurement; physical anthropology; priority journal; reproducibility; sampling; sex determination; Anthropometry; Female; Femur; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Metric System; Observer Variation; Pelvic Bones; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Characteristics",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037346533

The chance of attaining a high level of accuracy regarding sex allocations is related to the skeletal component analyzed and the ability of the techniques employed to describe shape and size differences among the sexes. Current opinion regards the hip bone as the most reliable sex indicator because it is the most dimorphic bone, particularly in adult individuals. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the greater sciatic notch and the ischiopubic complex morphology by employing geometric morphometric techniques, based on semilandmark and multivariate statistical methods, in order to develop a reliable and accurate technique for adult sex estimation. The sample analyzed consisted of 121 adult left hip bones randomly selected from the collection of documented skeletons housed at the Museu Antropologico de Coimbra. Morphometric analysis was based on coordinates of landmarks and semilandmarks of the ilium and ischiopubic regions that were digitized on 2D photographic images. Discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation and k-means clustering of shape and shape-size variables were used in order to classify individuals by sex. For the greater sciatic notch, average accuracy of 90.9% was achieved with both multivariate analyses based on shape variables. For the ischiopubic complex, the values obtained with shape variables were 93.4% and 90.1% for discriminant and k-means, respectively. Females were misclassified more frequently than males, especially for the ischiopubic complex. When multivariate statistical analyses were performed using shape-size variables, the percentages of correct classifications were lower than those obtained with shape variables. We conclude that the use of geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics is a reliable method to quantify pelvic shape differences between the sexes and could be applied to discriminate between females and males. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Eight previously proposed nonmetric traits of the ilia and mandible have been demonstrated by other researchers to be related to the known-sex of subadults, yet there has been relatively little research attempting to evaluate the utility of these traits using independent collections of known-sex subadult skeletal remains. These eight traits include: elevation of the auricular surface, angle of the greater sciatic notch, depth of the greater sciatic notch, the ""arch criteria,"" curvature of the iliac crest, gonial eversion, mandibular protrusion, and mandibular arcade shape. The present study blindly tested these eight nonmetric traits using 85 autopsied prehistoric known-sex mummified subadult remains from northern Chile that range in age between newborn and 15 skeletal years of age. The two primary questions examined for each trait are: (1) are the different character states for each of the eight traits related to known-sex, and (2) which of the eight traits are accurate enough for use in forensic cases? These questions are examined for each trait by both sex and age class so as to uncover potential sex- and age-related strengths and weaknesses for each of the characteristics. The results indicate that all eight of the previously proposed subadult sex-related traits are indeed related to known-sex, but that there is a great deal of variation by both sex and age in terms of the strength of congruent sex-related associations. With the exception of gonial eversion, all of the traits produced statistically significant X2 values for their associations with known-sex when all subadult remains were considered. However, when all subadults are considered, only four traits demonstrated acceptable levels of accuracy for forensic applications. These traits include the arch criteria (82.3%), angle of the sciatic notch (80.7%), depth of the sciatic notch (79.0%), and mandibular arcade shape (77.6%). For subadults ranging in age from newborn to five skeletal years of age, only depth of the sciatic notch (81.5%) and the arch criteria (81.5%) approach acceptable levels of accuracy for use in forensic cases. The implications of these results are discussed and recommendations for bioarchaeological and forensic applications are made.","Bioarchaeology; Forensic anthropology; Forensic science; Human identification; Juvenile","accuracy; adolescent; age distribution; archeology; child; Chile; conference paper; female; forensic science; human; iliac bone; iliac crest; infant; major clinical study; male; mandible; newborn; paleopathology; physical anthropology; priority journal; sex determination; skeleton; Adolescent; Age Factors; Anthropometry; Child; Child, Preschool; Chile; Female; Forensic Anthropology; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mummies; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Sex Characteristics",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042320315

The principal component analysis (PCA) performed on shape variables shows a large superposition of both sexes, suggesting a relatively low degree of dimorphism in shape. As a consequence, the average percentages of correct sex estimations based on these variables were of 60.12 and 68.90%, obtained by discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross validation and k-means clustering respectively. Conversely, when centroid size is included in PCA, females and males exhibit large separation along the first component. The highest values of correct assignment (77.86 and 72.15%) were found using shape-size variables with discriminant and k-means clustering analysis, indicating that the traits analysed display marked sex differences related to the larger size and more robust features of males. Finally, the advantages of geometric morphometric techniques are discussed. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cranial sex; Discriminant analysis; K-means clustering; Semilandmarks",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251470148

The sample comprises adult and subadult individuals selected from the Lisbon documented skeletal collection, housed at the National Museum of Natural History in Lisbon, Portugal. Faciolingual and mesiodistal diameters were the tooth dimensions utilized. In the first approach, sex-specific logistic regression formulae based on adult tooth dimensions are developed and then used to determine the sex of the subadult sample. The second and third approaches are based on the sectioning point procedure, which uses the overall mean of a measurement (tooth diameter) collected from the sample as the discriminant criteria for determining the sex of the individuals in that sample. While in the second approach the adult overall mean of each dimension is used as the discriminant criteria for determining the sex of the subadults, in the third approach it is the subadult overall mean of each dimension that comprises the discriminant criteria that is applied back to the subadults for determining sex. Results show that the canines are the teeth with the highest sexual dimorphism and methods of sex determination based on canine dimensions provide correct allocation accuracies between 58.8% and 100% depending on the diameter and the approach that is being used. Canine faciolingual dimensions provide the best overall results. Combinations of measurements from the same and different teeth do not increase significantly the accuracy of the methods and approaches. Some of the problems of subadult sex determination methods based on adult tooth dimensions result from differing levels of sexual dimorphism between the adult and subadult segment of the sample. Mortality or cultural bias may increase or decrease the sexual dimorphism of the subadults compared to the adults. Small subadult samples utilized in this study may also raise questions regarding the accuracy of the three different sample-specific approaches. However, high consistency of results using the canine and different approaches, suggests that adult and subadult canine dimensions can be reliable sex discriminators of immature skeletal remains in archaeological samples. The major advantage of the approaches presented here is that they can be used to derive sample-specific methods and, therefore, eliminate the problem of applying morphological or metric methods to individuals originating from a population that differs from the one that contributed to the development of the method. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

One such trait is the arch criterion found in subadult ilia, which is defined relative to the greater sciatic notch-auricular surface area. In adults, the composite arch has also been described in relation to this area and has proven relatively successful in sex determination. This study offers an examination of the accuracy of the arch criterion and the composite arch in determining the sex of subadult skeletal remains, and an assessment of intra- and inter-observer scoring error. A sample of 97 skeletons of known sex and age (<15 years) from the Lisbon collection (Portugal) were selected and the traits were scored by three observers on orthogonal photos of each ilium. In general the agreement within (67.7-88.5%) and between (50.5-76.3%) examiners was poor and overall accuracy (26.7-52.6%) did not meet the expectations of that reported in previous studies. The authors suggest that this derives from great variation in morphology, difficulties in interpreting criteria and possibly a lack of association between the expression of the traits and sex. Careful examination of sex-related morphology in the immature skeleton and additional blind tests of so-called useful traits should continue to be carried out. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This study uses a sample of 82 juvenile ilia from an identified Portuguese population (Lisbon collection) to test the cross-applicability of a new approach by Wilson et al. [23] that uses geometric morphometric methods to sex the subadult ilium. Further, we evaluate the wider applicability of these methods for forensic casework, extending the age range of the original study by examining an additional 19 juvenile ilia from the St. Brides and Spitalfields collections, housed in London. Levels of accuracy for the Portuguese sample (62.2-89.0%) indicate that the methods can be used to document dimorphism in another sample. Discriminant functions are sample-specific, indicated by not better than average classification using cross-validation. We propose a methodological update, whereby we recommend disuse of the auricular surface morphology criterion, based upon reduced success rates and inadequate accuracy of female identification. We show, in addition to population differences, differences in the ontogeny of dimorphism may lead to differing degrees of success for female identification using some criteria.

We use a geometric morphometric approach to quantitatively separate the ontogeny of size and shape of the ilium, and analyze interpopulation differences in the onset, rate and patterning of sexual dimorphism. We captured the shape of three traits for a total of 191 ilia from Lisbon (Portugal) and London (UK) samples of known age and sex (0-17 years). Our results indicate that a) there is a clear dissociation between the ontogeny of size and shape in males and females, b) the ontogeny of size and shape are each defined by nonlinear trajectories that differ between the sexes, c) there are interpopulation differences in ontogenetic shape trajectories, which point to population-specific patterning in the attainment of sexual dimorphism, and d) the rate of shape maturation and size maturation is typically higher for females than males. Male and female shape differences in the ilium are brought about by trajectory divergence. Differences in size and shape maturation between the sexes suggest that maturity may confound our ability to discriminate between the sexes by introducing variation not accounted for in age-based groupings. The accuracy of sex determination methods using the ilium may be improved by the use of different traits for particular age groups, to capture the ontogenetic development of shape in both sexes. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Development; Geometric morphometrics; Growth; Juvenile sex determination; Postcranial skeleton","adolescent; Article; bone maturation; bone shape; bone size; child; controlled study; female; geometry; groups by age; human; human tissue; iliac bone; iliac crest; infant; male; morphometrics; musculoskeletal system parameters; ontogeny; Portugal; preschool child; school child; sex determination; sex difference; surface property; United Kingdom; analysis of variance; anatomy and histology; growth, development and aging; iliac bone; newborn; physical anthropology; Adolescent; Analysis of Variance; Anthropology, Physical; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Ilium; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Sex Determination by Skeleton",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919444135

Also, the small number of osteological collections of children available for research has made it difficult to develop effective methodologies in this regard. This study tested the characteristics of the ilium and jaw proposed by Schutkowski in 1993 for estimation of sex in subadults. The study sample consisted of 109 boys and 76 girls, ranging in age from 5 months of gestation to 6 years, from the identified osteological collection of Granada (Spain). For the analysis and interpretation of the results, we have proposed changes from previous studies because we believe they raised methodological errors relating to the calculation of probabilities of success and sex distribution in the sample. The results showed correct assignment probabilities much lower than those obtained by Schutkowski as well as by other authors. The best results were obtained with the angle and depth of the sciatic notch, with 0.73 and 0.80 probability of correct assignment respectively if the male trait was observed. The results obtained with the other criteria were too small to be valid in the context of Physical or Forensic Anthropology. From our results, we concluded that Schutkowski method should not be used in forensic context, and that the sciatic notch is the most dimorphic trait in subadults and, therefore, the most appropriate to develop more effective methods for estimating sex. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Forensic anthropology; Ilium; Infant; Jaw; Sex estimation","anatomy and histology; chi square distribution; child; female; human; iliac bone; infant; male; mandible; newborn; preschool child; procedures; sex determination; validation study; Chi-Square Distribution; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Ilium; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mandible; Sex Determination by Skeleton",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961782295
