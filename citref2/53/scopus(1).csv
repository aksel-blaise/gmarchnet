Climatic Change 19, 53-61]. A minimal interpretation of the size of this corridor requires a narrow but continuous zone of open 'savanna' vegetation 50-150 km wide, running along the sand-covered divide between the modern South China and Java Seas. This area formed a land bridge between the Malaysian Peninsula and the major islands of Sumatra, Java and Borneo. The savanna corridor connected similar open vegetation types north and south of the equator, and served as a barrier to the dispersal of rainforest-dependent species between Sumatra and Borneo. A maximal interpretation of the available evidence is compatible with the existence of a broad savanna corridor, with forest restricted to refugia primarily in Sumatra, Borneo and the continental shelf beneath the modern South China Sea. This savanna corridor may have provided a convenient route for the rapid early dispersal of modern humans through the region and on into Australasia. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents one such case study: Niah Cave in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, famous for the discovery in 1958 in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of a modern human skull, the 'Deep Skull,' controversially associated with radiocarbon dates of ca. 40,000 years before the present. A new chronostratigraphy has been developed through a re-investigation of the lithostratigraphy left by the earlier excavations, AMS-dating using three different comparative pre-treatments including ABOX of charcoal, and U-series using the Diffusion-Absorption model applied to fragments of bones from the Deep Skull itself. Stratigraphic reasons for earlier uncertainties about the antiquity of the skull are examined, and it is shown not to be an 'intrusive' artifact. It was probably excavated from fluvial-pond-desiccation deposits that accumulated episodically in a shallow basin immediately behind the cave entrance lip, in a climate that ranged from times of comparative aridity with complete desiccation, to episodes of greater surface wetness, changes attributed to regional climatic fluctuations. Vegetation outside the cave varied significantly over time, including wet lowland forest, montane forest, savannah, and grassland. The new dates and the lithostratigraphy relate the Deep Skull to evidence of episodes of human activity that range in date from ca. 46,000 to ca. 34,000 years ago. Initial investigations of sediment scorching, pollen, palynomorphs, phytoliths, plant macrofossils, and starch grains recovered from existing exposures, and of vertebrates from the current and the earlier excavations, suggest that human foraging during these times was marked by habitat-tailored hunting technologies, the collection and processing of toxic plants for consumption, and, perhaps, the use of fire at some forest-edges. The Niah evidence demonstrates the sophisticated nature of the subsistence behavior developed by modern humans to exploit the tropical environments that they encountered in Southeast Asia, including rainforest. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies of tropical forest hunting and gathering peoples have contributed to our perceptions of the foraging way of life. Yet no peoples have ever been directly observed living independently of agriculture in tropical rain forest. This article tests the hypothesis that humans do not exist nor have ever existed independently of agriculture in tropical rain forest. We find no convincing ethnographic evidence and, with the possible exception of Malaysia, no archeological evidence for pure foragers in undisturbed tropical rain forests. Negative evidence cannot be conclusive, but it suggests that we need to carefully reexamine common assumptions concerning the recent history of tropical forest dwellers, the adaptability of preagricultural humans, the geographic and environmental range of hominids, and the form and consequences of selection pressures acting on humans in warm, humid environments. The overriding purpose of this article is to stimulate further ecological and archeological research in the neglected tropical forest areas of the world. 1989 American Anthropological Association",,"ethnographic evidence; foraging; hunter-gatherers; tropical rain forest",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024534553

We combine ethnographic observations of contemporary Aboriginal hunting and burning with satellite image analysis of anthropogenic and natural landscape structure to demonstrate the processes through which Aboriginal burning shapes arid-zone vegetational diversity. Anthropogenic landscapes contain a greater diversity of successional stages than landscapes under a lightning fire regime, and differences are of scale, not of kind. Landscape scale is directly linked to foraging for small, burrowed prey (monitor lizards), which is a specialty of Aboriginal women. The maintenance of small-scale habitat mosaics increases small-animal hunting productivity. These results have implications for understanding the unique biodiversity of the Australian continent, through time and space. In particular, anthropogenic influences on the habitat structure of paleolandscapes are likely to be spatially localized and linked to less mobile, broad-spectrum"" foraging economies. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Fire ecology; Human behavioral ecology; Hunter-gatherers; Resource management","Aborigine; animal hunting; anthropology; article; Australia; biodiversity; burn; controlled study; ethnography; fire; foraging; human; priority journal; vegetation; Aborigine; animal; anthropology; ecology; environmental protection; female; male; Animalia; Varanus; Animals; Anthropology; Australia; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Female; Fires; Humans; Male; Oceanic Ancestry Group",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-54449087072

A recent extension of the record to close to the base of the Quaternary from examination of an offshore core provides a broad regional and temporal context for evaluation of the true significance of late Quaternary changes. It is apparent that the major sustained change in the vegetation of the region occurred relatively recently, probably within the last 140,000 yr, and that this change was time transgressive. It involved the replacement of extensive moist rainforest by open eucalypt woodland and is considered to have been most likely caused by the burning activities of Aboriginal people.

We stress that humans construct their world largely to suit themselves and frequently buffer adaptive lag through cultural niche construction.

Our argument has implications for evolutionary psychology and human behavioral ecology, and suggests that the methods of the latter are potentially applicable to all human societies, even postindustrial ones.","Adaptive lag; Evolutionary psychology; Human behavioral ecology; Human evolution; Niche construction",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746166792

This pattern is repeated in two separate rainforest regions (natural replicates), between which populations have been separated for several million years. Despite evidence for isolation in rainforest refugia, historically reduced effective population size, and recent range expansion, little or no detectable phenotypic evolution has occurred among populations, even those isolated for several million years. These observations suggest that long-term isolation per se, even when combined with major reductions in population size and opportunities for drift and founder effects, is unlikely to be the primary process driving phenotypic divergence and speciation of rainforest vertebrates.","Pleistocene refugia; Speciation; Tropical rainforest","mitochondrial DNA; evolution; lizard; rainforest; article; Australia; climate; evolution; forest; founder effect; lizard; natural population; nonhuman; population dynamics; priority journal; species differentiation; tropics; Australia; Squamata; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033593286

Here, we present a broad overview of NCT and discuss its application to archaeology. We begin by laying out the basic arguments of NCT, including a historical overview, focusing on how it affects understanding of human behavior and evolution. We then consider how NCT can be used to inform empirical research and how it might profitably be applied in archaeology, using as a case study the origins of agriculture. We suggest that the unrivaled potency of human niche construction, compared with that of other species, means that archaeologists need not be mere consumers of biological insights but can become important contributors to evolutionary theory. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Agriculture; Archaeology; Human evolution; Niche construction; Plant domestication",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049249344

We argue that colonisers focused mainly on coastal ecotones while crossing Wallacea, but spread more widely across favourable habitats after landing on Sahul. Movement was archaeologically instantaneous, driven primarily by serial depletion of high-ranked prey. Human populations subsequently remained far smaller than sometimes imagined, probably because of difficult climatic and environmental conditions.

We present the first test of this with data on contemporary Martu Aboriginal burning and hunting strategies in the arid spinifex savanna of the Western Desert during the cool-dry season (May-August). Our results show a strong positive effect of mosaic burning on the efficiency of hunting burrowed prey (primarily conducted by women), but not larger mobile prey (primarily conducted by men). We suggest that regular anthropogenic disturbance through burning in Australia's Western Desert may be important for sustaining biodiversity and habitat mosaics, but these effects may be maintained primarily by women's hunting of burrowed game.

Determining the tropics' response over time to changes in climate forcing mechanisms, such as summer insolation, and the effects of relative sea level on exposed continental shelves during the Last Glacial period, is an ongoing process of re-evaluation. We present a synthesis of climate proxy data from tropical Australasia spanning the last 30,000 years that incorporates deep sea core, coral, speleothem, pollen, charcoal and terrestrial sedimentary records.Today, seasonal variability is governed largely by the annual migration of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), influencing this region most strongly during the austral summer. However, the position of the ITCZ has varied through time. Towards the end of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, conditions were far wetter throughout the region, becoming drier first in the south. Universally cooler land and sea-surface temperature (SST) were characteristic of the Last Glacial Maximum, with drier conditions than previously, although episodic wet periods are noted in the fluvial records of northern Australia. The deglacial period saw warming first in the Coral Sea and then the Indonesian seas, with a pause in this trend around the time of the Antarctic Cold Reversal (c. 14.5ka), coincident with the flooding of the Sunda Shelf. Wetter conditions occurred first in Indonesia around 17ka and northern Australia after 14ka. The early Holocene saw a peak in marine SST to the northwest and northeast of Australia. Modern vegetation was first established on Indonesia, then progressively south and eastward to NE Australia. Flores and the Atherton Tablelands show a dry period around 11.6ka, steadily becoming wetter through the early Holocene. The mid-late Holocene was punctuated by millennial-scale variability, associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation; this is evident in the marine, coral, speleothem and pollen records of the region. © 2012.","Australasia; Australian monsoon; Indo-Pacific Warm Pool; INTIMATE; ITCZ; LGM; Tropics","Australasia; Australian monsoon; INTIMATE; ITCZ; LGM; Warm pools; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Charcoal; Glacial geology; Isotopes; Sea level; Tropics; atmospheric forcing; deglaciation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; heat balance; intertropical convergence zone; Last Glacial Maximum; moisture content; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; pollen; sea surface temperature; sediment analysis; speleothem; tropical environment; Australasia; Anthozoa",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880604299

The results extend the late Pleistocene expansion of pyrophytic, sclerophyll forests which occurred in the upland rain forests to a humid, megathermic coastal lowlands region. Unlike the early Holocene re-expansion of rain forests which occurred generally on the uplands, the sclerophyll forest in the lowland study area were present until at least 1400 yr BP. Changes in coastal geomorphology and coastline positions during the late Quaternary were examined in the study area by superimposing sea levels derived from published curves on sea-bed contours. The results indicate that a very rapid decrease in the extent of the coastal plain occurred during the late Pleistocene. Between 12,000 and 9000 yr BP, 26 km of the coastal plain was submerged and this would have inevitably resulted in concentrations of Aboriginal populations in the area of the present coastline. It is suggested that burning activities by Aborigines in the coastal lowlands were sufficient to reestablish sclerophyll forests during the latter part of the Holocene from approximately 4000 yr BP following a warmer and wetter period which would have been conducive to rain forest-re-expansion. Although the evidence suggests that the most recent rain forest recolonization occurred in the study area more than 1000 years ago, the process is still continuing elsewhere in the wet tropical lowlands in North Queensland. The process of eucalypt forest replacement by rain forest may have accelerated since the arrival of Europeans and the concomitant decrease in Aboriginal management.","Aborigines; Charcoal; dynamics; Holocene; rain forest; sea-level","charcoal; Holocene; rainforest; sclerophyll forest; Australia, Queensland, Daintree; Eucalyptus; Myrtaceae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030302212

Rainforest occupation before 2000 cal year BP was at generally very low levels, after which time settlement of this environment became intensive and probably permanent. Exploitation of toxic varieties of nuts began about 2500 cal year BP, peaking after 1500 cal year BP. This economic development appears crucial to successful human adaptation to rainforests in the area and was pivotal in facilitating the long-term permanent human settlement of the wet tropics. The role of fire, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity and shifting vegetation regimes were important catalysts in providing opportunities for permanent Australian rainforest Aboriginal occupation. The results have implications for global understandings of rainforest occupation by modern people.

However, some uncertainties in interpretation have resulted from concerns about the records chronology and continuity. Here we present, for the first time, the complete palynological data from detailed analysis of the top 67 m of sediment and examine it in relation to the marine isotope sequence from the core. It is proposed that the record is relatively continuous through the last 250,000 years although the latter part of oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 5, as well OIS 4 may be missing. Despite the variation on orbital scales, most palynological changes are not in phase with those from the marine isotope record suggesting a lack of direct Milankovitch forcing on vegetation. This lack of correspondence combined with major trends towards more open and sclerophyllous vegetation in association with increased burning supports a previous proposal that major control is being exercised by El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability whose influence may have been initiated by changes in oceanic circulation in the region within the mid Pleistocene. The lack of impact on the distribution of complex rainforest suggests that increased climate variability did not involve an overall decrease in total precipitation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In part, this reflects a problem within evolutionary biology: neo-Darwinism fails to recognize a fundamental cause of evolutionary change, niche construction, by which organisms modify environmental states, and consequently selection pressures, thereby acting as co-directors of their own, and other species, evolution. Social scientists are rarely content to describe human behaviour as fully determined by naturally-selected genes, and view humans as active, constructive agents rather than passive recipients of selection. To be aligned with this viewpoint, evolutionary biology must explicitly recognize the changes that humans bring about in their world to be drivers of evolutionary events. Learning and culture have played important evolutionary roles, by shaping the pattern and strength of selection acting on our ancestors. The incorporation of niche construction as both a cause and a product of evolution enhances the explanatory power of evolutionary theory and provides what ultimately will prove to be a more satisfactory evolutionary framework for understanding human behaviour.

Swamp forest is recorded for the first time within the region from pollen and plant macroremains, and this existed from the time of arrival of rainforest, probably about 8500 years B.P. until between 6000 and 4500 B.P. Firing by Aborigines in addition to climate change is considered to have been an important factor in swamp forest destruction and in the promotion of subsequent changes in swamp vegetation.

Meanwhile, archaeologists have traditionally held that Homo sapiens only intensively colonized rainforests during the Holocene, from c. 11 thousand years ago (ka). New discoveries and re-appraisal of Pleistocene (c. 200–12 ka) archaeological sites in Africa, Southeast Asia, Melanesia, and Sri Lanka, have, however, indicated the possibility for human occupation of rainforests from c. 45 ka and, more controversially, c. 200 ka. We critically review the archaeological evidence for Pleistocene human rainforest occupation from several regions. We argue that clear evidence exists for human adaptation to rainforest ecologies from c. 45 ka, with tantalizing hints of even earlier colonization. More research, however, is needed in order to understand the dynamism and diversity of palaeoecologies commonly classified as ‘rainforest’, as well as the regional extent, nature, and longevity of early human rainforest habitations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","adaptability; ecology; Homo sapiens; Pleistocene; Tropical forest","adaptation; archaeology; Holocene; hominid; human settlement; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; rainforest; subsistence; tropical forest; Africa; Melanesia; Southeast Asia; Sri Lanka; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945497040

It is these domesticates, and the agricultural economies based on them, that have formed the lever with which humans have substantially modified the earth’s terrestrial ecosystems over the past ten millennia. General explanations for this transition from hunting and gathering to food production economies formulated over the past 40 years have been based on standard evolutionary theory (SET) and employ the assumption of unidirectional adaptation—that environments change and species adapt. Here I compare these proposed SET—based externalist explanations for domestication with a recently formulated alternative developed from niche construction theory (NCT). Archaeological and paleoenvironmental records from two independent centers of domestication in the Americas—eastern North America and the Neotropics of northern South America, are found to support the NCT-based explanatory approach but not the SET explanations, underscoring the limitations of externalist SET approaches and the need for broader conceptualization of the processes that direct evolutionary change in order to gain a better general understanding of initial domestication as well as other major evolutionary transitions. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).","Domestication; Neo-Darwinism; Niche construction theory; Origins of agriculture; Standard evolutionary theory","agricultural economics; archaeological evidence; domestication; emergence; evolutionary theory; food production; hunting; Neotropical Region; niche; paleoenvironment; terrestrial ecosystem; North America; Animalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962446582

The identification of starch to species or genera has become increasingly important in studies exploring plant use in ancient societies and also in the verification of plant origin for some plant-based medicines. However, identification of starch can be problematic, because of the considerable variability in the morphology of starch grains. As a result there has always been an element of subjective judgement when it comes to identifying a sample of grains. Here we present a novel system for identifying the plant species origin of unknown starch grains using image analysis of light micrographs. After manually obtaining a mask of the two-dimensional maximum-projection-area grain shape, features for each starch grain were determined automatically including the size metrics, circularity and Fourier transform signature. The starch grain features analysed were used to create classifiers for the grains. The relative performance of the different classifiers was evaluated, based on different combinations of the predictor variables (e.g. area, perimeter etc.), and the optimal classifier determined. The method was applied to a database of 1032 grains representing 8 geographically co-located known economic plant species. A classification tree using shape metrics and the Fourier signature produced the best separations. The morphological features were sufficient to obtain a high level of accuracy in attributing individual starch grains to plant species. The method enables the creation of effective classifiers to undertake a quantitative evaluation of starch grain morphologies, thereby reducing the need for subjective qualitative determinations. The system provides a robust framework in which plant microfossils of unknown species origin can be compared with reference grains for effecting identifications. The method is potentially useful not just for starch, but other microfossils of morphometric interest. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Geometric analysis; Identification; Morphometric analysis; Starch grains","geometry; image analysis; microfossil; morphology; morphometry; plant; starch; taxonomy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991383823

International research suggests that people only permanently occupied rainforests in the last 5000 years with access to agriculture. The fact that Australian rainforest Aborigines were hunter-gatherers using specialised processing technology to exploit toxic plant foods and living at high population densities suggests a more complex situation. These groups differed significantly from their neighbours in the semi-arid and arid zones who have until recently, provided ethno-archaeological models for explaining past Aboriginal behaviour and the bases for regional archaeology. On the other hand almost nothing is known archaeologically about the adjacent rainforest groups because little work has been undertaken to investigate the temporal and spatial nature of these societies and the affect of changing rainforest ecology over the past 35,000 years. This research begins this process.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447093763

Experimental processing and chemical analyses were undertaken of nuts from yellow walnut (Beilschmiedia bancroftii), black walnut (Endiandra palmerstonii), black pine nut (Sundacarpus amara) and black bean (Castanospermum australe). Their energy values and potential dietary benefits were analysed through replication experiments that followed traditional Aboriginal processing techniques. Results indicate these species were all high energy-high return food sources. We propose that, despite the relatively intense preparation required, they would have provided an important and reliable source of starchy food within a varied rainforest diet. Findings support the proposal that processed toxic and noxious rainforest nuts may have played a significant role in the late Holocene permanent settlement of the rainforest region and in the development of a unique Aboriginal rainforest culture. © 2014 Australian Archaeological Association Inc.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937399194
