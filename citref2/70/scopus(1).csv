As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus. We also speculate on future directions in morphometric analysis. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Generalized Procrustes analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Shape analysis","geometry; morphometry; zoology; Procrustes",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321708

It is unique as a multivariate method in its choice of emphasis for analysis, that being the covariance between brain images and exogenous blocks representing either the experiment design or some behavioral measure. What emerges are spatial patterns of brain activity that represent the optimal association between the images and either of the blocks. This process differs substantially from other multivariate methods in that rather than attempting to predict the individual values of the image pixels, PLS attempts to explain the relation between image pixels and task or behavior. Data from a face encoding and recognition PET rCBF study are used to illustrate two types of PLS analysis: an activation analysis of task with images and a brain-behavior analysis. The commonalities across the two analyses are suggestive of a general face memory network differentially engaged during encoding and recognition. PLS thus serves as an important extension by extracting new information from imaging data that is not accessible through other currently used univariate and multivariate image analysis tools.",,"brain blood flow; brain function; image analysis; imaging; mathematical analysis; positron emission tomography; priority journal; review",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029941179

The consequences of innovation appear far more successful in larger populations than in smaller ones. In conclusion, it is suggested that the model has major implications for the origins of modern human culture in the last 50,000 years, which may be seen not as the result of genetic mutations leading to improved cognitive capacities of individuals, but as a population consequence of the demographic growth and increased contact range which are evident at this time.

Late Glacial records from S Brazilian highlands document the predominance of grassland (campos) where today Araucaria forests occur. Records from SE Brazil show that during pre- and full-glacial times modern tropical semideciduous forest and cerrado (savanna to dry forest) were mostly replaced by grassland and some subtropical gallery forest. Modern montane Araucaria forests and cloud forests in SE Brazil were mostly replaced by grassland during pre- and full-glacial times. There is evidence that the modern tropical Atlantic rainforest in S Brazil was significantly reduced and replaced by cold-adapted forest taxa or grassland during glacial, especially during full-glacial times. The synthesis indicates that grasslands dominated the S and SE Brazilian landscape during the Late Pleistocene where today different forest ecosystems exist. Grassland extended over 750 km from S to SE Brazil from latitudes of about 28°/27° S to at least 20° S. These results indicate that climates in the region were markedly drier and 5-7°C cooler during glacial times. Antarctic cold fronts must have been much stronger and more frequent than today. Studies from S Brazil show that huge areas of Late Pleistocene campos vegetation were still found on the S Brazilian highlands during early and mid Holocene times, reflecting dry climatic conditions with an annual dry period of probably 3 months. Modern wet climatic conditions with no or only short dry periods were not established until the Late Holocene period when Araucaria forests replaced large areas of grassland vegetation after about 3000 14C yr B.P. and especially after 1500/1000 14C yr B.P. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

There is great variability of behavioral deficits within these groups. We sought to combine neuroanatomical measures with neurocognitive and neuromotor measures in criteria of greater sensitivity over the variety of consequences of alcohol exposure. To this end, midline curves of the corpus callosum were carefully digitized in three dimensions from T1-weighted MR scans of 15 adult males diagnosed with FAS, 15 with FAE, and 15 who were unexposed and clinically normal. From 5 h of neuropsychological testing we extracted 260 scores and ratings pertaining to attention, memory, executive function, fine and gross motor performance, and intelligence. Callosal midline shape was analyzed by new morphometric methods, and the relation of shape to behavior by partial least squares. The FAS and FAE subgroups have strikingly more variability of callosal shape than our normal subjects. With the excess shape variation are associated two different profiles of behavioral deficit unrelated to full-scale IQ or to the FAS/FAE distinction within the exposed subgroup. A relatively thick callosum is associated with a pattern of deficit in executive function; one that is relatively thin, with a deficit in motor function. The two combine in a very promising bipolar discrimination of the exposed from the unexposed in this sample.

The discipline has well established and tested methods to track change through time and to evaluate the function of artifacts that depend upon measures of variation in the archaeological record. Although a critical concept, the means by which variation in material culture is generated is not well understood. This paper explores one source of variation, copying errors, and systematically examines how cultural transmission processes act to amplify, reduce, or maintain such variation. Using simple models, we generate expected distributions for the amount of variation that occurs through time under varying circumstances. This variation is caused by small errors that are transmitted from one person to another in the propagation and replication of cultural traits. These baseline values provide useful null models for explaining variation in prehistoric assemblages of artifacts.

Computerized geometric morphometric methods for quantitative shape analysis measure, test and visualize differences in form in a highly effective, reproducible, accurate and statistically powerful way. Plant leaves are commonly used in taxonomic analyses and are particularly suitable to landmark based geometric morphometrics. However, botanists do not yet seem to have taken advantage of this set of methods in their studies as much as zoologists have done. Using free software and an example dataset from two geographical populations of sessile oak leaves, we describe in detailed but simple terms how to: a) compute size and shape variables using Procrustes methods; b) test measurement error and the main levels of variation (population and trees) using a hierachical design; c) estimate the accuracy of group discrimination; d) repeat this estimate after controlling for the effect of size differences on shape (i.e., allometry). Measurement error was completely negligible; individual variation in leaf morphology was large and differences between trees were generally bigger than within trees; differences between the two geographic populations were small in both size and shape; despite a weak allometric trend, controlling for the effect of size on shape slighly increased discrimination accuracy. Procrustes based methods for the analysis of landmarks were highly efficient in measuring the hierarchical structure of differences in leaves and in revealing very small-scale variation. In taxonomy and many other fields of botany and biology, the application of geometric morphometrics contributes to increase scientific rigour in the description of important aspects of the phenotypic dimension of biodiversity. Easy to follow but detailed step by step example studies can promote a more extensive use of these numerical methods, as they provide an introduction to the discipline which, for many biologists, is less intimidating than the often inaccessible specialistic literature. © 2011 Viscosi, Cardini.",,"accuracy; allometry; article; computer program; controlled study; discriminant analysis; geographical variation (species); geometric morphometrics; leaf morphology; measurement error; morphometrics; multivariate analysis of covariance; nonhuman; oak; permutation test; plant taxonomy; Quercus petraea; statistical analysis; analysis of variance; classification; geography; histology; Italy; methodology; oak; organ size; plant leaf; population dynamics; regression analysis; Quercus petraea; Analysis of Variance; Classification; Discriminant Analysis; Geography; Italy; Organ Size; Plant Leaves; Population Dynamics; Quercus; Regression Analysis",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053446079

This involves a consideration of the processes affecting cultural transmission. Many of these are strongly affected by the history of the biological populations in which cultural transmission occurs. It can be shown that prehistoric populations fluctuated much more than used to be thought and that these fluctuations can be hard to detect archaeologically. They can often be associated with cultural changes, and, in fact, the size of populations affects the nature of cultural processes in a variety of ways.

The engineering of four weapon systems, the thrusting spear, throwing spear, spearthrower, and bow, are examined to identify those point variables that enhance the success of the system. These variables are then measured on a 9000-year sequence of projectile points from northwestern Wyoming to examine time/space patterns.

But there is debate as to when cultural and cognitive characteristics typical of modern humans first appeared, and the role that these had in the expansion of modern humans out of Africa. Scientists rely on symbolically specific proxies, such as artistic expression, to document the origins of complex cognition. Advanced technologies with elaborate chains of production are also proxies, as these often demand high-fidelity transmission and thus language. Some argue that advanced technologies in Africa appear and disappear and thus do not indicate complex cognition exclusive to early modern humans in Africa. The origins of composite tools and advanced projectile weapons figure prominently in modern human evolution research, and the latter have been argued to have been in the exclusive possession of modern humans. Here we describe a previously unrecognized advanced stone tool technology from Pinnacle Point Site 5-6 on the south coast of South Africa, originating approximately 71,000 years ago. This technology is dominated by the production of small bladelets (microliths) primarily from heat-treated stone. There is agreement that microlithic technology was used to create composite tool components as part of advanced projectile weapons. Microliths were common worldwide by the mid-Holocene epoch, but have a patchy pattern of first appearance that is rarely earlier than 40,000 years ago, and were thought to appear briefly between 65,000 and 60,000 years ago in South Africa and then disappear. Our research extends this record to ∼71,000 years, shows that microlithic technology originated early in South Africa, evolved over a vast time span (∼11,000 years), and was typically coupled to complex heat treatment that persisted for nearly 100,000 years. Advanced technologies in Africa were early and enduring; a small sample of excavated sites in Africa is the best explanation for any perceived 'flickering' pattern. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Formal CT models were defined by anthropologists 30 years ago and have been a subject of active research in the social sciences in the ensuing years. Although increasing in popularity in recent years, CT has not seen extensive use in archaeological research, despite the quantitative rigor of many CT models and the ability to create testable hypotheses. Part of the reason for the slow adoption, we argue, has been the continuing focus on change in central tendency and mode in archaeology, instead of change in dispersion or variance. Yet archaeological research provides an excellent data source for exploring processes of CT. We review CT research in the anthropological sciences and outline the benefits and drawbacks of this theoretical framework for the study of material culture. We argue that CT can shed much light on our understandings of why material technology changes over time, including explanations of differential rates of change among different technologies. We further argue that transmission processes are greatly affected by the content, context, and mode of transmission and fundamentally structure variation in material culture. Including ideas from CT can provide greater context for explaining and understanding changes in the variation of artifacts over time. Finally, we outline what we feel should be the goals of CT research in archaeology in the coming years. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","Artifact variation; Cultural transmission; Evolutionary archaeology","anthropology; archaeological evidence; artifact; cultural change; historical geography; material culture",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547863144

A detailed facies analysis was performed in several exposures of the Botucatu Formation in the Rio Grande do Sul State (southernmost Brazil). Two basic morphological types of eolian dunes were identified: (1) simple, locally compound crescentic dunes; (2) complex linear dunes. Superimposed dunes migrating obliquely to the lee slope of the main bedforms characterize the crescentic draas. Superimposed crescentic dunes migrating parallel to the draa brink compose the linear draas. The linear draas experienced important lateral migration. Both types of composed dunes are morphodynamically interpreted as oblique dunes. The eolian dunes succession of the Botucatu Formation may be defined as a dry eolian system. As super surfaces are absent within the eolian strata, the Botucatu Formation represents a single eolian accumulation. The end of the eolian sedimentation and the development of a super bounding surface were the result of the rapid extrusion of the Serra Geral basaltic lava floods, which preserved the bedforms morphology. This fact, associated with the flexural subsidence caused by the thick lava floods, allowed the preservation of the entire eolian accumulation into the geological record.

Related to this problem is the absence of a robust statistical technique for comparing variation between different kinds of assemblages. This paper addresses these issues. The Weber fraction for line-length estimation describes the minimum difference that humans can perceive through unaided visual inspection. This value is used to derive a constant for the coefficient of variation (CV = 1.7 percent) that represents the highest degree of standardization attainable through manual human production of artifacts. Random data are used to define a second constant for the coefficient of variation that represents variation expected when production is random (CV = 57.7 percent). These two constants can be used to assess the degree of standardization in artifact assemblages regardless of kind. Our analysis further demonstrates that CV is an excellent measure of standardization and provides a robust statistical technique for comparing standardization in samples of artifacts.

When possible, one makes repeated measurements on a set of individuals to calculate the relative variability of the test with the understanding that a reliable clinical test should give similar results when repeated on the same patient. There are times, however, when repeated measurements on the same patient are not possible. Under these circumstances, to combine results from different clinical trials or test sites, it is necessary to compare the coefficients of variation of several clinical trials. Using the work of Miller, we develop a general statistic for testing the hypothesis that the coefficients of variation are the same for k populations, with unequal sample sizes. This statistic is invariant under the choice of the order of the populations, and is asymptotically χ2. We provide an example using data from Yang and HayGlass.

Additionally, a set of experimentally produced bifacial tools are incorporated into the analyses to isolate the behavioral pattern underpinning identified variation in the archaeological assemblage. The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture.

Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes). Lastly, the absence of resharpening effects raises questions about the validity of the reduction thesis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

While several attributes usually help define a "" type,"" shape is invariably the most important. Here I report on a study that uses landmark-based geometric morphometrics to better define three Paleoindian point types from Florida: Suwannees, Simpsons, and Transitional Side Notched. Bilaterally symmetric specimens were created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating the types. The results show that the base configurations were best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife allocation tests.

The Aterian is defined by the presence of 'tanged' or 'stemmed' tools, which have been widely assumed to be among the earliest projectile weapon tips. The present study systematically investigates morphological variation in a large sample of Aterian tools to test the hypothesis that these tools were hafted and/or used as projectile weapons. Methodology/Principal Findings: Both classical morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis of tool outlines are used to show that the shape variation in the sample exhibits size-dependent patterns consistent with a reduction of the tools from the tip down, with the tang remaining intact. Additionally, the process of reduction led to increasing side-to-side asymmetries as the tools got smaller. Finally, a comparison of shape-change trajectories between Aterian tools and Late Paleolithic arrowheads from the North German site of Stellmoor reveal significant differences in terms of the amount and location of the variation. Conclusions/Significance: The patterns of size-dependent shape variation strongly support the functional hypothesis of Aterian tools as hafted knives or scrapers with alternating active edges, rather than as weapon tips. Nevertheless, the same morphological patterns are interpreted as one of the earliest evidences for a hafting modification, and for the successful combination of different raw materials (haft and stone tip) into one implement, in itself an important achievement in the evolution of hominin technologies. © 2011 Radu Iovita.",,"article; elliptical Fourier analysis; fossil hominin; Fourier analysis; materials; morphometrics; Paleolithic; projectile weapon; Stone Age; tool use; weapon; weight, mass and size; archeology; devices; human; Archaeology; Equipment and Supplies; Fourier Analysis; Humans",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84455192786

Cultural traits are analogous to genes in that organisms replicate them, but they are also replicators in their own right. No one has ever seen a unit of transmission, either behavioural or genetic, although we can observe the effects of transmission.

By about 11,000 B.P., however, two lithic traditions were widespread. The Uruguai tradition, characterized by bifacial stemmed projectile points, was associated with open vegetation in the south; the Itaparica tradition, emphasizing well-formed unifacial artifacts, had dispersed over the eastern tropical parklands. An enormous amount and variety of rock paintings and/or engravings are associated with the latter. Around 7000 B.P., two new traditions emerged to exploit new habitats. The Humaitá tradition, characterized by large bifacial tools and an absence of stone projectile points, expanded over the broad-leaved forests in the south, leaving the open landscapes dominated by the projectile point-using Umbu tradition. The sambaqui (shell midden) tradition, also emphasizing large bifaces, developed along rugged portions of the southern coast. By 4000 B.P., groups along the coast of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo were using domesticated or semidomesticated plants, perhaps sweet manioc. Maize was being grown in Minas Gerais by about 3500 B.P. Carbon-14 dates from numerous sites indicate, however, that the hunter-gatherer way of life persisted in many places long after the advent of pottery-making horticulturalists. The existence of large temporal and spatial gaps even in regions with considerable investigation makes it difficult to reconstruct the process of evolution reflected in these archaeological complexes. Correlations between cultural traditions and environmental fluctuations indicate, however, that adaptation to changing conditions was a significant challenge faced by prehistoric Brazilian populations. © 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","lithics; plant domestication; preceramic traditions of coastal Brazil; rock art; shell middens",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038921087

Several Paleolithic sites with lithic assemblages attributable to the Acheulean Industrial Complex (Mode 2) have yielded bifacial bone artifacts. Many of these bone implements are similar to classic handaxes in plan shape. The arbitrary imposition of form represented by these bone bifaces suggests the deliberate application of certain operational concepts that originate from particular Acheulean technological behaviors, namely, stone handaxe manufacture. In addition, the presence of these bone tools suggests an application of specific reductive techniques that originated in both Mode 1 (i.e., Oldowan) and Mode 2 (i.e., Acheulean) lithic technologies. How does the Acheulean model for stone biface shape compare to that observed for bone biface shape? In order to understand the degree to which Acheulean stone bifaces may have served as a model of form in flaked bone technology, an objective method for evaluating form is necessary. The dimensionless approach of geometric morphometrics was applied to the study of 2D bone and stone biface plan shape. The similarity of bone and stone bifaces from the Middle Pleistocene (∼300 kya) Acheulean site Castel di Guido, Latium, Italy was evaluated by a geometric morphometric analysis of 2D outlines. The null hypothesis that there is no difference in the 2D shape of each artifact material class was tested by principal component analysis (PCA) and MANOVA/CVA of eigenshape scores. Results of the analysis show no significant difference between the plan morphology of bone and stone bifaces. These results may indicate that Acheulean concepts of preferred 2D shape were applied in the production of some bifacial bone tools and that a great disparity in raw materials did not significantly influence 2D biface morphology. Furthermore, these results lend support to the idea that Mode 2 stone flaking techniques and tool types were directly applied to bone materials in some instances. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051798141

Indeed, from the earliest commentaries on the Victoria West, it has frequently been thought of as a 'large Levallois' variant. The hypothesis that VW cores are accurately characterised as 'large Levallois' is tested here using a comparative 3D geometric morphometric (GM) methodology. GM methods are powerful statistical tools for shape analysis that offer many advantages over traditional means of shape quantification and comparison. The use of landmarks to capture shape variation allows for the preservation of the full geometry, as well as enabling the more precise description of shape versus size. Moreover, biological studies have shown that the use of landmarks allows for a flexible approach to comparing specific aspects of overall morphology. Here, we employ GM to analyse differences in core surface morphology in a range of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, including Victoria West examples (total n = 639 artefacts). In comparison with cores from non-handaxe Mode 1, Acheulean handaxes, and Levallois cores, the Victoria West share shape affinities with both Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores. However, when compared directly with a group of large Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores from Baker's Hole (UK), the Victoria West were found to more closely resemble handaxes, while the Baker's Hole set are simply isometrically-scaled Levallois cores. These analyses show that, despite broad technological and qualitative morphological similarities with Levallois cores, Victoria West cores are morphologically more similar to Lower Palaeolithic artefact forms, such as handaxes, and are in some respects distinct from Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores. In line with other recent analyses, our results support suggestions that the Victoria West technique is an extension of longstanding Acheulean traditions for the preparation of biface blanks, but with its own distinct characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A symmetry measurement tool has been developed, which is based on evaluation of the minimal distances that the vertices of a structure have to move in order to attain the required symmetry. Using this Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) method, it is possible to evaluate quantitatively how much symmetry exists in a non-symmetrical configuration and how the nearest symmetrical shape looks.

Recent discussion has centered on issues of comparability between handaxes from eastern Asian and 'Acheulean' examples from western portions of the Old World. Here, we present a multivariate morphometric analysis in order to more fully document how Mid-Pleistocene (i.e. ~803 Kyr) handaxes from Bose Basin, China compare to examples from the west, as well as with additional (Mode 1) cores from across the Old World. Results show that handaxes from both the western Old World and Bose are significantly different from the Mode 1 cores, suggesting a gross comparability with regard to functionally-related form. Results also demonstrate overlap between the ranges of shape variation in Acheulean handaxes and those from Bose, demonstrating that neither raw material nor cognitive factors were an absolute impediment to Bose hominins in making comparable handaxe forms to their hominin kin west of the Movius Line. However, the shapes of western handaxes are different from the Bose examples to a statistically significant degree. Moreover, the handaxe assemblages from the western Old World are all more similar to each other than any individual assemblage is to the Bose handaxes. Variation in handaxe form is also comparatively high for the Bose material, consistent with suggestions that they represent an emergent, convergent instance of handaxe technology authored by Pleistocene hominins with cognitive capacities directly comparable to those of 'Acheulean' hominins. © 2012 Wang et al.",,"article; artifact; China; cognition; controlled study; cultural anthropology; geometry; handaxe; Middle Pleistocene; morphometrics; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; Stone Age; animal; archeology; cluster analysis; cognition; comparative study; history; hominid; multivariate analysis; nonparametric test; psychological aspect; tool use; Animals; Archaeology; China; Cluster Analysis; Cognition; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Multivariate Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tool Use Behavior",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859837713

Two aspects of units underpin the issue. First, ideational units must not be conflated with empirical units. Ideational units are units of measurement; empirical units are the things being measured. Ideational units can be either theoretical or descriptional. Theoretical units, as their name implies, are derived from a theoretical basis, and their utility for a specific analytical purpose must be tested. Descriptional units are not derived from theory and are not attached to an analytical purpose, although they may serve the purpose of communication. Second, theoretical units must be defined intensionally, through explicit listing of their diagnostic attributes. Most extant archaeological units have been extensionally derived from the specimens included in a unit, and often comprise descriptive as well as definitive attributes, without distinction between the two. The conflation of theoretical and empirical units remains a serious problem in archaeology.

Levallois technology remains an important focus for research in Palaeolithic archaeology, yet quantitative morphological comparisons of Levallois core morphology from different regions remain rare. Here, utilizing Levallois cores from Africa, the Near East, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent, patterns of morphological variability in the shape of the Levallois flaking surface and core outline (margin) shape were examined for patterns of variability and stability across regions using 3D geometric morphometrics. The multivariate statistical shape analyses undertaken revealed a clear pattern: that is, the greatest levels of shape variability in Levallois cores is evident in the form of their outline (planform) shape. Conversely, the geometrical relationship between the margin of the Levallois cores and their topological surface morphology was relatively uniform. This pattern of variability was evident in terms of variation both across regions and between cores from the same locality. These results indicate that the outline form of such cores was a less important variable than the geometric/topological properties of the surface morphology and, in particular, the relationship between the margin of the core and those variables. These results have implications for why it has been reported that replicating such cores in modern experiments is a particularly difficult task. The specific interrelationship between the geometric properties of the core and the core margin provide further evidence that Levallois core technology would be unlikely to emerge from the context of opportunistic migrating platform reduction strategies (such as those seen in many Mode 1 industries). If, as is widely suggested, Levallois cores were deliberate products in Pleistocene contexts, these results also hint that relatively sophisticated means of social transmission (i.e. teaching) may have been required to sustain their production over time and space. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Core variation; Geometric morphometric analysis; Levallois","archaeological evidence; archaeology; geometry; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; technological development; Africa; Europe; India",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871442389

Brown 2915, U9120ACD, Puerto Madryn, Argentina","Since the beginning of systematic archaeological studies in southern Patagonia (Argentina and Chile), projectile points have played an important role as cultural markers. A sequence of projectile point types was established according to their changes in size and shape. These stone tools, along with others cultural evidences, sensed to differentiate a series of ""cultural periods,"" which were, for decades, the frame of reference to understand the cultural evolution in southernmost Patagonia. Although later researches have questioned several of these assumptions, the classical typology of projectile points continued in use until the present day. The goal of this work is to evaluate size and shape variation in two late Holocene projectile point types, known as Fell. Bird, or Magallanes IV and V points or Patagónicas and Ona points, respectively. These two types are compared using geometric morphometries and multivariate statistical analyses. The reliability in the discrimination between types is tested at the light of reduction. The analyses have shown a major incidence of reduction on shape rather than on size, and on blade rather than on stem. However, in average, types IV and V can be distinguished in terms of size, and stem shape despite reduction. Thus, even though successive cycles of use, damage and resharpening have a great influence over size and shape of projectile points, resharpening techniques are specific enough to maintain the differences of size and shape between types, a pattern that is probably related with functional requirements.

A common archaeological approach to identifying projectile weapons is to extrapolate from optimal values of ballistically-relevant attributes as determined from ethnographic North American weapons and modern experiments. Among the most significant of these attributes is ""tip cross-sectional area"" (TCSA) because it determines a point's efficiency in penetrating an animal. The warranting argument for projecting these data onto prehistoric artefacts is that past ""research and development"" necessarily led to stone projectiles with optimal TCSA values for a given delivery system. However, our test of this warranting argument, involving analysis of 132 hafted ethnographic Australian stone projectile points and 102 hafted knives, demonstrates that Aborigines did not optimize TCSA values, thus offering a challenge to TCSA-based narratives about the first appearance of projectile weaponry. This illustrates the difficulty of inferring ancient stoneworkers' design intentions from narrowly-defined optimal values. Instead, tool designs should be considered in the context of the reduction sequences that produced them and the dynamics of transmission of those reduction sequences across generations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Australian stone tools; Biface; Macroblade; Projectile point; Tip cross-sectional area","archaeology; artifact; hominid; prehistoric; tool use; weaponry; Australia; Animalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874719994

Such models are elegant in that they facilitate formal modelling of economic considerations that potentially motivate patterns seen in prehistoric data. However, the abstract nature of such models means that they do not take full account of all the practical difficulties and material challenges involved in reproducing Levallois-style reductions in stone. In particular, such models have only examined nodule morphology in two-dimensions, and did not take account of the fact that in the case of classic (lineal) Levallois reduction, core surfaces must be re-prepared between successive stages of flake removal. Hence, the potential economic implications of these factors are currently unknown, potentially undermining the significance of models that assume specific economic conditions. Here, we undertook to examine these factors using a series of experimentally produced Levallois reduction sequences. A total of 3957 flaking events were considered in our analyses, and we used six specific measures of economy to examine Levallois reduction across successive phases. Our analyses found that key assumptions of mathematical models suggesting that Levallois core morphology was driven by economic considerations (i.e. conservation of raw material when attempting to remove flakes with long cutting edges) can be upheld under the practical challenges of replicating Levallois-style reduction in stone. In supporting the notion that Levallois reduction has advantageous economic properties, our results emphasize the importance of considering why Levallois reduction did not emerge earlier in the archaeological record, and indeed, why even during the later Pleistocene the temporal and geographic distribution of Levallois technology varies. Our results also re-emphasize the value of formally modelling lithic reduction strategies in specific economic terms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Core reduction; Economy of reduction; Experiment; Levallois; Waste","archaeological evidence; economics; experimental study; numerical model; Pleistocene",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874404354

However, articles and reports published during the late nineteenth century and first decade of the twentieth century indicate clearly that many Americanists in fact did excavate stratigraphically. What they did not do was attempt to measure the passage of time and hence culture change. The real revolution in Americanist archaeology comprised an analytical shift from studying synchronic variation to tracking changes in frequencies of artifact types or styles-a shift pioneered by A. V. Kidder, A. L. Kroeber, Nels C. Nelson, and Leslie Spier. The temporal implications of the analytical techniques they developed-frequency seriation and percentage stratigraphy-were initially confirmed by stratigraphic excavation. Within a few decades, however, most archaeologists had begun using stratigraphic excavation as a creational strategy-that is, as a strategy aimed at recovering superposed sets of artifacts that were viewed as representing occupations and distinct cultures.

Thus, exploring variability on the original designs can be informative of cultural adaptive processes on past populations. However, the complex life-cycle of a stone tool includes loops of damage due to use followed by breakage and resharpening that dramatically blur the size and shape attributes defining the original design. Here we use the Factor Model, a statistical approach recently modified to be used in landmark data, to evaluate original design attributes versus changes attributed to maintenance activities on a sample of Southern Patagonia lithic stemmed points, including arrows and spears. The model enables the separation of shape aspects that tend to covary because of common factors affecting simultaneously the two fundamental modules of a classical stemmed weapon (blade/stem), from those shape features explained only by local factors affecting modules independently. Our results show that original design differences explain most of the total shape variation, and also indicate that maintenance patterns differ among point types considered as different weapon systems (arrows and spears). Whereas arrow reduction is focused on tip modifications, spears present a broader array of shape changes including the tip and the shoulders. These results demonstrate that disentangling the sophisticated interaction among original design and maintenance activities of lithic projectile points enables a proper and independent exploration of adaptation to functional demands and cognitive models of past populations.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Factor model; Geometric morphometrics; Lithic projectile points; Shape variation","factor analysis; lithic fragment; modeling; morphometry; tool use; design; geometry; numerical model; shape; statistical analysis; weapon; Patagonia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884376430

With this objective, plant succession based on palynology of a sediment profile in a swamp forest was studied on the Lower Northeast Slope of Serra Geral, Rio Grande do Sul. Samples were treated with HCl, HF, KOH and acetolysis; slides were mounted in glycerol-jelly. For each sample a minimum of 500 grains of pollen + pteridophyte and bryophyte spores was counted and other palynomorphs were counted in parallel. Tilia and Tilia Graph software were used to construct percentage and concentration diagrams, with three 14C datings. The results show a local water reservoir in the beginning of the Holocene (± 9800 yrs. BP), creating a herbaceous plant marsh by hydrosere. The initial colonization of the marsh by trees occurred about 8800 yrs. BP, with tropical species from the Coastal Plain migrating in an east-west direction. Afterwards, there was a dry phase between 7000-5000 yrs. BP. The second appearance of regional tree species began at about 5000 yrs. BP, resulting in the present forest and in the west-east migration of tropical species from interior lowlands, like this one, to re-colonize the coast after the last marine regression.","Palaeoecology; Palynology; Plant migration; Quaternary; South America","Bacteria (microorganisms); Bryophyta; bryophytes; Malvaceae; Pteridophyta; Tilia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249034377

Digital photographs of projectile points are used to digitize point outlines. Landmark coordinate data then are used to delineate 10 interlandmark characters. Multivariate analysis of projectile points ftom eight assemblages reveals that the primary difference in point shape lies between long points with narrow bases and short points with wide bases. Analysis of characters by raw material type or source discerned no significant differences. Variation in point form represented by most of the assemblages, including the Plainview and Milnesand type assemblages, overlaps to a significant degree. The Lubbock Lake FA5-17 assemblage, consisting of long points with narrow bases, appears most distinct in terms of shape and raw material selection indicating the contemporaneity of different point forms and perhaps technological traditions in the region by approximately 10,000 years ago.","Digitizing; Late Paleoindian; Multivariate analyses; Projectile points; Southern High Plains",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-35748979699

So far, however, the impact of resharpening on the distinctiveness of the blades of Paleoindian projectile points has not been investigated quantitatively. With this in mind, we used geometric morphometric techniques to compare the blades of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points from the Southern Plains of North America. We evaluated two hypotheses. The first was that blade shape distinguishes the three types. We found that blade shape distinguished Clovis points from both Folsom and Plainview points, but did not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The second hypothesis we tested was that resharpening eliminates blade shape differences among the types. To test this hypothesis, we used size as a proxy for -resharpening. The results of this analysis were similar to those obtained in the first analysis. Thus, our study suggests that, contrary to what is often assumed, resharpening does not automatically undermine the use of blade shape in Paleoindian projectile point typologies. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.",,,Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871436910

The knowledge about Quaternary small mammals from Rio Grande do Sul is very poor. However, among the results obtained by archeological research there is an interesting collection of small mammals exhumated from rock shelter deposits. Here we describe the marsupial fauna found in two sites: Garivaldino and Sangão. Both sites are located at the boundary between two large Neotropical subregions, Chaco and Parana. Sediments from these two sites are from the early, middle, and part of the late Holocene. Additionally, we discuss paleobiogeographic, paleoenvironmental, and paleoclimatic aspects, on the basis of the seven taxa recorded: Gracilinanus microtarsus, G. agilis, Monodelphis americana, Thylamys velutinus, Thylamys cf. T. velutinus, Philander opossum, and Didelphis sp. Paleoenvironmental aspects inferred for both sites are consistent: the emergence of typical elements of the current Parana biogeographic subregion was probably established by the end of the early Holocene or the beginning of the middle Holocene. Conclusions are also coherent with the results previously obtained from palynological sequences in these same localities.

Both sites have radiocarbon ages from 9,400 to 3,730 14C BP, revealing a continuous occupation of this area by hunter-gatherer populations related to Umbu Tradition. Palynological studies conducted in areas near the archaeological sites demonstrated an increase in humidity and in arboreal taxa starting at 5,400 14C BP, providing evidence of a mosaic of grasslands and forests. These findings are corroborated by the analysis of small-sized mammals related to non-human predation associated to these archaeological sites, which present contemporary taxa typical of forests and open areas. They also demonstrated that environmental changes were slow and gradual during the Holocene. Although paleoenvironmental data suggest that the landscape of this region evolve gradually from mosaic of forest and open landscapes to diverse and densest forests, zooarchaeological analysis indicates a pattern of adaptive stability that persists throughout the Holocene, characterized by generalist strategies of subsistence focused mainly in forest resources. Therefore, the favorable weather conditions and the presence of forest environments restricted to river valleys and mountain slopes until Mid-Holocene, played a central role for the initial human settlement of this area, related mainly with riverine routes. © 2012","Holocene; Hunter-Gatherer Archeology; Paleoenvironmental Studies; Palynology; Small Mammals; Southern Brazil","Mammalia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867425223

Exploratory Data Analysis [Tukey] was conducted on measurements from 159 conical fired pots excavated at al-Hiba in Iraq. Although frequency distributions of single parameters did not show clear and consistent categories, certain correlated parameters showed a clear bimodal frequency distribution into two basic shapes which matched the traditional archaeological subdivision into “cups” and “bowls.” Stylistic subdivisions perceived by undergraduate students (91, from Brooklyn College and New York University), when asked to sort profile drawings of pots (73) into perceived divisions and then group divisions into styles, agreed with the bimodal objective division. Exploratory Data Analysis can identify objective stylistic grouping of archaeological artifacts. Other findings of the authors during the conduct of this research include: (1) shape, independent of size, divides these pots into cups or bowls; (2) uniformity of surface and core colors indicates no basic differences in clays, kilns, or firing temperature and durations for nearly 1,000 years; (3) there is little inter-observer consistency in the division of the two major categories of perceived styles, but gender clearly affects the number of observed subdivisions. The study concludes with a look at statistical analyses of style in other objects and works of art and briefly explores some of the benefits that might accrue from the continued study of visual perception and art. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895756926
