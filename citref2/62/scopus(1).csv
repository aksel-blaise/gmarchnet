Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

We assessed the effects of diet, habitat, elevation, temperature, precipitation, body size, and mtDNA genetic divergence on shape variation in skulls, mandibles, and molars, structures that differ in their genetic and functional control. We asked whether these structures have adapted to environment to the same extent and whether they retain the same amount of phylogenetic signal. We studied these traits in intra- and interspecific populations of Eurasian marmots whose last common ancestor lived 2-5 million years ago. Path Analysis revealed that body size explained 10% of variation in skulls, 7% in mandibles, and 15% in molars. Local vegetation explained 7% of variation in skulls, 11% in mandibles, and 12% in molars. Dietary category explained 25% of variation in skulls, 11% in mandibles, and 9% in molars. Cyt b mtDNA divergence (phylogeny) explained 15% of variation in skulls, 7% in mandibles, and 5% in molars. Despite the percentages of phylogenetic variance, maximum-likelihood trees based on molar and skull shape recovered most phylogenetic groupings correctly, but mandible shape did not. The good performance of molars and skulls was probably due to different factors. Skulls are genetically and functionally more complicated than teeth, and they had more mathematically independent components of variation (5-6-in skulls compared to 3-in molars). The high proportion of diet-related variance was not enough to mask the phylogenetic signal. Molars had fewer independent components, but they also have less ecophenotypic variation and evolve more slowly, giving each component a proportionally stronger phylogenetic signal. Molars require larger samples for each operational taxonomic unit than the other structures because the proportion of within-taxon to between-taxon variation was higher. Good phylogenetic signal in quantitative skeletal morphology is likely to be found only when the taxa have a common ancestry no older than hundreds of thousands or millions of years (1% to 10% mtDNA divergence) - under these conditions skulls and molars provide stronger signal than mandibles. © 2005 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions. Our results indicate that geometric morphometrics offers an extremely powerful alternative to more traditional biometric approaches of length and width measurements to capture the elusive morphological changes induced by the domestication process in archaeological remains. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Classification; Geometric morphometrics; Predictive discriminant analysis; Randomization; Sus scrofa; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","accuracy assessment; archaeological evidence; body size; dentition; discriminant analysis; domestication; hunter-gatherer; identification method; morphometry; Palearctic Region; paleontology; pig; prehistoric; reconstruction; Animalia; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867907430

Using molar shape geometric morphometric analysis, archaeological Sus dental series from the Sarawak caves of Niah (Aceramic, Neolithic) and Lobang Kudih (Ming period), are compared with extant ISEA wild pigs to establish their taxonomic status and to further explore the evidence for local domestication or introduction of allochthonous populations. Results on modern data-sets show that outline analysis of the third lower molar achieves highly significant inter- and intra-specific differentiation among ISEA wild pigs, with a phenotypic divergence structure displaying congruence with molecular phylogenies. Both tooth shape and mtDNA evidence strongly suggest the so-called wild pigs of New Guinea to be the descendants of pigs domesticated in mainland South East Asia and introduced by early farmers to ISEA. None of our data provide clear evidence for a Neolithic introduction of domesticated pigs, or for the local domestication of indigenous bearded pigs, since all Aceramic and Neolithic pigs from Niah cave have been identified as indigenous bearded pig (Sus barbatus). Local domestication experiments by foragers have not been ruled out, since evidence of hypoplasia as a marker of domestication processes has been observed. Introduction of allochthonous domestic pigs between the Late Neolithic and the Metal Age is suggested, since this small domestic breed from Lobang Kudih cave displays strong phenetic relationships with S. scrofa of New Guinea, recognised by molecular phylogeography as part of the 'Pacific Clade' linked both with Lapita and Polynesian dispersals. Introduction of celebensis-like species has also been suggested. Future studies should incorporate broader time-scale and geographical framework data-sets to strengthen these assumptions.

The data provide useful information for a reconstruction of the Holocene history of the species. The evidence collected so far highlights the great variability of the species and provides a baseline to be used for the interpretation of ancient material. It is shown that not only the size, but also the shape of teeth and mandibles can help in highlighting patterns of variability in wild boar from different areas. A number of geographic trends are identified in the variation of S. scrofa across its range, mainly concerning the differentiation of insular forms, and the existence of South-North and West-East clines. Other factors such as hybridisation with domestic stock, feralisation and human-induced movement of animals may also play an important role. A comparison with ancient material emphasises the existence of similarities as well as differences between modern and ancient populations. Although some of the geographic trends identified on the basis of the analysis of modern material seem to date back to early Holocene times, the morphological history of the species appears to be complex, and in more than one area fluctuations in body size seem to have occurred. © 2009 Maney Publishing.","Biometry; Bones; Teeth; Wild boar; Zooarchaeology; Zoogeography",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-73949130124

Evidence from Heybridge in Essex indicates that there were two stages of livestock development. These may reflect the import of new breeding stock into Britain. Differences between the rate of livestock development at this rural site and the nearby urban centre of Colchester indicate differing mechanisms of animal supply between the two sites. The appearance of very large cattle in Late Roman contexts at Boreham in Essex suggests that improvement of animals continued throughout the Roman occupation and was not merely an initial response to new economic and administrative demands. The biometrical evidence from these three sites is compared with evidence from elsewhere in Europe and the development of livestock during the Roman Period is shown to be complex and varied. The impetus and ideology behind the changes in animal husbandry following the Roman invasion in Britain are explored. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines the potential for a new, more resolved type of paleoclimate proxy in the form of Microtus tooth shape, using an abundant California species, Microtus californicus. Geometric morphometrics and partial least squares analyses are used to find geographic signals in the shape of the first lower molar (m1) of this species. M. californicus m1s are relatively straight in the northwest, cooler, moister portion of California and more curved in the southeast, hotter, drier portion of the state. These tooth shape changes may be a result of selection related to different vegetation ultimately controlled by climate, and therefore diet, within the species' range. The pattern in m1 shape persists when phylogeographic hypotheses are taken into account, indicating that the climate signal is significant independent of intraspecific groupings. This method adds an important new tool to the suite of proxies available to reconstruct past climates at fine spatiotemporal scales and reveals a geographic/climatic signal that correlates with morphological variation across the range of M. californicus. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"climate signal; cline; dentition; diet; fossil; morphology; morphometry; paleoclimate; phylogeography; proxy climate record; small mammal; spatiotemporal analysis; tooth; California; United States; Mammalia; Microtus; Microtus californicus; Muridae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-75349086970

We tested this model using the dental phenotype of modern and ancient common voles (Microtus arvalis), introduced onto the Orkney archipelago (Scotland) from continental Europe some 5000 years ago. First, we investigated phenotypic divergence of Orkney and continental European populations and assessed climatic influences. Second, phenotypic differentiation among Orkney populations was tested against geography, time, and neutral genetic patterns. Finally, we examined evolutionary change along a time series for the Orkney Mainland. Molar gigantism and anterior-lobe hypertrophy evolved rapidly in Orkney voles following introduction, without any transitional forms detected. Founder events and adaptation appear to explain this initial rapid evolution. Idiosyncrasy in dental features among different island populations of Orkney voles is also likely the result of local founder events following Neolithic translocation around the archipelago. However, against our initial expectations, a second marked phenotypic shift occurred between the 4th and 12th centuries AD, associated with increased pastoral farming and introduction of competitors (mice and rats) and terrestrial predators (foxes and cats). These results indicate that human agency can generate a more complex pattern of morphological evolution than might be expected in island rodents. © 2014 The Authors.","Dispersal; Evolutionary rate; Geometric morphometrics; Island evolution; Tooth shape; Zooarchaeology","adaptation; divergence; ecological modeling; geometry; morphology; morphometry; Neolithic; population structure; rodent; Europe; Mainland [Shetland]; Scotland; Shetland; United Kingdom; Microtus arvalis orcadensis; Muridae; adaptation; anatomy and histology; animal; Arvicolinae; biological model; climate; ecosystem; Europe; founder effect; genetic variability; genetics; island (geological); molar tooth; molecular evolution; phenotype; population genetics; United Kingdom; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Arvicolinae; Climate; Ecosystem; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Founder Effect; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Islands; Models, Genetic; Molar; Phenotype; Scotland",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908068182

Recent ancient DNA (aDNA) research also indicates the incorporation of European wild boar into domestic stock during the Neolithization process. In order to establish the timing of the arrival of domestic pigs into Europe, and to test hypotheses regarding the role European wild boar played in the domestication process, we combined a geometric morphometric analysis (allowing us to combine tooth size and shape) of 449 Romanian ancient teeth with aDNA analysis. Our results firstly substantiate claims that the first domestic pigs in Romania possessed the same mtDNA signatures found in Neolithic pigs in west and central Anatolia. Second, we identified a significant proportion of individuals with large molars whose tooth shape matched that of archaeological (likely) domestic pigs. These large ‘domestic shape’ specimens were present from the outset of the Romanian Neolithic (6100–5500 cal BC) through to later prehistory, suggesting a long history of admixture between introduced domestic pigs and local wild boar. Finally, we confirmed a turnover in mitochondrial lineages found in domestic pigs, possibly coincident with human migration into Anatolia and the Levant that occurred in later prehistory. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

However, hardly any information is available about this change and its causes in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula. In order to shed more light on this issue, variations of cattle size and shape through the analysis of Bos taurus remains from ten archaeological sites located in the north-east Iberia and occupied from the middle fifth century bc to the third century ad are examined in this paper. Osteometric postcranial and teeth analyses show a clear change in cattle size and shape during the Romanization period at newly founded sites. This change is documented at all the sites from the Early Roman period. Genetically, authenticated results from a short fragment of the mitochondrial d-loop were obtained from 6 cattle metacarpals out of 33 tested. They affiliate to the main European taurine haplogroup T/T3. The integration of the available data including the archaeological background suggests that the presence of these morphologically different cattle, introduced during the Romanization period, was more pronounced at sites interpreted as villas and trading posts, rather than at cities during the Early Roman period. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ancient DNA; Bos taurus; Early Roman period; Iberian Peninsula; Middle Iron Age; Osteometry",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961289581

EGB, CP56, 55 rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France","In Western Europe the transition from the Iron Age to the Roman period is the scene of a rapid economic and agro-pastoral evolution characterized in particular by a modification in the shape of the cattle. Understanding this phenomenon, its implementation mechanisms and development dynamics represents a major challenge in archaeozoology. In our study a local and regional approach of the evolution in cattle morphology is carried out first on the scale of the middle Seine valley, then of the northern Gaul. Its purpose is to observe and compare the evolution rates in domestic cattle between Middle La Tène and the fifth century AD, and with the help of a tight chronological and geographical grid, to estimate to what extent the shape of the cattle has been influenced by the indigenous cultures, the Roman economic pattern or even the environment. This osteometrical study is based on the Log Size Index method and on a measurement corpus of 12,969 bones collected on sites located on 117 communes in France (for most of them), Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The results we obtained show local specificities in terms of breeding methods and animal morphologies, observed on a very fine scale and taking place long before the Conquest. Moreover the growth patterns of the various herds happen to be different and to evolve under the impetus of the developing Roman economic pattern. This work thus points out an essential aspect of the agro-pastoral turmoil that took place in Gaul at the turning point of our era. The Roman pattern is not the cause of the morphological changes of the cattle, nor of the diversity in cattle shapes in Gaul, but it provokes a reshaping of the agricultural systems and a redefining of the breeding strategies which boost and completely change the cattle growth patterns. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Breeding strategies; Cattle; Iron Age; Local and regional diversity; Morphological evolution; Northern Gaul; Osteometry; Roman period","agriculture; bone; breeding; cattle; economic development; evolution; Iron Age; morphology; osteology; pastoralism; Roman era; Belgium; France; Netherlands; Seine Valley; Switzerland; Animalia; Bos; Bos taurus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881247300
