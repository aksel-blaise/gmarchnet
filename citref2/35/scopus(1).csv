The phylogeographies of 10 taxa, including mammals (Ursus arctos, Sorex spp., Crocidura suaveolens, Arvicola spp.), amphibians (Triturus spp.), arthropods (Chorthippus parallelus), and plants (Abies alba, Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus spp.), were analysed to elucidate general trends across Europe. Only a small degree of congruence was found amongst the phylogeographies of the 10 taxa, but the likely postglacial colonization routes exhibit some similarities. A Brooks parsimony analysis produced an unrooted area phylogram, showing that: (i) the northern regions were colonized generally from the Iberic and Balkanic refugia; and (ii) the Italian lineages were often isolated due to the presence of the Alpine barrier. The comparison of colonization routes highlighted four main suture-zones where lineages from the different refugia meet. Some of the intraspecific genetic distances among lineages indicated a prequaternary divergence that cannot be connected to any particular cold period, but are probably related mainly to the date of arrival of each taxon in the European continent. As a consequence, molecular genetics so far appears to be of limited use in dating Quaternary events.","Chloroplast DNA; Glaciation; Mitochondrial DNA; Quaternary; Refugium; Suture-zone","chloroplast DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; Arvicolinae; bear; comparative study; Europe; genetic variability; genetics; geography; grasshopper; phylogeny; salamander; shrew; tree; Animals; Arvicolinae; DNA, Chloroplast; DNA, Mitochondrial; Europe; Geography; Grasshoppers; Phylogeny; Salamandridae; Shrews; Trees; Ursidae; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032055176

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107378

Recent studies based on population-level and pedigree data have produced remarkably high estimates of mutation rate, which strongly contrast with substitution rates inferred in phylogenetic (species-level) studies. Using Bayesian analysis with a relaxed-clock model, we estimated rates for three groups of mitochondrial data: avian protein-coding genes, primate protein-coding genes, and primate d-loop sequences. In all three cases, we found a measurable transition between the high, short-term (<1-2 Myr) mutation rate and the low, long-term substitution rate. The relationship between the age of the calibration and the rate of change can be described by a vertically translated exponential decay curve, which may be used for correcting molecular date estimates. The phylogenetic substitution rates in mitochondria are approximately 0.5% per million years for avian protein-coding sequences and 1.5% per million years for primate protein-coding and d-loop sequences. Further analyses showed that purifying selection offers the most convincing explanation for the observed relationship between the estimated rate and the depth of the calibration. We rule out the possibility that it is a spurious result arising from sequence errors, and find it unlikely that the apparent decline in rates over time is caused by mutational saturation. Using a rate curve estimated from the d-loop data, several dates for last common ancestors were calculated: modern humans and Neandertals (354 ka; 222-705 ka), Neandertals (108 ka; 70-156 ka), and modern humans (76 ka; 47-110 ka). If the rate curve for a particular taxonomic group can be accurately estimated, it can be a useful tool for correcting divergence date estimates by taking the rate decay into account. Our results show that it is invalid to extrapolate molecular rates of change across different evolutionary timescales, which has important consequences for studies of populations, domestication, conservation genetics, and human evolution. © The Author 2005.

The environmental revolution at the end of the Pleistocene, a mere 10 000 years ago, triggered major shifts in the ranges of species and hence composition of communities. Present-day communities in the boreal and temperate zones assembled at this time by combining species that survived the northern environment of the Last Cold Stage with those returning from more temperate refugia. Increasing evidence suggests that the well-studied European southern and eastern refugia for thermophilous animal and plant taxa were supplemented by cryptic refugia in northern Europe during the Late Pleistocene. These northern refugia would have been in areas of sheltered topography that provided suitable stable microclimates, and could partially explain the 'nonanalogue' mammalian assemblages of the Late Pleistocene.

However, how individual species respond to climate change depends largely on their adaptations and environmental tolerances. In the Quaternary, temperate-adapted taxa are in general confined to refugia during glacials while coldadapted taxa are in refugia during interglacials. In the Northern Hemisphere, evidence appears to be mounting that in addition to traditional southern refugia for temperate species, cryptic refugia existed in the North during glacials. Equivalent cryptic southern refugia, to the south of the more conventional high-latitude polar refugia, exist in montane areas during periods of warm climate, such as the current interglacial. There is also a continental/oceanic longitudinal gradient, which should be included in a more complete consideration of the interaction between species ranges and climates. Overall, it seems clear that there is large variation in both the size of refugia and the duration during which species are confined to them. This has implications for the role of refugia in the evolution of species and their genetic diversity. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Cryptic refugia; Geographical distribution; Quaternary; Speciation","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; genetic variation; geographical distribution; glacial history; individualism; paleoclimate; Quaternary; refugium; speciation (biology); taxonomy; temperate environment; time dependent behavior",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649201798

Location: Oceanic and near-shore archipelagos, and island-like ecosystems world-wide. Methods: Body size measurements of insular vertebrates (non-volant mammals, bats, birds, snakes and turtles) were obtained from the literature, and then regression analyses were conducted to test whether body size of insular populations varies as a function of body size of the species on the mainland (the island rule) and with characteristics of the islands (i.e. island isolation and area). Results: The island rule appears to be a general phenomenon both with mammalian orders (and to some degree within families and particular subfamilies) as well as across the species groups studied, including non-volant mammals, bats, passerine birds, snakes and turtles. In addition, body size of numerous species in these classes of vertebrates varies significantly with island isolation and island area. Main conclusions: The patterns observed here - the island rule and the tendency for body size among populations of particular species to vary with characteristics of the islands - are actually distinct and scale-dependent phenomena. Patterns within archipelagos reflect the influence of island isolation and area on selective pressures (immigration filters, resource limitation, and intra- and interspecific interactions) within particular species. These patterns contribute to variation about the general trend referred to as the island rule, not the signal for that more general, large-scale pattern. The island rule itself is an emergent pattern resulting from a combination of selective forces whose importance and influence on insular populations vary in a predictable manner along a gradient from relatively small to large species. As a result, body size of insular species tends to converge on a size that is optimal, or fundamental, for a particular bau plan and ecological strategy. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Body size; Dwarfism; Evolution; Gigantism; Island area; Island biogeography; Island rule; Isolation; Vertebrates","archipelago; bat; bird; body size; evolution; island; mammal; regression analysis; snake; testing method; turtle; Aves; Mammalia; Passeriformes; Serpentes; Testudines; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745077554

Most of this change has been due to the development and adoption of methods to analyze the Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks. These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

Rates of microevolutionary change, measured between successive generations, were found to be far higher than rates of macroevolutionary change inferred from the fossil record. More recently, it has been suggested that rates of molecular evolution are also time dependent, with the estimated rate depending on the timescale of measurement. This followed surprising observations that estimates of mutation rates, obtained in studies of pedigrees and laboratory mutation-accumulation lines, exceeded long-term substitution rates by an order of magnitude or more. Although a range of studies have provided evidence for such a pattern, the hypothesis remains relatively contentious. Furthermore, there is ongoing discussion about the factors that can cause molecular rate estimates to be dependent on time. Here we present an overview of our current understanding of time-dependent rates. We provide a summary of the evidence for time-dependent rates in animals, bacteria and viruses. We review the various biological and methodological factors that can cause rates to be time dependent, including the effects of natural selection, calibration errors, model misspecification and other artefacts. We also describe the challenges in calibrating estimates of molecular rates, particularly on the intermediate timescales that are critical for an accurate characterization of time-dependent rates. This has important consequences for the use of molecular-clock methods to estimate timescales of recent evolutionary events. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","calibrations; divergence times; molecular clock; mutation rate; purifying selection; substitution rate","mitochondrial DNA; animal; bacterium; biological model; calibration; evolution; fossil; genetic selection; genetics; human; mutation rate; phylogeny; review; time; virus; Animals; Bacteria; Biological Evolution; Calibration; DNA, Mitochondrial; Fossils; Humans; Models, Genetic; Mutation Rate; Phylogeny; Selection, Genetic; Time; Viruses; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960629871

Since that time the field of geometric morphometrics has matured into a rich and cohesive discipline for the study of shape variation and covariation. The development of the field is identified with the Procrustes paradigm, a methodological approach to shape analysis arising from the intersection of the statistical shape theory and analytical procedures for obtaining shape variables from landmark data. In this review we describe the Procrustes paradigm and the current methodological toolkit of geometric morphometrics. We highlight some of the theoretical advances that have occurred over the past ten years since our prior review (Adams et al., 2004), what types of anatomical structures are amenable to these approaches, and how they extend the reach of geometric morphometrics to more specialized applications for addressing particular biological hypotheses.

However, debate has arisen about the considerable disparities between molecular and palaeontological or archaeological dates, and about the remarkably high mutation rates inferred in pedigree studies. We argue that these debates can be largely resolved by reference to the 'time dependency of molecular rates', a recent hypothesis positing that short-term mutation rates and long-term substitution rates are related by a monotonic decline from the former to the latter. Accordingly, the extrapolation of rates across different timescales will result in invalid date estimates. We examine the impact of this hypothesis with respect to various fields, including human evolution, animal domestication and conservation genetics.

The haplotypes on the Mediterranean peninsulae are distinctive from those found elsewhere. Rather than contributing to the postglacial colonization of Europe, Mediterranean populations of widespread small mammals may represent long-term isolates undergoing allopatric speciation.

The simulations test the effect of shelf-wide isostatic changes of sea level by incorporating results from two different crustal rebound models, and the effect of the ocean-tide variability by setting open boundary values either fixed to the present state or variable according to the results of a global paleotidal model. The use of the different crustal rebound models does not affect the overall changes in tidal patterns, but the timing of the changes is sensitive to the local isostatic effects that differ between the models. The incorporation of ocean-tide changes greatly augments the amplitude of tides and tidal currents in the Celtic and Malin seas before 10 ka BP, and has a large impact on the distribution of seasonally stratified conditions, magnitude of peak bed stress vectors and tidal dissipation in the shelf seas. The predictions on seasonal stratification are supported by well-dated evidence on tidal mixing front migration in the Celtic Sea. Additional experiments using the global model suggest that the variability of offshore tides has been caused mainly by changes of eustatic sea level and ice-sheet extent. In particular, a large decrease observed at 10-8 ka BP is attributed to the opening of Hudson Strait accompanied by the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

Location Islands world-wide. Methods We assembled data on the geographic characteristics (area, isolation, maximum elevation, latitude) and climate (annual averages and seasonality of temperature and precipitation) of islands, and on the ecological and morphological characteristics of focal species (number of mammalian competitors and predators, diet, body size of mainland reference populations) that were most relevant to our hypothesis (385 insular populations from 98 species of extant, non-volant mammals across 248 islands). We used regression tree analyses to examine the hypothesized contextual importance of these factors in explaining variation in the insular body size of mammals. Results The results of regression tree analyses were consistent with predictions based on hypotheses of ecological release (more pronounced changes in body size on islands lacking mammalian competitors or predators), immigrant selection (more pronounced gigantism in small species inhabiting more isolated islands), thermoregulation and endurance during periods of climatic or environmental stress (more pronounced gigantism of small mammals on islands of higher latitudes or on those with colder and more seasonal climates), and resource subsidies (larger body size for mammals that utilize aquatic prey). The results, however, were not consistent with a prediction based on resource limitation and island area; that is, the insular body size of large mammals was not positively correlated with island area. Main conclusions These results support the hypothesis that the body size evolution of insular mammals is influenced by a combination of selective forces whose relative importance and nature of influence are contextual. While there may exist a theoretical optimal body size for mammals in general, the optimum for a particular insular population varies in a predictable manner with characteristics of the islands and the species, and with interactions among species. This study did, however, produce some unanticipated results that merit further study - patterns associated with Bergmann's rule are amplified on islands, and the body size of small mammals appears to peak at intermediate and not maximum values of latitude and island isolation. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Area; Body size; Climate; Evolution; Island rule; Islands; Isolation; Latitude; Mammals; Regression trees","adaptation; Bergmann Rule; body size; data set; elephant; functional morphology; geographical region; population structure; regression analysis; rodent; seasonal variation; selection; thermoregulation; Mammalia; Mus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859811523

These can be colonized through various means and by a wide range of species, including those with low dispersal capabilities. We use morphology, modern and ancient sequences of cytochrome b (cytb) and microsatellite genotypes to examine colonization history and evolutionary change associated with occupation of the Orkney archipelago by the common vole (Microtus arvalis), a species found in continental Europe but not in Britain. Among possible colonization scenarios, our results are most consistent with human introduction at least 5100 bp (confirmed by radiocarbon dating). We used approximate Bayesian computation of population history to infer the coast of Belgium as the possible source and estimated the evolutionary timescale using a Bayesian coalescent approach. We showed substantial morphological divergence of the island populations, including a size increase presumably driven by selection and reduced microsatellite variation likely reflecting founder events and genetic drift. More surprisingly, our results suggest that a recent and widespread cytb replacement event in the continental source area purged cytb variation there, whereas the ancestral diversity is largely retained in the colonized islands as a genetic 'ark'. The replacement event in the continental M. arvalis was probably triggered by anthropogenic causes (land-use change). Our studies illustrate that small offshore islands can act as field laboratories for studying various evolutionary processes over relatively short timescales, informing about the mainland source area as well as the island. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","demographic analysis; genetic replacement; island colonization; Microtus arvalis; phylogeography","Microtus arvalis; Muridae; cytochrome b; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; animal dispersal; article; Arvicolinae; Bayes theorem; Belgium; demography; evolution; genetic replacement; genetics; histology; island (geological); island colonization; Microtus arvalis; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; phylogeography; population genetics; United Kingdom; demographic analysis; genetic replacement; island colonization; Microtus arvalis; phylogeography; Animal Distribution; Animals; Arvicolinae; Bayes Theorem; Belgium; Biological Evolution; Cytochromes b; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genetics, Population; Great Britain; Islands; Microsatellite Repeats; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885586518

Three different taphonomic pathways are recognized in the fossil assemblages. The oldest bone remains are found redeposited in glacial or glaciofluvial sediments belonging to the repeated advances and retreats of the Weichselian glaciers. The younger remains, which date to the time after the last glacial events (younger than ca. 17-16 kyr BP), are found in situ in lacustrine, fluviatile or marine sediments either in natural deposits or in man-made refuse deposits. In all, 77 terrestrial and marine mammal species have been identified and described in detail as regards first and last appearance data (FAD and LAD), number of dated remains (NDR) and the inferred time range in the Danish/south Scandinavian area. Analyses of the data show that the central European mammoth steppe fauna expanded northward into southern Scandinavia during all Weichselian interstadials. The dynamics of the fauna match the advances and retreats of the ice cap and are best explained as a combination of expansions and local extinctions of marginal populations. After the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) a dramatic increase in species richness is seen between 15 and 11 cal. kyr BP followed by a decline towards a more moderate level between 11 and 9 kyr and a steady state in the last 9000 years with a mean richness of ca. 30 species. Two opposing processes, colonizations and extinctions, regulate the diversity and this also caused large changes in species composition with faunal turnover rates of 90% to 60% during the first 4000 years and 20% to 4% during the last 6000 years. These changes are analysed in relation to the climateinduced environmental changes and increasing human impact. It is shown that the expansion of herbivore populations was controlled by the rate of 'habitat migration' -the time lag in vegetational response to the climatic improvement and furthermore that the Younger Dryas setback induced a local extinction of several species around 12.6 cal. kyr BP. The large number of species (38) forming the peak during the 15 to 11 kyr interval was a mixture of species today considered as ecologically incompatible. The assemblages are referred to as a non-analogue or disharmonious fauna and it is explained as the result of individualistic responses by the species in accordance with their individual tolerance limits during environmental changes. Man-made habitat fragmentations after the introduction of agriculture and husbandry around 6000 BP and a steady increase in encounters with and persecution by a growing human population led to extinctions. At the same time, however, new species were attracted by the new open cultural landscape and by human habitations and activities. The transformation of continental Denmark into a group of islands and peninsulas around 8 cal. kyr BP led to further habitat fragmentations and to isolated and vulnerable island populations. An impoverished fauna is documented on the island of Sjælland which experienced a local extinction of four carnivores and two ungulates during the interval 8 to 7 kyr. The marine mammals are represented by 15 whale species, four true seals, the walrus and the polar bear. The oldest remains belong to cold-adapted species which were present in northern Denmark whenever an arctic-subarctic palaeo-Kattegat-Skagerrak existed during the Weichselian. The youngest, on the other hand, include temperate- and warm-adapted species and they have been spread more widely across the country and much further south in accordance with the Mid-Late Holocene transgressions creating the Inner Danish Waters. © 2012 The Lethaia Foundation.","Denmark; Diversity; Dynamics; Hobcene; Mammalia; Weichselian",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650571993

There is considerable debate about the behaviour of molecular clock rates around the population-species transition. Nevertheless, appropriate calibration is critical to any inference regarding the absolute timing and scale of demographic changes. Here, we use a mitochondrial cyto chrome b gene genealogy, based entirely on modern sequences and calibrated from recent geophysical events, to date the post-glacial expansion of the Eurasian field vole (Micro tus agrestis), a widespread temperate mammal species. The phylogeo graphic structure reflects the subsequent expansion of populations that went through bottlenecks at the time of the Younger Dryas (ca 12 000 years BP) rather than the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca 24 000 years BP), which is usually seen as the time when present-day patterns were determined.

The geographic distributions of genetic lineages in this commensal have been linked to the Iron Age movements within the Mediterranean region and Western Europe, the extensive maritime activities of the Vikings in the 9th to 11th centuries, and the colonisation of distant landmasses and islands by the Western European nations starting in the 15th century.

In Europe, general evolutionary scenarios have been defined from genetic evidence. Recently, these scenarios have been challenged with genetic as well as fossil data. The origins of the modern distributions of most temperate plant and animal species could predate the Last Glacial Maximum. The glacial survival of such populations may have occurred in either southern (Mediterranean regions) and/or northern (Carpathians) refugia. Here, a phylogeographic analysis of a widespread European small mammal (Microtus arvalis) is conducted with a multidisciplinary approach. Genetic, fossil and ecological traits are used to assess the evolutionary history of this vole. Regardless of whether the European distribution of the five previously identified evolutionary lineages is corroborated, this combined analysis brings to light several colonization processes of M. arvalis. The species' dispersal was relatively gradual with glacial survival in small favourable habitats in Western Europe (from Germany to Spain) while in the rest of Europe, because of periglacial conditions, dispersal was less regular with bottleneck events followed by postglacial expansions. Our study demonstrates that the evolutionary history of European temperate small mammals is indeed much more complex than previously suggested. Species can experience heterogeneous evolutionary histories over their geographic range. Multidisciplinary approaches should therefore be preferentially chosen in prospective studies, the better to understand the impact of climatic change on past and present biodiversity. © 2008 Tougard et al.",,"animal tissue; article; biodiversity; climate change; ecological genetics; evolutionary developmental biology; fossil; gene sequence; genetic trait; geographic distribution; glacial period; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; phylogeography; population dispersal; sequence analysis; species habitat; species identification; vole; animal; Arvicolinae; demography; DNA sequence; Europe; fossil; gene flow; genetic variability; genetics; physiology; population migration; species differentiation; Animalia; Mammalia; Microtus arvalis; Muridae; cytochrome b; Animal Migration; Animals; Arvicolinae; Cytochromes b; Demography; Europe; Fossils; Gene Flow; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-56149117101

The inter- and intraspecific patterns of morphological differentiation have been evaluated, using a Fourier analysis of the mandible outline. The relative importance of the effect of insular isolation and latitudinal climatic gradient on the size and shape of the two species was assessed by a comparison of the populations from the large island of Honshu and the surrounding small-island populations. The size variation in A. argenteus is correlated with the climatic gradient whilst the shape variation corresponds mainly to a random differentiation of the small-island populations from a Honshu-like basic morphological pattern. A. speciosus displays increased size on small islands, and its shape variation is related to both the climatic gradient and insularity. Finally, the two species are differentiated by both the size and shape of the mandible across the Japanese archipelago, suggesting that interspecific competition between both species is reduced via niche partitioning. Our results emphasize the importance of insular isolation on shape differentiation, but a part of the morphological differentiation is also related to the latitudinal climatic gradient. Isolation on small islands could have favoured such a response to environmental factors by lowering the gene flow that prevents almost any significant differentiation within Honshu populations. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.","Apodemus; Body size; Fourier analysis; Island evolution; Japan; Mandible","body shape; body size; climate variation; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; isolated population; morphology; rodent; sympatry; Japan; Apodemus; Apodemus argenteus; Apodemus argenteus; Apodemus speciosus; Apodemus speciosus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035700963

Owing to the bedrock morphology of this highly irregular rocky coast, two main types of valleys are defined by topographic rocky highs parallel to the coastline: 1) wide and rather shallow incised valleys offshore from a topographic sill, 2) narrow and relatively deep valleys between the sill and the coast (ria-type valley). The sedimentary infilling in both types of valleys becomes highly differentiated as the transgression advances onto the coastal area. In the wide valley seaward of the topographic sill, the infilling consists mainly of offshore heterolithic facies while, in the ria-type valley, most of the infill is composed of brackish mudflat deposits and estuarine tidal muddy sands. As the transgression proceeds, the rocky highs are flooded and the whole area is finally covered by the offshore facies. Radiocarbon dating indicates that: 1) the marine ravinement surface is highly diachronous (a few thousand years cross-shore); 2) the top of the offshore facies, coarser and very shelly, represents an episode of condensed sedimentation from about 3000 to 4000 years ago, amalgamating the maximum flooding surface (MFS) and the highstand systems tract (HST). However, we observe a muddy drape, strongly bioturbated in places, in the most proximal areas, overlying the offshore facies. It is thought to represent the modern and most recent stage of sedimentary infilling. This mud cover is made of fine-grained sediments of fluvial and biological origin, and is interpreted as a prograding HST. It reflects an increased influx, partly due to human activities. Finally, the main features of incised valley sedimentary infilling in a rocky coast context with low sediment supply can be characterized by (i) the very strong control of bedrock morphology, (ii) the diachronous character of the transgression, (iii) the late position of the MFS, and (iv), the highly reduced volume of the HST.","Geomorphology; Holocene infill; Incised valley; Low sediment supply; Rocky coast; Southern Brittany; Vhr seismic; Vibrocoring","bedrock; coastal morphology; coastal zone; fine grained sediment; geological record; Holocene; incised valley; infill; marine sediment; mudflat; radiocarbon dating; sediment transport; transgression; Bretagne; France",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951626773

Here we propose that small mammals provide an analogue to help resolve this controversy. Previous studies have shown that common shrews (Sorex araneus) with particular chromosomal characteristics and water voles (Arvicola terrestris) of a specific mitochondrial (mt) DNA lineage have peripheral western/northern distributions with striking similarities to that of Celtic people. We show that mtDNA lineages of three other small mammal species (bank vole Myodes glareolus, field vole Microtus agrestis and pygmy shrew Sorex minutus) also form a 'Celtic fringe'. We argue that these small mammals most reasonably colonized Britain in a two-phase process following the last glacial maximum (LGM), with climatically driven partial replacement of the first colonists by the second colonists, leaving a peripheral geographical distribution for the first colonists. We suggest that these natural Celtic fringes provide insight into the same phenomenon in humans and support its origin in processes following the end of the LGM. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Colonization history; Microtus agrestis; Mitochondrial DNA; Myodes glareolus; Replacement; Sorex minutus","mitochondrial DNA; ancestry; chromosome; colonization; geographical distribution; last glaciation; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; replacement; small mammal; article; geographic distribution; nonhuman; phylogeography; priority journal; shrew; small mammal; United Kingdom; vole; United Kingdom; Arvicola terrestris; Clethrionomys glareolus; Mammalia; Microtus agrestis; Microtus richardsoni; Sorex araneus; Sorex hoyi; Sorex minutus; Soricidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-72749097173

Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of this ratio leads to a deeper understanding of the erosion and deposition of sediments over the shelf seas throughout this time period. Tidal and wave models are here applied to palaeo time slices of the northwest European shelf seas over the last 12,000 years. The model simulations include a series of sensitivity tests to account for the influence of interannual variability in wind conditions on the resulting bed shear stress. The results show that there has been a significant decrease over the last 12,000 years in shelf-scale mobilisation of coarse sediment. Since there was a lower magnitude of wave orbital velocity penetrating to the sea bed as a result of increasing relative sea level, this reduction in sediment mobilisation was primarily controlled by a shelf-scale decrease in wave-induced bed shear stress over the last 12,000 years. The predictions of mean and residual bed shear stress for the modelled palaeo time slices are a useful tool with which to inform site-selection and subsequent interpretation of sediment cores. In addition, the modelled reconstructions of palaeo tidal range over the shelf seas demonstrates the potential errors associated with assuming a present-day tidal range when correcting palaeo sea-level proxies from their deposited datum (e.g. palaeo mean high water spring tide) to palaeo mean sea level. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Bed shear stress; Holocene; NW European shelf seas; Palaeoceanography; Sediment distribution; Tidal model; Wave model","Bed shear stresss; European shelf; Holocenes; Palaeoceanography; Sediment distribution; Tidal models; Wave model; Computer simulation; Sea level; Sedimentology; Shear stress; Site selection; Springs (water); Strength of materials; Stress concentration; Tides; Shear flow; bottom stress; Holocene; late glacial; paleoceanography; sea level change; sediment transport; sensitivity analysis; shear stress; shelf sea; spatiotemporal analysis; tidal modeling; wave modeling; Atlantic Ocean; Northwest European Shelf",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958083717

We performed analyses on 998-bp-long haplotypes of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 143 samples collected around the Mediterranean basin, including islands and the Middle East. The analyses suggest that the Cypriot shrew belongs to the rare group of relict insular Pleistocene mammal taxa that have survived to the present day. In contrast, the Cretan, Corsican and Menorcan populations were independently introduced from the Middle East during the Holocene. The phylogeographical structure of this temperate Palaearctic species within the Middle East appears to be complex and rich in diversity, probably reflecting fragmentation of the area by numerous mountain chains.

We tested this model using the dental phenotype of modern and ancient common voles (Microtus arvalis), introduced onto the Orkney archipelago (Scotland) from continental Europe some 5000 years ago. First, we investigated phenotypic divergence of Orkney and continental European populations and assessed climatic influences. Second, phenotypic differentiation among Orkney populations was tested against geography, time, and neutral genetic patterns. Finally, we examined evolutionary change along a time series for the Orkney Mainland. Molar gigantism and anterior-lobe hypertrophy evolved rapidly in Orkney voles following introduction, without any transitional forms detected. Founder events and adaptation appear to explain this initial rapid evolution. Idiosyncrasy in dental features among different island populations of Orkney voles is also likely the result of local founder events following Neolithic translocation around the archipelago. However, against our initial expectations, a second marked phenotypic shift occurred between the 4th and 12th centuries AD, associated with increased pastoral farming and introduction of competitors (mice and rats) and terrestrial predators (foxes and cats). These results indicate that human agency can generate a more complex pattern of morphological evolution than might be expected in island rodents. © 2014 The Authors.","Dispersal; Evolutionary rate; Geometric morphometrics; Island evolution; Tooth shape; Zooarchaeology","adaptation; divergence; ecological modeling; geometry; morphology; morphometry; Neolithic; population structure; rodent; Europe; Mainland [Shetland]; Scotland; Shetland; United Kingdom; Microtus arvalis orcadensis; Muridae; adaptation; anatomy and histology; animal; Arvicolinae; biological model; climate; ecosystem; Europe; founder effect; genetic variability; genetics; island (geological); molar tooth; molecular evolution; phenotype; population genetics; United Kingdom; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Arvicolinae; Climate; Ecosystem; Europe; Evolution, Molecular; Founder Effect; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Islands; Models, Genetic; Molar; Phenotype; Scotland",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908068182

Previous studies have linked the distribution of house mouse mitochondrial (mt) DNA clades to areas formerly occupied by the Norwegian Vikings in Norway and the British Isles. Norwegian Viking activity also extended further westwards in the North Atlantic with the settlement of Iceland, short-lived colonies in Greenland and a fleeting colony in Newfoundland in 1000 AD. Here we investigate whether house mouse mtDNA sequences reflect human history in these other regions as well. Results: House mice samples from Iceland, whether from archaeological Viking Age material or from modern-day specimens, had an identical mtDNA haplotype to the clade previously linked with Norwegian Vikings. From mtDNA and microsatellite data, the modern-day Icelandic mice also share the low genetic diversity shown by their human hosts on Iceland. Viking Age mice from Greenland had an mtDNA haplotype deriving from the Icelandic haplotype, but the modern-day Greenlandic mice belong to an entirely different mtDNA clade. We found no genetic association between modern Newfoundland mice and the Icelandic/ancient Greenlandic mice (no ancient Newfoundland mice were available). The modern day Icelandic and Newfoundland mice belong to the subspecies M. m. domesticus, the Greenlandic mice to M. m. musculus. Conclusions: In the North Atlantic region, human settlement history over a thousand years is reflected remarkably by the mtDNA phylogeny of house mice. In Iceland, the mtDNA data show the arrival and continuity of the house mouse population to the present day, while in Greenland the data suggest the arrival, subsequent extinction and recolonization of house mice - in both places mirroring the history of the European human host populations. If house mice arrived in Newfoundland with the Viking settlers at all, then, like the humans, their presence was also fleeting and left no genetic trace. The continuity of mtDNA haplotype in Iceland over 1000 years illustrates that mtDNA can retain the signature of the ancestral house mouse founders. We also show that, in terms of genetic variability, house mouse populations may also track their host human populations. © 2012 Jones et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"ancestry; colonization; commensal; evolutionary biology; extinction; genetic variation; Holocene; hominid; human settlement; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeny; phylogeography; recolonization; rodent; settlement history; subspecies; zoogeography; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Greenland; Iceland; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Mus; Mus musculus; microsatellite DNA; mitochondrial DNA; animal; article; Canada; genetic variability; genetics; Greenland; history; human; Iceland; migration; mouse; phylogeny; population migration; species difference; Animal Migration; Animals; DNA, Mitochondrial; Emigration and Immigration; Genetic Variation; Greenland; History, 15th Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Iceland; Mice; Microsatellite Repeats; Newfoundland and Labrador; Phylogeny; Species Specificity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858324626

In order to assess the relative importance of these two disparate processes, insular effects were addressed in the European wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus (Linnaeus, 1758). Location: Wood mice from 33 localities on both mainland and various Atlantic and western Mediterranean islands were considered. This sampling covers only part of the latitudinal range of A. sylvaticus but included the two main genetic clades identified by previous studies. Islands encompass a range of geographical conditions (e.g. small islands fringing the continent through large and isolated ones). Methods: The insular syndrome primarily invokes variations in body size, but ecological factors such as release from competition, niche widening and food availability should also influence other characters related to diet. In the present study, the morphology of the wood mice was quantified based on two characters involved in feeding: the size and shape of the mandibles and first upper molars. The size of the mandible is also a proxy for the body size of the animal. Patterns of morphological differentiation of both features were estimated using two-dimensional outline analysis based on Fourier methods. Results: Significant differences between mainland and island populations were observed in most cases for both the mandibles and molars. However, molars and mandibles displayed divergent patterns. Mandible shape diverged mostly on islands of intermediate remoteness and competition levels, whereas molars exhibited the greatest shape differentiation on small islands, such as Port-Cros and Porquerolles. A mosaic pattern was also displayed for size. Body and mandible size increased on Ibiza, but molar size remained similar to mainland populations. Mosaic patterns were, however, not apparent in the mainland populations. Congruent latitudinal variations were evident for the size and shape of both mandibles and molars. Main conclusions: Mosaic evolution appears to characterize insular divergence. The molar seems to be more prone to change with reduced population size on small islands, whereas the mandible could be more sensitive to peculiar environmental conditions on large and remote islands. © 2007 The Authors.","Apodemus sylvaticus; Body size; Dentition; Fourier analysis; Island syndrome; Mandible shape; Morphometrics; Rodentia","body size; cladistics; dental health; latitudinal gradient; morphology; morphometry; rodent; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Apodemus sylvaticus; Mus; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846422714

We studied the effects of sympatry on size and shape of the skulls, mandibles and molars in two species of water shrew, Neomys anomalus and Neomys fodiens. We studied populations from six localities in Poland, three where the species are sympatric (Pomorze, Białowieża, and Bieszczady Mts) and three where only N. fodiens is found. We studied shape and size using geometrical landmarks. The three morphological structures that we studied are expected to respond differently to environment and competition, because they are controlled by different numbers of gene loci, have different developmental patterns and different functional roles. We found strong evidence that shape in all three structures was influenced by local environment and that both species responded to geoclimatic factors in the same way. Indirect evidence suggests that the parallel response of the two species is likely to be ecophenotypic in the case of skulls and mandibles but selective in molars. We found no evidence for character displacement in either size or shape, although significant differences were found between the two species as a whole, and within species between localities. Not only was there any evidence for displacement but also the species were actually more similar when they occurred in sympatry, probably because of the similar ecophenotypic responses to their shared environment. © 2006 The Authors.","Character displacement; Comparative morphological response; Competitive release; Geometrical morphometrics; Neomys","competition (ecology); ecomorphology; environmental factor; phenotype; rodent; sympatry; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Poland; Mammalia; Neomys; Neomys anomalus; Neomys fodiens; Sorex palustris; Soricidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749021337

Location: Mediterranean palaeo-islands. Methods: We assembled data on temporal variation in body size of palaeo-insular mammals and associated variation in ecological characteristics (colonization or extirpation of mammalian competitors and predators) for 19 species of fossil, non-volant mammals across four large (&gt; 3640 km2) islands ranging between the late Miocene and Holocene. These are the only fossil species for which fine-detailed time series are available at present. Results: Our results are consistent with predictions based on an ecological interactions hypothesis of body size evolution. Following colonization (or first appearance in the insular fossil record) small mammals (such as mice, shrews and pikas) tended to increase in body size. These trends, however, ceased or were reversed following colonization of the focal islands by mammalian predators or competitors. Main conclusions: While body size evolution is likely to be influenced by a variety of characteristics of the focal islands (e.g. climate, area, isolation and habitat diversity) and species (e.g. diet, resource requirements and dispersal abilities), temporal trends for palaeo-insular mammals indicated that the observed trends for any particular species, island and climatic regime may be strongly influenced by interactions among species. Ultimately, invasion of a competitor often leads to the extinction of the native, insular species. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biological invasions; Body size fluctuations; Competition; Extinct species; Fossil record; Island evolution; Island rule; Mammals; Mediterranean palaeo-islands; Predation","biological invasion; body size; convergent evolution; divergence; extinction; fossil record; hypothesis testing; interspecific interaction; island; mammal; predation; temporal variation; time series analysis; Mammalia; Mus; Ochotonidae; Soricidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880506578

The aim of this study was to test which of these hypotheses can best explain the increase of body size in common shrews (Sorex araneus) on islands. Location: The fieldwork for this study was carried out on the islands of the Inner Hebrides, Clyde Islands and the west coast of Scotland. Methods: This study compared body sizes of common shrews from mainland and island sites on the west coast of Scotland, based on measurements of hind foot lengths. On 10 of the 13 islands sampled, common shrews were significantly larger than on the mainland. Body size did not vary significantly among mainland populations. We used the directional contrasts method to test the relative contributions of possible factors explaining the large body size observed in the island populations. Results: We found that body size of common shrews on islands was positively related to distance from mainland, negatively related to average annual temperature, negatively related to island size, and may also be influenced by the presence or absence of pygmy shrews (Sorex minutus) on the island.

Moreover, in the same region, the abundance index of the greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) on Tomé Island increased by factors of 9 and 17, one and two years after the Norway rat eradication, respectively. The maximum variation of the abundance index for the lesser white-toothed shrew during seven years on the rat-free island of Béniguet in the same region was a factor of only 2.5. Moreover, the distribution of the lesser white-toothed shrew on Bono island, restricted before the eradication to two steep areas with few rats, increased and encompassed virtually the entire island four years after rats disappeared. These results suggest strong detrimental interactions between the introduced Norway rat and the two Crocidura shrew species on temperate oceanic islands. However, our data do not indicate the ecological mechanisms at work in these interactions. The main reason this shrew recovery was detected after rat eradication was the inclusion in the eradication protocol of the evaluation of impacts on the local biota of eliminating alien species. The rigor of the sampling procedure was also crucial to this discovery. This example demonstrates that an eradication operation can be extremely useful for both scientists and managers if it is planned as a research project. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biological invasions; Brittany; Crocidura russula; Crocidura suaveolens; Eradication; Impact; Introduced species; Island; Rattus norvegicus","biological invasion; insectivore; island; population growth; restoration ecology; rodent; Bretagne; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; France; Western Europe; World; Basidiomycota; cellular organisms; Crocidura; Crocidura russula; Crocidura suaveolens; Rattus norvegicus; Russula",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18444405875

New stratigraphic sequences were obtained and analyzed to derive 24 new Sea-level Index Points, in which 6 are basal. These new data considerably increase the knowledge we have of the RSL evolution along the coasts of Western Brittany since the last 8 kyr B.P. From this new dataset, RSL was estimated to rise continuously over the last 8 kyr with a major inflection at ca. 6 kyr cal. BP. Our results show large vertical discrepancies between the RSL records of Brittany and South-Western UK, with the latter plotting several meters below the new data. From this comparison we suggest that the two regions underwent a very different pattern and/or amplitude of subsidence during the last 8 kyr which has implications for the spatial and temporal pattern of the peripheral bulge of the European ice sheets. We compared our data against predictions from Glacio-Isostatic Adjustment models (GIA models). There are large misfits between RSL observations and the predictions of the global (ICE-5G (VM2a) - Peltier, 2004, GLAC1-b - Tarasov and Peltier, 2002; Tarasov et al., 2012, Briggs et al., 2014) and regional UK models (""BIIS"" - Bradley et al., 2009; Bradley et al., 2011; ""Kuchar""- Kuchar et al., 2012), which can't be resolved through significant changes to the deglaciation history and size of the British-Irish Ice sheet. Paleo-tidal modelling corrections indicate regional changes in the tidal ranges played a negligible role in the data-model misfits. Hence, we propose that the misfits are due to some combination of: (i) unaccounted mass-loss of far-field ice-sheets (Antarctic ice-Sheet or Laurentide Ice-Sheet), (ii) unresolved differences in the deglaciation history and size of the Fennoscandian Ice sheet or, more likely, (iii) significant lateral variations in the Earth's structure across the English Channel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Brittany; Earth structure; GIA models; Holocene; Isostasy; Relative sea-level; Tidal-range modelling","Aluminum; Forecasting; Glacial geology; Glaciers; Sea level; Stratigraphy; Tides; Brittany; Earth structures; Holocenes; Isostasy; Relative sea level; Tidal ranges; Ice; data set; deglaciation; Earth structure; glacioisostasy; Holocene; ice sheet; sea level change; spatiotemporal analysis; stratigraphy; subsidence; tidal range; Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; Atlantic Coast [Europe]; Bretagne; English Channel; Fennoscandia; Finistere; France; Ireland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946408779

We therefore investigated how hybridisation affects the shape of the mouse mandible, a well-known feature in evo-devo studies. Parental groups corresponded to two strains of the European mouse sub-species Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus. Parents and hybrids were bred in controlled conditions. The mandibles of F1 hybrids are mostly intermediate between parental phenotypes as expected for a complex multigenic character. Nevertheless, a transgressive effect as well as an increased phenotypic variance characterise the hybrids. This suggests that hybridisation between the two subspecies could lead to a higher phenotypic variance due to complex interactions among the parental genomes including non-additive genetic effects. The major direction of variance is conserved, however, among hybrids and parent groups. Hybridisation may thus play a role in the production of original transgressive phenotypes occurring following pre-existing patterns of variance. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Hybridisation; Interspecific divergence; Mandible shape; Morphometrics","breeding; evolutionary biology; genetic analysis; genome; hybridization; interspecific interaction; phenotype; rodent; species occurrence; subspecies; anatomical variation; animal experiment; article; controlled study; cross breeding; evolutionary developmental biology; gene interaction; hybridization; interspecific hybrid; mandible; mouse; mouse strain; nonhuman; parent; phenotype; subspecies; tissue structure; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Crosses, Genetic; Female; Fourier Analysis; Male; Mandible; Mice; Organ Size; Phenotype; Mus; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus musculus musculus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-68949198786

Fifty cores were retrieved from Tresseny, Porzguen, Troaon and Arun salt-marshes, which were litho- and biostratigraphically analysed in order to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental changes. A total of 26 AMS 14C age determinations were performed within the sediment successions. The Holocene evolution of salt-marsh environments can be subdivided into four stages: (i) a development of brackish to freshwater marshes (from c.6400 to 4500cal. a BP); (ii) salt-marsh formation behind gravel barriers in the bay of Brest (from 4500 to 2900 cal. a BP); (iii) salt-marsh erosion and rapid changes of infilling dynamics due to the destruction of coastal barriers by storm events (c.2900-2700cal. a BP); (iv) renewed salt-marsh deposition and small environmental changes (from 2700 cal. a BP to present). From the application of transfer functions to fossil assemblages, 14 new sea-level index points were obtained, indicating a mean relative sea-level rise of around 0.90±0.12mm a-1 since 6300 cal. a BP. © 2014 Collegium Boreas.

Consequently, islands have been key model systems in our understanding of evolutionary theory. The greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) is of interest as it has invaded French Atlantic islands within the last few thousand years and is considered to be morphologically and genetically stable in this area. In this article, we study the shape of the mandible of the greater white-toothed shrew on four islands and compare it with that of individuals from populations on the mainland to quantify the effects of insularity. The degree of insularity (i.e. island size and distance to the continent) is thought to be linked to differences in ecological characteristics of islands compared with the mainland. We used geometric morphometric analyses to quantify differences in size and shape between populations and employed a simple biomechanical model to evaluate the potential effects of shape differences on bite force. Specimens from island populations are different from continental populations in shape and mechanical potential of the mandible. Among islands, the mandible shows various shapes that are correlated with both the distance from the coast and island area. The shape differences are located on different parts of the mandible, suggesting different ecological constraints on each island. Moreover, these shapes are linked to the 'mechanical potential', which is markedly different between islands. Mechanical potential has been suggested to evolve in response to prey size and or mechanical properties. In conclusion, our results show that, in spite of the relatively recent colonization of the Atlantic Islands, the mandible of C.russula possesses a distinct shape. Moreover, the shape differs among islands and is probably linked to the consumption of different prey. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.","Bite force; Mandible; Morphometrics; Shape","biomechanics; colonization; evolutionary theory; functional change; morphology; morphometry; prey size; rodent; specimen bank; tooth; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; France; Crocidura; Crocidura russula; Russula",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866326784

The greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) is an invasive species in Ireland that was first recorded in 2007 and which, according to initial data, may be limiting the abundance/distribution of the pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus), previously Ireland's only shrew species. Because of these concerns, we undertook an intensive live-trapping survey (and used other data from live-trapping, sightings and bird of prey pellets/nest inspections collected between 2006 and 2013) to model the distribution and expansion of C. russula in Ireland and its impacts on Ireland's small mammal community. The main distribution range of C. russula was found to be approximately 7,600 km2 in 2013, with established outlier populations suggesting that the species is dispersing with human assistance within the island. The species is expanding rapidly for a small mammal, with a radial expansion rate of 5.5 km/yr overall (2008-2013), and independent estimates from live-trapping in 2012-2013 showing rates of 2.4-14.1 km/yr, 0.5-7.1 km/yr and 0-5.6 km/yr depending on the landscape features present. S. minutus is negatively associated with C. russula. S. minutus is completely absent at sites where C. russula is established and is only present at sites at the edge of and beyond the invasion range of C. russula. The speed of this invasion and the homogenous nature of the Irish landscape may mean that S. minutus has not had sufficient time to adapt to the sudden appearance of C. russula. This may mean the continued decline/disappearance of S. minutus as C. russula spreads throughout the island. © 2014 McDevitt et al.",,"adaptation; animal trapping; Apodemus sylvaticus; article; community ecology; Crocidura russula; geographical variation (species); intraspecific competition; invasive species; Ireland; landscape; live trapping; Myodes glareolus; nonhuman; population abundance; shrew; Sorex minutus; species dispersion; species distribution; species expansion; species habitat; species invasion; animal; classification; ecology; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; human; introduced species; shrew; species difference; statistics and numerical data; Animals; Ecology; Ecosystem; Humans; Introduced Species; Ireland; Shrews; Species Specificity",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903548793

The two species exclude each other on islands but can occur on very close islands within the same archipelago. C. suaveolens is significantly larger in size on islands than on the continent, while no difference was observed in C. russula. Historical changes in sea level and in Crocidura species distribution on the mainland suggest that C. suaveolens may be a native species whose insular populations were separated from mainland ones during the insularisation process, 10-5,000 ago, whereas C. russula may be a recent invader. Comparing geographical characteristics and human occupancy of islands shows that human activities seem to be responsible for the substitution of the native species by the invasive species on most islands. Such substitution, documented on Sein island between 1966 and 1995, could have occurred recently on other small inhabited islands and favoured by the intensification of anthropisation over the two past centuries.","Alein species; Biogeography; Crocidura; Exclusion; Insularity","shrew populations",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030319519

However, direct radiocarbon dating of small vertebrates remains challenging as the extraction of sufficient good quality collagen is required. The efficiency of eight collagen extraction protocols was tested on seven samples, representative of different ages and burial environments, including both macro and small vertebrate taxa. First, the samples were prescreened using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to quantify collagen content in archaeological bones, revealing that one should be discarded for 14C dating. Then, the quantity of protein extracted (yield) and collagen integrity were checked using conventional elemental analysis. The results show that one protocol was not able to accurately extract collagen from the samples. A soft HCl-based protocol seems more appropriate for the pretreatment of archaeological small mammal bones, whereas a harsher protocol might be more efficient to extract a higher amount of collagen from large mammals as well as amphibian bones. The influence of the tested protocols on carbon and nitrogen isotope values was also investigated. The results showed that isotopic variability, when existing, is related to the interindividual differences rather than the different protocols. © 2016 by the Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University of Arizona.","archaeozoology; ATR-FTIR; bone; collagen preservation; isotopic analysis; small vertebrates","archaeology; bone; collagen; extraction method; fossil record; FTIR spectroscopy; isotopic analysis; preservation; radiocarbon dating; skeletal remains; stable isotope; vertebrate; Amphibia; Mammalia; Vertebrata",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020503225

It is present on many islands around the margins of the continent and in northern Africa. The species has been the subject of previous phylogeographical studies, although these have focussed on the more southerly part of its range. A substantial number of new samples, many of them from the periphery of the species' range, contribute to an exceptional dataset comprising 981 mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. These new data provide sufficient resolution to transform our understanding of the survival of the species through the last glaciation and its subsequent re-colonization of the continent. The deepest genetic split that we found is in agreement with previous studies and runs from the Alps to central Ukraine, although we further distinguish two separate lineages in wood mice to the north and west of this line. It is likely that this part of Europe was colonized from two refugia, putatively located in the Iberian peninsula and the Dordogne or Carpathian region. The wood mouse therefore joins the growing number of species with extant populations that appear to have survived the Last Glacial Maximum in northern refugia, rather than solely in traditionally recognized refugial locations in the southern European peninsulas. Furthermore, the existence of a northern refugium for the species was predicted in a study of mitochondrial variation in a specific parasite of the wood mouse, demonstrating the potential value of data from parasites to phylogeographical studies. Lastly, the presence of related haplotypes in widely disparate locations, often on islands or separated by substantial bodies of water, demonstrates the propensity of the wood mouse for accidental human-mediated transport. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.","Cytochrome b; Demography; Human introduction; Mitochondrial DNA; Molecular clock; Phylogeography","colonization; cytochrome; demography; dispersal; introduced species; Last Glacial Maximum; last glaciation; mitochondrial DNA; molecular analysis; phylogeography; Postglacial; refugium; rodent; Alps; Europe; Ukraine; Apodemus sylvaticus; Mus; Rodentia",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987651027

The advent of accelerator mass spectrometers (AMS) has revolutionized the field of archaeology but routine AMS dating still requires 60-200 mg of bone, which far exceeds that of small vertebrates or remains which hold a patrimonial value (e.g. hominid remains or worked bone artefacts). Here, we present the first radiocarbon dates obtained from minute amounts of bone (3-60 mg) using a MIni CArbon DAting System (MICADAS). An optimized protocol allowed us to extract enough material to produce between 0.2 and 1.0 mg of carbon for graphite targets. Our approach was tested on known-age samples dating back to 40,000 BP, and served as proof of concept. The method was then applied to two archaeological sites where reliable dates were obtained from the single bones of small mammals. These results open the way for the routine dating of small or key bone samples. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026816021

Thus, the ability to gain access to resources not available to other individuals and species should be under strong selection. In the present study, we focus on the potential role of biting in a shrew (Crocidura russula) because this trait may confer two advantages: (1) a broadening of the dietary niche and (2) the provision of direct superiority in interspecific interactions. The model chosen is the greater white-toothed shrew, which is considered as invasive in northern Europe and which is also known to displace native species of shrew in this area. Moreover, its distribution appears to constrain the distributional ranges of other species of shrew in the Maghreb. We use geometric morphometrics and a simple biomechanical model to describe shape variation and to evaluate the mechanical potential of the mandible of ten species of white-toothed shrews, with a special emphasis on C. russula and Crocidura suaveolens. We find that C. russula possesses an intermediate mechanical potential linked with an intermediate level of shape variability. Our results suggest that the higher mechanical potential may explain the observed pattern of colonization of the Atlantic islands by C. russula at the expense of C.suaveolens. Finally, our results also suggest that the ability to bite hard may be under strong selection in shrews. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.","Crocidura; Feeding system; Islands; Mammals; Mechanical potential; Shape","biomechanics; colonization; life history trait; morphometry; native species; natural selection; niche breadth; rodent; shape; Atlantic islands; Maghreb; Crocidura; Crocidura russula; Crocidura suaveolens; Mammalia; Soricidae",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924540595

Allometric models are a reliable way to predict the weight of extinct species, but are scarce or even absent for some groups of micromammals. To fill the gap, we carried out regression models with extant species of soricids (N = 63) using measurements of teeth, cranium, and postcranial bones, and applied these to fossil insular species and their mainland ancestors. Almost all models are significant (P < 0.05), except for those based on the width of occipital condyles. The femur can be considered the most reliable body-mass predictor, producing estimations not far from those derived from teeth (excepting molar widths). Predictions of insular species (in grams) show that those belonging to the tribe Nectogalini [Asoriculus burgioi Masini & Sarà, 27.54; Asoriculus similis (Hensel, 1855), 23.68; Nesiotites ponsi Reumer, 1979, 14.58; Nesiotites meloussae Pons-Moyà & Moyà-Solà, 1980, 24.83; Nesiotites hidalgo Bate, 1945, 26–30] had larger masses than Crocidura sp.

Statistical comparisons with their ancestors revealed that certain species (Nesiotites sp. from Mallorca and A. similis from Sardinia) may be considered giants, but not C. zimmermanni (from Crete). Body size is closely related to life history, which is highly influenced by the selective regimes of the environment. Thus, the lower isolation distance of Crete in comparison with Sardinia and Mallorca, suggesting more introductions of competitors and predators, and the presence of a flow with the mainland, may be the reason for the absence of a giant form of C. zimmermanni. However, some biological aspects of species (such as phylogeny or lifestyle) may also have an influential role. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","body mass estimation; body size evolution; gigantism; Island Rule; Mediterranean Islands; regression models; shrews; Soricidae",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975744792

Pollen analyses from deep-sea and lacustrine cores have well documented the evolution of floral communities in western Europe and suggest that climatic fluctuations influenced the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the exact impact of these climate changes on small faunal communities in southwest France is still poorly documented. Peyrazet Cave is an archaeological site located in the Lot (France) that has been excavated since 2008 and has yielded a Late Glacial sequence dated between 15.5 and 11.1 ka cal. BP. Thousands of small faunal remains resulting from a natural accumulation have been recovered. Investigation of this material has surprisingly revealed remains of two rodents that currently inhabit Central and Eastern Europe, the northern birch mouse (Sicista betulina) and the European hamster (Cricetus cricetus). The presence of these two taxa, which had migrated from the east and had been never documented in this region before the Late Glacial, is most likely related to short climatic fluctuations in the Late Glacial, suggesting more complex scenarios than traditionally accepted to explain the evolution of small faunal communities between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Biogeography; Colonization; Cricetus cricetus; Peyrazet; Refugia; Sicista betulina","biogeography; climate change; colonization; community response; evolution; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; late glacial; refugium; rodent; France; Lot; Midi-Pyrenees; Cricetinae; Cricetus cricetus; Mammalia; Rodentia; Sicista betulina",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958206566

Several settlements are confirmed by dry-stone structures or by shell middens. These data give precious indications on the occupation chronology of the area. Moreover they allow us, for the first time in Brittany, to reconstruct everyday life during the late Prehistoric period. A prerequisite to this reconstruction was a better understanding of the evolution of the environment during this period, which locally implies a better knowledge of paleogeographic changes related to Holocene sea-level rise as well as on floral and faunal resources. The results obtained through paleogeographic reconstructions show that the archipelago since 4500 bc was already disconnected from the mainland. The megalithic monuments must therefore have been erected and used by islanders present on the archipelago from the middle of the 5th to the 2nd millennium bc. The distribution of the megalithic tombs reveals landscape occupation strategies which respond to both cultural choices and natural constraints. Throughout the entire period, geographic isolation has continued to increase, although it did not imply strong cultural specificities. Nevertheless, the increasing remoteness of the islands has fostered the search for livelihoods based on the intense exploitation of coastal resources. Despite their focus on the sea, these people did not neglect what inland areas could offer as evidenced by the early agro-pastoral practices in the archipelago. © The Prehistoric Society.","early Bronze Age; environment exploitation; megalithic tombs; Molène archipelago; Neolithic; paleoenvironment.; shell middens; standing stones; variations in sea level",,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007020413

In total, 568 mandibles and 377 skulls of S. minutus from continental and island populations from Europe and Atlantic islands were examined using a geometric morphometrics approach, and the general relationships of mandible and skull size and shape with geographical and environmental variables were studied. Samples were then pooled into predefined geographical groups to evaluate the morphological differences among them using analyses of variance, aiming to contrast the morphological and genetic relationships based on morphological and genetic distances and ancestral state reconstructions, as well as assess the correlations of morphological, genetic, and geographical distances with Mantel tests. We found significant relationships of mandible size with geographical and environmental variables, fitting the converse Bergmann's rule; however, for skull size, this was less evident. Continental groups of S. minutus could not readily be differentiated from each other by shape. Most island groups of S. minutus were easily discriminated from the continental groups by being larger, indicative of an island effect. Moreover, morphological and genetic distances differed substantially and, again, island groups were distinctive morphologically. Morphological and geographical distances were significantly correlated, although this was not the case for morphological and genetic distances, indicating that morphological variation does not reflect genetic subdivision in S. minutus. Our analyses showed that environmental variables and insularity had important effects on the morphological differentiation of S. minutus. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London","Bergmann's rule; environmental correlates; geometric morphometrics; island rule; morphological evolution; resource rule; small mammal","Bergmann Rule; discriminant analysis; evolutionary biology; genetic differentiation; genetic variation; geographical variation; island biogeography; morphology; morphometry; phylogeography; skull; small mammal; Atlantic islands; Europe; Mammalia; Sorex hoyi; Sorex minutus; Soricinae; Soricomorpha",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978484119
