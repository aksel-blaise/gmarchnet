Advantages of the procedure are that it does not require integration or the use of fast Fourier transform techniques, and that bounds on the accuracy of the image contour reconstruction are easy to specify. Elliptic properties of the Fourier coefficients are shown and used for a convenient and intuitively pleasing procedure of normalizing a Fourier contour representation. Extension of the contour representation to arbitrary objects at arbitrary aspect angle is discussed. The procedures have direct application to a variety of pattern recognition problems that involve analysis of well-defined image contours. © 1982.",,"accuracy; closed contour; Fourier coefficients; image; pattern recognition; PATTERN RECOGNITION SYSTEMS",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019999399

The method is conceptually more parsimonious than more traditional biometric methods based on discrete linear and angular measurements. Most importantly, however, shape analysis captures a much higher proportion of the morphological information resident in any fossil than analyses based on discrete measurements. The number of harmonics required in an elliptic Fourier analysis can be estimated from a series of inverse Fourier reconstructions, or from the power spectrum. In most studies it is appropriate to normalize Fourier coefficients for size, although this information can be reincorporated at a later stage. The coefficients should probably not be standardized, unless there is evidence to suggest that high‐frequency information was genetically as important as low‐frequency information. Depending upon the aims of a particular study and the morphological disparity of the fossils in question, it might be appropriate to eliminate the first harmonic (‘best‐fitting’) ellipse from an analysis. Meaningful comparison of the left and right valves of bivalves requires the digitized coordinates of one or other to be mirrored prior to computation of the Fourier coefficients. □Biometric analysis, Bivalvia, elliptic Fourier analysis, morphometrics.

The results have been synthesized through a diachronic map, whose chronological phases are related to socio-economic and cultural human evolution. The house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) progression in the Mediterranean begins with a quick but limited diffusion in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin achieved around the 8th millennium BC. Until the 1st millennium BC, the invasive process seems to have stopped or drastically slowed, despite the increasing opportunities of passive transport during the Bronze Age. During the 1st millennium BC, there was mass colonization by the house mouse of the entire Western Mediterranean Basin and Northern Europe. We propose to explain this chronological gap in the colonization of the Eastern and Western Mediterranean using source-sink theory considering that the western environments acted like sinks until the first millennium BC. At that time the Western Mediterranean was fully opened to Eastern influences and migrations, and the human pressures on the environment drastically increased. This may have favoured definitively the adaptation of the house mouse to the Western commensal niches. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London.","Anthropization; Coevolution; Invasive species; Phylogeography; Source-sink; Subfossils","Bronze Age; coevolution; new record; phylogeography; source-sink dynamics; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; oceanic regions; World; Mus musculus",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-15944428237

Génome et Populations, CNRS URA 1493, Université Montpellier II, F-34095 Montpellier, France","On the basis of patterns of allele frequency variation in nuclear genes (Din et al., in press) it has been proposed that the house mouse M. musculus originated in the northern Indian subcontinent, from where it radiated in several directions to form the well-described peripheral subspecies (M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus and M. m. castaneus). Here we use a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny to test this hypothesis and to analyse the historical and demographic events that have accompanied this differentiation. This marker also provides a powerful means to check for genetic continuity between the central and peripheral populations. We studied restriction site polymorphism of samples from India and the Middle East as well as samples from the rest of Erusia and northern Africa. M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus are both monophyletic for mtDNA and belong to the subspecies- specific mtDNA lineages that have been described previously. Average nucleotide diversity is low in M. m. musculus (0.2-5%). It is not only higher in M. m. domesticus (0.7-0.9%) but the distribution of pairwise divergence is wider, and the rate of evolution in this branch appears to be higher than in M. m. musculus. The nucleotide diversity found in M. m. castaneus (0.4%) is due to the existence of two rather divergent linages with little intralineage variation. These two lineages are part of a diversified bush of the phylogenetic tree that also comprises several previously undescribed branches and includes all samples from the northern Indian subcontinent and Iran. The degree of diversity found in each of the samples from this region is high (1.2-2.4%) although they come from small geographic areas. This agrees well with the idea that the origin of the radiation was in the northern Indian subcontinent. However, as neither haplotypes on the M. m. domesticus nor on the M. m. musculus branches were found in this region, there appear to be important phylogeographic discontinuities between this central region and these peripherial subspecies. On the basis of the present results and the nuclear data (Din el al., in press), we propose that M. musculus originated in the north of the Indian subcontinent. Our calibration of the evolutionary rate of mtDNA in mice suggests that the mouse settlement in this region could be as old as 900 000 years. Possibly from there, a first radiation could have reached the Middle East and the Caspian Sea, where the M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus lineages, respectively, would have started to differentiate a few hundred thousand years ago, and from where they could have colonised the peripheral part of their ranges only recently. M. m. castaneus appears from its mtDNA to be a recent offshoot of the northern Indian population. This multiple and gradual radiation ultimately led to recent peripheral secondary contacts, such as the well-known European hybrid zone.","mitochondrial DNA; Mus musculus; phylogeography; radiation","Mus musculus; Musculus; Mus musculus castaneus; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus musculus musculus; house mouse; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeny; radiation; Africa, (North); Asia; India, (North); Middle East",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029659472

After successive immigration waves of the genus Mus into this zone from the late Pliocene to the upper Pleistocene, the house mouse appeared and remained confined to the easternmost Mediterranean Basin at the uppermost Pleistocene. The first progression of this species into the Mediterranean Basin occurred in the Middle East from the Epipaleolithic to the Neolithic. Subsequently, this species was found in the western Mediterranean Basin during the Bronze Age and in north‐west Europe during the Iron Age. In comparison to this latter zone, north central Europe was colonized relatively early, from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age which may, in fact, not only correspond to a much earlier invasion of Europe by M. musculus musculus but also suggest that the distribution of this subspecies extended much further west than it does nowadays, at a time when M. musculus domesticus was restricted to the Mediterranean zone. This archaeological survey is in agreement with genetic data which provide indications as to the speed, steps and pathways of progression of house mouse populations in western Eurasia.

Commensal house mice (associated with human habitations, farms, food stores and other anthropogenic habitats) typically show lower rates of dispersal than feral house mice (living in crops, natural and semi-natural habitats). However, early claims of long-term fine-scale genetic structure in commensal house mice (due to low rates of dispersal) are not supported by recent data. Dispersal becomes obligatory when habitat conditions deteriorate, but most dispersal occurs below the local environmental carrying capacity and is due to social interactions with conspecifics. Excursions are relatively frequent and probably allow mice to assess the quality of habitats before dispersing. Young males have the greatest tendency to disperse, apparently prompted mainly by aggressive interactions with dominant males. If they do disperse, females integrate into new groups more easily than do males. Dispersing house mice risk loss of condition or death, but may gain reproductive opportunities on arrival in a new location. House mice can be transported passively as stowaways with humans; this contributes to population persistence and genetic structure at regional scales and has allowed house mice to spread world-wide. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London.","Capture-mark-recapture; Home range; Migration; Movement; Mus musculus; Mus musculus domesticus; Population ecology; Population genetics; Population structure","population ecology; population genetics; population structure; Mus musculus",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-15944421259

This methodological paper examines approaches to optimizing the classification of specimens based on their outlines. This study examines the performance of four approaches to the mathematical representation of outlines and two different approaches to curve measurement as applied to a collection of feather outlines. A new approach to the dimension reduction necessary to carry out a CVA on this type of outline data with modest sample sizes is also presented, and its performance is compared to two other approaches to dimension reduction. Results: Two semi-landmark-based methods, bending energy alignment and perpendicular projection, are shown to produce roughly equal rates of classification, as do elliptical Fourier methods and the extended eigenshape method of outline measurement. Rates of classification were not highly dependent on the number of points used to represent a curve or the manner in which those points were acquired. The new approach to dimensionality reduction, which utilizes a variable number of principal component (PC) axes, produced higher cross-validation assignment rates than either the standard approach of using a fixed number of PC axes or a partial least squares method. Conclusion: Classification of specimens based on feather shape was not highly dependent of the details of the method used to capture shape information. The choice of dimensionality reduction approach was more of a factor, and the cross validation rate of assignment may be optimized using the variable number of PC axes method presented herein. © 2006 Sheets et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749530871

If this chronology could be dated precisely, many long-standing questions might be resolved. Here we report 18 high- precision 14C determinations which, when wiggle-matched to the radiocarbon calibration curve, provide a date within narrow limits. Inside this range, we can suggest the probable absolute dating of the dendrochronology because of a remarkable growth anomaly in the seventeenth century BC, for which we propose a correlation with major growth anomalies at 1628/1627 BC in the absolutely dated dendrochronologies of Europe and the United States. Many archaeological sites from several cultures in the eastern Mediterranean can now be dated with fine precision.

Generally, small mammals (less than 100 g) evolve into giant forms while large mammals (up to 100 g) evolve into dwarf forms. These changes, coupled with changes in other life, behavioural, physiological or demographic traits are referred to generally as the insular syndrome. We tested in this study the relative contribution of three factors - area of island, numbers of competitor species and number of predator species - to changes in body size of the woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) in the Western Mediterranean Sea. Our results, based on a comparative analysis using the phylogenetic independent contrasts method, indicate that the increase in body size is related both to the decrease of island size and to the lower number of predator species.

Data consisting of incidences of skeletal variants, cranial, and external measurements are from house mice (Mus musculus) on one Welsh and one Scottish island, black rats (Rattus rattus) on two Galapagos islands, and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) on three California Channel islands. We report extremely high rates of microevolution for many traits; 60% of all mensural traits measured changed at a rate of 600 d or greater (max. 2682 d). The proportion of all mensural traits evolving at 600-800 d (23%) was idiosyncratic and departed from an expected negative exponential distribution. We argue that selection, rather than founder events, is largely responsible for the substantial shifts in morphology seen among insular rodents. Examining individual traits, there is a trend towards the nose becoming longer and wider, while the skull becomes shallower, shown by both rats and mice on five different islands. We found a significant correlation between island size and degree of skeletal variant evolution and between island distance from the mainland (or nearest island) and degree of cranial and external character evolution. Thus, microevolution of rodents is greater on smaller and more remote islands.","Evolution; Islands; Mensural traits; Microevolution; Mus musculus; Peromyscus maniculatus; Rattus rattus; Rodents; Skeletal variants","animal; article; clinical trial; evolution; founder effect; genetic selection; genetics; geography; histology; meta analysis; mouse; Peromyscus; rat; rodent; time; Animals; Evolution; Founder Effect; Geography; Mice; Peromyscus; Rats; Rodentia; Selection (Genetics); Time Factors; Animalia; Cervidae; Cricetinae; Mus; Mus musculus; Musculus; Peromyscus; Peromyscus maniculatus; Rattus; Rattus rattus; Rodentia; Vertebrata",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035704965

Recently, a phylogenetic survey has shown that the non-commensal mouse of Cyprus was an unknown sister species of European wild mice. Here, we describe this new species of the genus Mus (Rodentia, Mammalia), namely Mus cypriacus sp. n., based on 19 specimens trapped in the southern part of Cyprus. These animals were first compared to Eurasian species of mice using both molecular genet-ics (complete D-loop sequences and nuclear gene intron) and cytogenetics to state on its systematic status. Then classical and geometric morphometric analyses on both cranial and dental characters have been performed to compare Mus cypriacus with circum-Mediterranean species and provide diagnositic morphological characters. Genetic data strongly support a sister species relationship of the new species to M. macedonicus, the closest mainland taxon. Morphometric analyses provide satisfying criteria for diagnosis of this species relative to other Mediterranean species. The most obvious phenotypic characteristics are its long tail and the allometric gigantism and shape robustness of its cranial and dental characters compared to other Mediterranean mice. The molecular clock and the history of the murine settlement on Cyprus are congruent and suggest that the common ancestor of M. cypriacus and M. macedonicus arrived on Cyprus during the Middle Pleistocene by a founder event on natural raft. The remoteness of Cyprus through time has prevented introgression from the mainland gene pool, and favoured phenotypic adaptation to competition release, leading to the allopatric speciation of M. cypriacus.

The reliability of classification of individual specimens into known groups based on their molars varied from 75 to 100%, depending on group and method used. Including 13 sliding semilandmarks to the analysis improved the detection of different kinds of size and shape variation as well as visualization of shape differences between studied groups. Correlation between phylogenetic and morphometric distances suggested about 80% contribution of phylogenetic inertia to the molar shape variation; moreover, the importance of localized versus global shape changes was similar in the detection of phylogenetic signals. Finally, shape changes along individual evolutionary lineages were revealed, suggesting a few cases of reversals, convergence and/or retention of ancestral shape. The evolution of mouse molars has thus been driven by random effects of drift together with stabilizing selection and convergence. © 2006 The Zoological Society of London.","Geometric morphometrics; Mus; Phenotypic evolution; Phylogeny; Thin-plate spline","classification; convergent evolution; morphometry; phenotype; phylogenetics; phylogeny; rodent; shape; tooth; Muridae; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750973039

A change in molar shape, which may be related to the development of a more grass-eating diet, corresponds to the global cooling beginning around 3 Ma and the subsequent increase in aridity in North Africa. Concurrently, size increased, which may be related to increased masticatory efficiency or to metabolic adaptation to the cooler environmental conditions according to Bergmann's rule. This adaptive response to changing environmental conditions corresponds to an acceleration of evolutionary rates in the lineage. The modalities of the evolutionary response in size and shape are probably controlled by intrinsic factors such as different genetic determinisms for both characters.",,"climate change; evolution; morphology; Pleistocene; Pliocene; rodent; (North); Africa; Murinae; Paraethomys; Paraethomys; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033383472

Some factors such as sex and age of the animals could be a source of within-group morphological variability interfering with among-groups patterns of differentiation. The relative importance of both sources of shape variation was investigated, in order to evaluate the robustness of patterns of fine-scale geographic differentiation. The increasing age of the animals, estimated by wear stages of the upper tooth row, caused significant variations in size and shape of the molars due to progressive abrasion of the cusps. It also involved shape changes of the mandible due to bone remodelling. However, these intrapopulational effects are of limited importance compared to geographic differentiation. Gene flow among populations should be favoured across mainland populations but lowered between mainland and islands, and to a lesser extent among close islands. Shape differences in molars are in agreement with this expected pattern of gene flow. Patterns of mandible differentiation rather match local variations in habitats. At this fine geographic scale, molar shape would vary according to the amount of genetic exchange among populations whereas mandible shape might be under local selective and/or functional constraints. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

In order to achieve this, the mouse species present on the archipelago were first compared with a set of continental mice. The differences between the continental and Canary Island samples, and among the Canary Island samples, provide insights into the processes of colonization and the subsequent insular evolution. Location: Canary archipelago. Methods: An outline analysis based on Fourier transformation was used to quantify shape differences between lower molars. Together with the fossil and modern Canary Island samples, a reference set of genotyped continental populations of the commensal Mus musculus and the wild Mus spretus was used for comparison. Results: The morphometric analysis showed that all the mouse specimens from the Canary Islands and Cape Verde belonged to Mus musculus domesticus. Lower molars of extant mice from La Gomera, El Hierro, Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and to a lesser degree from Lanzarote, were similar to those of genotyped M. m. domesticus from the continent, while teeth of extant mice from Fuerteventura were more divergent. Fossil mice from Fuerteventura were very similar to the extant representatives on this island, and similar to the fossil mice on the nearby islands of Lobos and La Graciosa. Main conclusions: The mouse present on the Canary archipelago has been identified as the house mouse M. m. domesticus. Based on the shape of the lower molar, the Canary Island mice are divergent from the continental ones, but the degree of divergence varies with the geography of the archipelago. Overall, populations from eastern islands are more divergent from the continental mice than populations from western ones. Fossil populations indicate that this situation was established several centuries ago. Two main factors may have contributed to this pattern: the appearance of different types of environment on the islands since the successful settlement of the mouse, and/or the number of subsequent introductions of continental individuals via shipping. © 2007 The Authors.","Anthropization; Colonization; Fourier transform; Geometric morphometry; Human migration; Insular syndrome; Island biogeography; Late Holocene; Mus musculus domesticus; Zooarchaeology","archipelago; colonization; commensal; dentition; divergence; evolution; fossil record; Fourier transform; Holocene; invasive species; island biogeography; morphometry; rodent; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Canary Islands; Cape Verde; Eurasia; Europe; Gomera; Gran Canaria; Hierro; Las Palmas; Macaronesia; Santa Cruz de Tenerife [(PRV) Canary Islands]; Southern Europe; Spain; Tenerife; Mus; Mus musculus; Mus musculus domesticus; Mus spretus; Nesomys rufus; Rodentia",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34447628023

Bataillon, Montpellier, 34060, France","The genetic structure of six western Mediterranean island populations of Mus musculus domesticus were investigated by means of an electrophoretic analysis at 34 loci and compared to that of five neighbouring mainland populations. No reduction in variability (H = 0.09 for both island and mainland samples) was observed in the island populations except for a very small island (6 ha), in which one‐third of the variability was lost. Patterns of colonization inferred from a Wagner cluster analysis and the distribution of rare variants suggest that, although these island populations are clearly related to European mainland mice, their genetic structure is the result of multiple founding events from sources dispersed throughout the Mediterranean Basin. Furthermore, the presence of the same rare alleles in Sardinia, Corsica and Piana, suggest that the three islands share a common history of colonization. Estimates of genetic distance and gene flow indicate that the level of genie differentiation is greater between island and mainland populations that between the latter due to geographic isolation. Multiple founder events and post‐colonization evolution are the factors that best explain the observed levels of genie variability and differentiation in these Mediterranean islands.

The southern clade was until now undetected and characterises mice from Israel. Nuclear genes also show some amount of regional differentiation tending to separate the southern M. macedonicus from the northern ones. These results point towards the fact that the eastern Mediterranean short-tailed mouse, which was seen as a fairly homogeneous monotypic species, has in fact a more complex phylogeographic history than has been suspected, and that it warrants the existence of two subspecies. The reasons for this non-uniformity probably ought to be looked for in the history of faunal movements linked to glacial periods, underlining the possible existence of at least two refugia south of the Caucasus.","Glacial refuges; M. macedonicus spretoides; Mitochondrial divergence; Mus macedonicus; Subspecies","genetic differentiation; glaciation; mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; refugium; rodent; Bulgaria; cladistics; genetic variability; Greece; Israel; life history; subspecies; wild species; animal; article; chemistry; chromosome; genetics; haplotype; mitochondrion; molecular genetics; mouse; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; Southern Europe; wild animal; Europe; Mediterranean Region; Mus macedonicus; mitochondrial DNA; Animals; Animals, Wild; Base Sequence; Chromosomes; DNA, Mitochondrial; Haplotypes; Mediterranean Region; Mice; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036856505

Shape was shown to be significantly correlated both with longitude and latitude in M. macedonicus, yet the correlation between morphometric and geographic distances was not significant, and morphometric differences between Asian and European populations were not higher than those within the particular continents. The phylogenetic signal was found to be stronger in dental characters than in cranial ones, however, overall concordance between the pattern of morphometric variation and the presumed history of M. macedonicus was rather weak. In both species, the dorsal and ventral sides of the skull were shown to covary in many aspects though there were also some differences between them, making the functional interpretation of these differences difficult.
