The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of “shape complexity,” one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For example, a given “model” shape and a sensed “data” shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces. © 1992 IEEE",,"Computer Vision; 3-D Registration; Motion Estimation; Image Processing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026821209

The problem is investigated of translating, rotating, reflecting and scaling the m configurations to minimize the goodness-of-fit criterion Σi=1m Σi=1n Δ2(Pj(i)Gi), where Gi is the centroid of the m points Pi(i) (i = 1, 2, ..., m).

For interpolation of a surface over a fixed set of nodes in the plane, the bending energy is a quadratic form in the heights assigned to the surface. The spline is the superposition of eigenvectors of the bending energy matrix, of successively larger physical scales, over a tilted flat plane having no bending energy at all. When these splines are paired, one representing the x-coordinate of another form and the other the y-coordinate, they aid greatly in the modeling of biological shape change as deformation. In this context, the pair becomes an interpolation map from R2 to R2 relating two sets of landmark points. The spline maps decompose, in the same way as the spline surfaces, into a linear part (an affine transformation) together with the superposition of principal warps, which are geometrically independent, affine-free deformations of progressively smaller geometrical scales. The warps decompose an empirical deformation into orthogonal features more or less as a conventional orthogonal functional analysis decomposes the single scene. This paper demonstrates the decomposition of deformations by principal warps, extends the method to deal with curving edges between landmarks, relates this formalism to other applications of splines current in computer vision, and indicates how they might aid in the extraction of features for analysis, comparison, and diagnosis of biological and medical images. © 1989 IEEE","Affine transformations; biharmonic equation; biomedical image analysis; deformation; principal warps; quadratic variation; shape; thin-plate splines; warping",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957563017

Studies of the external morphological characteristics of a fossil organism are not sufficient to extract all the information for a paleontological study. Nowadays observations of internal structures become increasingly important, but these observations should be non-destructive in order to preserve the important specimens. Conventional microtomography allows performing part of these investigations. Nevertheless, the best microtomographic images are obtained using third-generation synchrotrons producing hard X-rays, such as the ESRF. Firstly, monochromatisation avoids beam hardening that is frequently strong for paleontological samples. Secondly, the high beam intensity available at synchrotron radiation sources allows rapid data acquisition at very high spatial resolutions, resulting in precise mapping of the internal structures of the sample. Thirdly, high coherence leads to additional imaging possibilities: phase contrast radiography, phase contrast microtomography and holotomography. These methods greatly improve the image contrast and therefore allow studying fossils that cannot be investigated by conventional microtomography due to a high degree of mineralisation or low absorption contrast. Thanks to these different properties and imaging techniques, a synchrotron radiation source and the ESRF in particular appears as an almost ideal investigation tool for paleontology.",,"Absorption; Hardening; Nondestructive examination; Radiography; Synchrotron radiation; X ray analysis; European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF); Holotomography; Paleontological samples; Tomography",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645318198

We outline a general methodological framework by which missing information about biological specimens can be estimated using geometric morphometric methods and discuss how this relates to effective paleoanthropological use of incomplete and distorted crania. Combining digital data resources with geometric morphometrics, we go beyond the assembly of fragments on the computer. As in a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle, we first assemble the virtual pieces manually. Then we use landmarks, several hundred semilandmarks, and information from complete specimens to estimate missing coordinates and correct for distortion simultaneously. One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no ""all-purpose"" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is widely recognized that a considerable endocranial expansion occurred throughout the evolution of the genus Homo. This article aims to evaluate whether this phenomenon was the outcome of distinct evolutionary lineages, reaching similar brain expansions but through different trajectories. Endocranial morphology was studied in a sample of fossil hominines by multivariate approaches using both traditional metrics and geometric morphometrics. The analysis was focused on the transition from a generalized archaic pattern within the genus Homo to the modern morphology and compared with changes that occurred along the Neandertal lineage. The main result was the identification of two different evolutionary trajectories, in which a similar expansion in endocranial size has been reached by different changes in shape. Along the Neandertal lineage we observed maintenance of an ""archaic"" endocranial model, in which a large amount of variability is based on a single allometric trend.

Of this material, the cranium is especially important for testing hypotheses about the systematics and behavioural characteristics of this species, but is partly distorted from fracturing, displacement and plastic deformation. Here we present a detailed virtual reconstruction of the TM 266 cranium that corrects these distortions. The reconstruction confirms that S. tchadensis is a hominid and is not more closely related to the African great apes. Analysis of the basicranium further indicates that S. tchadensis might have been an upright biped, suggesting that bipedalism was present in the earliest known hominids, and probably arose soon after the divergence of the chimpanzee and human lineages. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Gene transfer; Human engineering; Plastic deformation; Cranium (TM 266-01-60-1); Hominid; Mandibular fragments; Sahelanthropus tchadensis; Genetic engineering; ape; article; chimpanzee; female; fossil; gorilla; hominid; human; image reconstruction; male; mandible; nonhuman; priority journal; skull; virtual reality; animal; brain; Chad; computer simulation; face; fossil; histology; history; hominid; Pan troglodytes; phylogeny; physiology; Hominidae; Pan troglodytes; Sahelanthropus tchadensis; Animals; Brain; Chad; Computer Simulation; Face; Fossils; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Humans; Pan troglodytes; Phylogeny; Skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17144418483

Non-invasive techniques such as computed tomography scans can be used to generate accurate three-dimensional images of structures, such as skulls, which can form the basis of an accurate finite element model.

A historically influential interpretation of this morphology hypothesizes that loads applied to the premolars during feeding had a profound influence on the evolution of australopith craniofacial form. Here, we test this hypothesis using finite element analysis in conjunction with comparative, imaging, and experimental methods. We find that the facial skeleton of the Australopithecus type species, A. africanus, is well suited to withstand premolar loads. However, we suggest that the mastication of either small objects or large volumes of food is unlikely to fully explain the evolution of facial form in this species. Rather, key aspects of australopith craniofacial morphology are more likely to be related to the ingestion and initial preparation of large, mechanically protected food objects like large nuts and seeds. These foods may have broadened the diet of these hominins, possibly by being critical resources that australopiths relied on during periods when their preferred dietary items were in short supply. Our analysis reconciles apparent discrepancies between dietary reconstructions based on biomechanics, tooth morphology, and dental microwear. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Diet; Evolution; Face; Finite element analysis; Hominin","article; Australopithecus africanus; biomechanics; craniofacial morphology; finite element analysis; hominid; human; mastication; Pleistocene; priority journal; skeleton; Animals; Biomechanics; Diet; Ecology; Evolution; Feeding Behavior; Finite Element Analysis; Fossils; Hominidae; Macaca; Models, Theoretical; Muscles; Paleontology; Software; Australopithecus; Australopithecus africanus",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-60549109629

Young Drive South, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1606, United States","The widespread availability of three-dimensional imaging and computational power has fostered a rapid increase in the number of biologists using finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate the mechanical function of living and extinct organisms. The inevitable rise of studies that compare finite element models brings to the fore two critical questions about how such comparative analyses can and should be conducted: (1) what metrics are appropriate for assessing the performance of biological structures using finite element modeling? and, (2) how can performance be compared such that the effects of size and shape are disentangled? With respect to performance, we argue that energy efficiency is a reasonable optimality criterion for biological structures and we show that the total strain energy (a measure of work expended deforming a structure) is a robust metric for comparing the mechanical efficiency of structures modeled with finite elements. Results of finite element analyses can be interpreted with confidence when model input parameters (muscle forces, detailed material properties) and/or output parameters (reaction forces, strains) are well-documented by studies of living animals. However, many researchers wish to compare species for which these input and validation data are difficult or impossible to acquire. In these cases, researchers can still compare the performance of structures that differ in shape if variation in size is controlled. We offer a theoretical framework and empirical data demonstrating that scaling finite element models to equal force: surface area ratios removes the effects of model size and provides a comparison of stress-strength performance based solely on shape. Further, models scaled to have equal applied force:volume ratios provide the basis for strain energy comparison. Thus, although finite element analyses of biological structures should be validated experimentally whenever possible, this study demonstrates that the relative performance of un-validated models can be compared so long as they are scaled properly. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The frontal lobe is involved in functions such as creative thinking, planning of future actions, decision making, artistic expression, aspects of emotional behavior, as well as working memory, language and motor control. It is often claimed that the frontal lobe is disproportionately larger in humans than in other species, but conflicting reports exist on this issue. The brain of the apes in particular remains largely unknown. In this report we measure the volume of the frontal lobe as a whole and of its main sectors (including cortex and immediately underlying white matter) in living humans, and in post-mortem brains of the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, gibbon and the macaque using three-dimensional reconstructions of magnetic resonance (MR) scans of the brain. On the basis of these data we suggest that although the absolute volume of the brain and the frontal lobe is largest in humans, the relative size of the frontal lobe is similar across hominoids, and that humans do not have a larger frontal lobe than expected from a primate brain of the human size. We also report that the relative size of the sectors of the frontal lobe (dorsal, mesial, orbital) is similar across the primate species studied. Our conclusions are preliminary, because the size of our sample, although larger than in previous studies, still remains small. With this caveat we conclude that the overall volume of the frontal lobe in hominids enlarged in absolute size along with the rest of the brain, but did not become relatively larger after the split of the human line from the ancestral African hominoid stock. Aspects other than relative volume of the frontal lobe have to be responsible for the cognitive specializations of the hominids. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Frontal lobe; Hominid cognition; Hominoid brain","Alocasia macrorrhizos; Hominidae; Hominoidea; Homo; Hylobates sp.; Macaca; Pan troglodytes; Pongo pygmaeus; Primates; animal; Anthropoidea; article; cognition; comparative study; evolution; frontal lobe; gorilla; Haplorhini; histology; hominid; human; Macaca; Pan troglodytes; species difference; zoo animal; Animals; Animals, Zoo; Cognition; Evolution; Frontal Lobe; Gorilla gorilla; Hominidae; Humans; Hylobates; Macaca mulatta; Pan troglodytes; Pongo pygmaeus; Species Specificity",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031111903

Validation is a critical step in the analysis, without which researchers cannot evaluate the extent to which the model represents or is relevant to the real biological condition. We discuss the method's considerable potential as a tool to test biomechanical hypotheses, and major hurdles involved in doing so reliably, from the perspective of researchers interested in functional morphology and paleontology. We conclude with a case study to illustrate how researchers deal with many of the factors and assumptions involved in finite element analysis. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Finite-element analysis; Functional morphology; Mastication; Paleoanthropology; Primates","biomechanics; conference paper; finite element analysis; functional morphology; geometry; mastication; mathematical model; model; paleoanthropology; paleontology; primate; priority journal; validation process; Anatomy; Animals; Biomechanics; Body Patterning; Computer Simulation; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Models, Biological; Primates; Reproducibility of Results",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-16444378814

In biology it is a unified developmental phenomenon. Homologies among and within individuals intergrade in several ways, so historical homology cannot be separated sharply from repetitive homology. Nevertheless, the consequences of historical and repetitive homologies can be mutually contradictory. A detailed discussion of the rise and fall of the “premolar‐analogy” theory of homologies of mammalian molar‐tooth cusps exemplifies such a contradiction. All other hypotheses of historical homology which are based on repetitive homology, such as the foliar theory of the flower considered phyletically, are suspect.

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65549154351

It acts as a guidance for jaw movements and as a fulcrum for force generation. The joint is subjected to loading which causes tensions and deformations in its cartilaginous structures. These are assumed to be a major determinant for development, maintenance and also degeneration of the joint. To analyze the distribution of tensions and deformations in the cartilaginous structures of the jaw joint during jaw movement, a dynamical model of the human masticatory system has been constructed. Its movements are controlled by muscle activation. The articular cartilage layers and articular disc were included as finite-element (FE) models. As this combination of rigid-body and FE modeling had not been applied to musculoskeletal systems yet, its benefits and limitations were assessed by simulating both unloaded and loaded jaw movements. It was demonstrated that joint loads increase with muscle activation, irrespective of the external loads. With increasing joint load, the size of the stressed area of the articular surfaces was enlarged, whereas the peak stresses were much less affected. The results suggest that the articular disc enables distribution of local contact stresses over a much wider area of the very incongruent articular surfaces by transforming compressive principal stress into shear stress. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The application of high-resolution imaging in evaluating bone structure has evolved from an in vitro technology for small specimens to an emerging clinical research tool for in vivo studies in humans. However, many technical and practical challenges remain to translate these techniques into established clinical outcomes. Questions/purposes: We reviewed use of high-resolution CT for evaluating trabecular microarchitecture and cortical ultrastructure of bone specimens ex vivo, extension of these techniques to in vivo human imaging studies, and recent studies involving application of high-resolution CT to characterize bone structure in the context of skeletal disease. Methods: We performed the literature review using PubMed and Google Scholar. Keywords included CT, MDCT, micro-CT, high-resolution peripheral CT, bone microarchitecture, and bone quality. Results: Specimens can be imaged by micro-CT at a resolution starting at 1 μm, but in vivo human imaging is restricted to a voxel size of 82 μm (with actual spatial resolution of ~ 130 μm) due to technical limitations and radiation dose considerations. Presently, this mode is limited to peripheral skeletal regions, such as the wrist and tibia. In contrast, multidetector CT can assess the central skeleton but incurs a higher radiation burden on the subject and provides lower resolution (200-500 μm). Conclusions: CT currently provides quantitative measures of bone structure and may be used for estimating bone strength mathematically. The techniques may provide clinically relevant information by enhancing our understanding of fracture risk and establishing the efficacy of antifracture for osteoporosis and other bone metabolic disorders. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"bone metabolism; bone radiography; bone strength; bone structure; clinical evaluation; clinical research; conference paper; ex vivo study; high resolution computer tomography; human; image analysis; image display; in vivo study; metabolic disorder; micro-computed tomography; multidetector computed tomography; osteoporosis; priority journal; quantitative analysis; systematic review; tibia; trabecular bone; wrist",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960966080

Recently, several authors have suggested that one of the most significant hominid-like traits of australopithecines, delayed maturation, may not after all be valid2-4. This is a radical departure from Mann's5 classic study of australopithecine maturation and palaeodemography based on dental eruption patterns. The resolution of this debate has important implications for the history of the biological and social evolution of the human species. In view of the controversies generated by recent studies6, and particularly because the Taung skull is the type specimen of Australopithecus africanus, we have investigated the relevant anatomy of the Taung 'child' using computerized tomography.

It is possible that this dimorphism is determined by sex steroids such as testosterone (T) and oestrogen (E), and several studies on the perception of such characteristics have been based on this assumption, but those studies focussed mainly on the relationship of male faces with circulating hormone levels; the corresponding biology of the female face remains mainly speculative. This paper is concerned with the relative importance of prenatal T and E levels (assessed via the 2D:4D finger length ratio, a proxy for the ratio of T/E) and sex in the determination of facial form as characterized by 64 landmark points on facial photographs of 106 Austrians of college age. We found that (i) prenatal sex steroid ratios (in terms of 2D:4D) and actual chromosomal sex dimorphism operate differently on faces, (ii) 2D:4D affects male and female face shape by similar patterns, but (iii) is three times more intense in men than in women. There was no evidence that these effects were confounded by allometry or facial asymmetry. Our results suggest that studies on the perception of facial characteristics need to consider differential effects of prenatal hormone exposure and actual chromosomal gender in order to understand how characteristics have come to be rated 'masculine' or 'feminine' and the consequences of these perceptions in terms of mate preferences. © 2005 The Royal Society.","2D : 4D; Digit ratio; Face shape; Geometric morphometrics; Hormones; Sexual dimorphism","estrogen; testosterone; hormone; adult; allometry; article; controlled study; face; female; femininity; finger; human; human experiment; male; masculinity; mate choice; prenatal development; prenatal exposure; priority journal; sex determination",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-26244436868

Paleoanthropologists employ enamel thickness in paleodietary and taxonomic studies regarding earlier hominins, but variation in enamel thickness within the genus Homo has not been thoroughly explored despite its potential to discriminate species and its relevance to studies of growth and development. Radiographic two-dimensional studies indicate that Neandertal molar enamel is thin relative to the thick enamel of modern humans, although such methods have limited accuracy. Here we show that, measured via accurate high-resolution microtomographic imaging, Neandertal molar enamel is absolutely and relatively thinner than modern human enamel at most molar positions. However, this difference relates to the ratio of coronal dentine volume to total crown volume, rather than the quantity of enamel per se. The absolute volume of Neandertal molar enamel is similar to that of modern humans, but Neandertal enamel is deposited over a larger volume of coronal dentine, resulting in lower average (and relative) enamel thickness values. Sample sizes do not permit rigorous intragroup comparisons, but Neandertal molar tissue proportions evince less variation than the modern human sample. Differences in three- and two-dimensional enamel thickness data describing Neandertal molars may be explained by dimensional reduction. Although molar tissue proportions distinguish Neanderthals from recent Homo sapiens, additional study is necessary to assess trends in tissue proportions in the genus Homo throughout the Pleistocene. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiments use the isotropic error model, which assumes equal and independent variation at each landmark. The case of three landmarks in the plane (i.e., triangles) was emphasized because it could be investigated systematically and the results displayed on the printed page. The amount of error in the estimates was displayed as RMSE surfaces over the space of all possible configurations of three landmarks. Patterns of bias were shown as vector fields over this same space. Experiments were also performed using particular combinations of four or more landmarks in both two and three dimensions. It was found that the generalized Procrustes analysis method produced estimates with the least error and no pattern of bias. Averages of Bookstein shape coordinates performed well if the longest edge was used as the baseline. The method of moments (Stoyan, 1990, Model. Biomet. J. 32, 843) used in EDMA (Lele, 1993, Math. Geol. 25, 573) exhibits larger errors. When variation is not small, it also shows a pattern of bias for isosceles triangles with one side much shorter than the other two and for triangles whose vertices are approximately collinear causing them to resemble their own reflections. Similar problems were found for the log-distance method of Rao and Suryawanshi (1996, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 95, 4121).

Because much information is contained within the 3D histological architecture of bone, including an ontogenetic record, crucial for understanding the paleobiology of fossil species, the application of phase-contrast synchrotron tomography to bone at higher resolutions is potentially of great interest.

These new specimens support previous interpretations of the locomotor adaptations of this species and indicate that A. zeuxis was a robust, slowly moving arboreal quadruped. While the previously described distal articular region of the humerus is virtually identical with the same region in many extant ceboids and the Miocene hominoid Pliopithecus vindobonensis, the more proximal parts of the humerus show many primitive “prosimianlike” features not found in the limbs of extant anthropoids. The primitive features include the absence of a distinct deltoid plane, a broad shallow bicipital groove, a large brachialis flange, and an entepicondylar foramen. In most features, the humerus of Aegyptopithecus zeuxis is more primitive than the hypothetical last common ancestor of extant cercopithecoids and hominoids based on neontological comparisons. This supports other lines of evidence indicating that the hominoids from the Egyptian Oligocene are morphologically ancestral to both Old World monkeys and apes.

This conclusion has various implications with regard to the evolution of human feeding behaviour. However, human dental anatomy suggests a capacity to withstand high loads and two-dimensional lever models greatly simplify muscle architecture, yielding less accurate results than three- dimensional modelling using multiple lines of action. Here, to our knowledge, in the most comprehensive three-dimensional finite element analysis performed to date for any taxon, we ask whether the traditional view that the bite of H. sapiens is weak and the skull too gracile to sustain high bite forces is supported. We further introduce a new method for reconstructing incomplete fossil material. Our findings show that the human masticatory apparatus is highly efficient, capable of producing a relatively powerful bite using low muscle forces. Thus, relative to other members of the superfamily Hominoidea, humans can achieve relatively high bite forces, while overall stresses are reduced. Our findings resolve apparently discordant lines of evidence, i.e. the presence of teeth well adapted to sustain high loads within a lightweight cranium and mandible. © 2010 The Royal Society.","Form and function; Fossil; Hominoidea","anatomy; cranium; dental health; feeding behavior; fossil record; functional morphology; human evolution; muscle; taxonomy; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional modeling; Hominoidea; Homo sapiens",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650050997

We present a comparison of the expression of lower molar dental traits (cusp 6, cusp 7, trigonid crest pattern, and protostylid) at the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) in a variety of extant and fossil hominoid taxa, in order to assess the contribution of the EDJ to the morphology of these traits at the outer enamel surface (OES). Molars (n = 44) were imaged nondestructively using high-resolution microCT, and three-dimensional surface models of the EDJ and OES were created to compare trait expression at each surface. Our results indicate that these dental traits originate at the EDJ, and that the EDJ is primarily responsible for their degree of expression at the OES. Importantly, variable trait morphology at the EDJ (often not easily recognizable at the OES) indicates that different developmental processes can produce traits that appear similar at the enamel surface, suggesting caution in intra- and intertaxonomic comparisons. The results also highlight the importance of the EDJ for understanding the morphological development of discrete traits, and for establishing graded scales of variation to compare trait frequency among groups for the purpose of taxonomic and/or phylogenetic analysis. Finally, this study demonstrates that imaging the EDJ of both worn and unworn fossil hominin teeth provides a novel source of information about tooth development and variation in crown morphology. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

By modeling the stress response to feeding forces in a finite-element skull model (with appropriate boundary conditions), one can compare the axis of distortion and orientation of stress and strain in the model to the degree of movement at actual sutural contacts in the real skull. Hypotheses detailing the effect of introducing patency or flexibility on mechanical performance can be constructed and subsequently tested. In this study, the correlation between stress environment, cranial strength, and sutural morphology and mobility is investigated in the cranium of the large theropod dinosaur Allosaurus fragilis. Theropods are an especially interesting model system as their skulls were massive (over 100 cm in some cases), may have generated extremely large bite forces, yet patent sutures persisted between many of the facial bones.

Fifteen Neanderthal specimens are compared with a Holocene human sample, as well as with a small number of European Middle Pleistocene hominins, and early anatomically modern and European Upper Palaeolithic humans. Compared with Holocene humans the bony labyrinth of Neanderthals can be characterized by an anterior semicircular canal arc which is smaller in absolute and relative size, is relatively narrow, and shows more torsion. The posterior semicircular canal arc is smaller in absolute and relative size as well, it is more circular in shape, and is positioned more inferiorly relative to the lateral canal plane. The lateral semicircular canal arc is absolutely and relatively larger. Finally, the Neanderthal ampullar line is more vertically inclined relative to the planar orientation of the lateral canal. The European Upper Palaeolithic and early modern humans are most similar, although not fully identical to Holocene humans in labyrinthine morphology. The European Middle Pleistocene hominins show the typical semicircular canal morphology of Neanderthals, with the exception of the arc shape and inferiorly position of the posterior canal and the strongly inclined ampullar line. The marked difference between the labyrinths of Neanderthals and modern humans can be used to assess the phylogenetic affinities of fragmentary temporal bone fossils. However, this application is limited by a degree of overlap between the morphologies. The typical shape of the Neanderthal labyrinth appears to mirror aspects of the surrounding petrous pyramid, and both may follow from the phylogenetic impact of Neanderthal brain morphology moulding the shape of the posterior cranial fossa. The functionally important arc sizes of the Neanderthal semicircular canals may reflect a pattern of head movements different from that of modern humans, possibly related to aspects of locomotor behavior and the kinematic properties of their head and neck. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Although genotypes exist and are inherited in a discrete space convenient for many sorts of analyses, the causation of key phenomena such as natural selection and disease takes place in a continuous phenotype space whose relationship to the genotype space is only dimly grasped. Direct study of genotypes with minimal reference to phenotypes is clearly insufficient to elucidate these phenomena. Phenomics, the comprehensive study of phenotypes, is therefore essential to understanding biology. For all of the advances in knowledge that a genomic approach to biology has brought, awareness is growing that many phenotypes are highly polygenic and susceptible to genetic interactions. Prime examples are common human diseases. Phenomic thinking is starting to take hold and yield results that reveal why it is so critical. The dimensionality of phenotypic data are often extremely high, suggesting that attempts to characterize phenotypes with a few key measurements are unlikely to be completely successful. However, once phenotypic data are obtained, causation can turn out to be unexpectedly simple. Phenotypic data can be informative about the past history of selection and unexpectedly predictive of long-term evolution. Comprehensive efforts to increase the throughput and range of phenotyping are an urgent priority.","Dimensionality; Disease; G matrix; Genotype-phenotype map; Natural selection","causal attribution; conference paper; controlled study; gene function; gene interaction; gene number; genetic trait; genetic variability; genotype phenotype correlation; human; molecular evolution; natural selection; phenomics; phenotype; priority journal; specific combining ability; animal; evolution; genetic selection; genotype; review; Animals; Evolution; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Humans; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-76549110852

For construction of true models of the surgical site, two concepts were pursued. CT image data of six patients were used for model manufacturing by a conventional 21/2 axis milling system. The material used was polyurethane foam. Alternatively, in one patient a stereolithography was produced on the basis of the 3D reconstructed CT data. This new manufacturing device uses a photocurable monomer, hardened by a UV-laser. The spatial resolution of the system is about 0.1 mm. 3D-reconstructions were performed on a personal computer. Data were then transferred into a surface oriented structure to control a stereolithographic modeling device. Time for transfer was 70 min. The production of the modelled cranium took a total time of 59 h. Accuracy was found to be much higher in stereolithography than in milled models. The model served for surgical planning. The long time for production was caused by inadequate computer capacities, which are configured for much less complex objects in computer aided design. Furthermore the programs for the machine control are optimized for technical purposes. If theses conditions are improved, stereolithography could be an attractive alternative to milling of medical models. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,"polyurethan foam; article; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; craniofacial surgery; human; intermethod comparison; microcomputer; pediatric surgery; priority journal; treatment planning; Child; Comparative Study; Computer-Aided Design; Human; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microcomputers; Models, Anatomic; Skull; Surgery, Plastic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026707830

We present algorithms to automatically determine these distances as well as geometric correspondences. This approach is motivated by the aspiration of students of natural science to understand the continuity of form that unites the diversity of life. At present, scientists using physical traits to study evolutionary relationships among living and extinct animals analyze data extracted from carefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks). Identifying and recording these landmarks is time consuming and can be done accurately only by trained morphologists. This necessity renders these studies inaccessible to nonmorphologists and causes phenomics to lag behind genomics in elucidating evolutionary patterns. Unlike other algorithms presented for morphological correspondences, our approach does not require any preliminary marking of special features or landmarks by the user. It also differs from other seminal work in computational geometry in that our algorithms are polynomial in nature and thus faster, making pairwise comparisons feasible for significantly larger numbers of digitized surfaces. We illustrate our approach using three datasets representing teeth and different bones of primates and humans, and show that it leads to highly accurate results.","Homology; Mobius transformations; Morphometrics; Procrustes","anatomical variation; article; bone; comparative study; evolutionary algorithm; evolutionary developmental biology; extinct species; feasibility study; geometry; human; morphometrics; natural science; nonhuman; primate; priority journal; surface property; tooth; Algorithms; Models, Anatomic; Animalia; Primates",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-81055141406

Because of the precarious state of preservation of the original material, we applied entirely noninvasive methods of fossil reconstruction and morphometry, using a combination of computed tomography, computer graphics, and stereolithography. After electronic restoration, the isolated original pieces were recomposed on the computer screen using external and internal anatomical clues to position the bone fragments and mirror images to complete missing parts. The inferred effects of general compressive deformation that occurred during fossilization were corrected by virtual decompression of the skull. The resulting new reconstruction of the Le Moustier 1 skull shows morphologic features close to the typical Neanderthal adult state. Residual asymmetry of skeletal parts can be traced to in vivo skeletal modification: the left mandibular joint shows signs of a healed condylar fracture, and the anatomy of the occipital region suggests mild plagiocephaly. Using micro-CT analysis, the left incus could be recovered from the matrix filling of the middle ear cavity. Its morphometric dimensions are similar to those of the La Ferrassie III incus.

The skulls of Petralona and, to a somewhat lesser degree, Broken Hill are extremely pneumatized. Previously und escribed features associated with pneumatization are detailed, along with their possible functional significance, polarity, and potential for understanding hominid cranial variation. Petralona and Broken Hill also exhibit a dramatic suite of cerebral features that is probably related to extensive pneumatization of the skull, namely frontal lobes that are tilted and located behind rather than over the orbits, laterally flared temporal lobes, marked occipital projection, and basal location of the cerebellum. Comparison of the anterior cranial fossae of Petralona, Broken Hill, and Arago 21 suggests that external resemblance of skulls may not always correlate with endocranial similarity. We believe that stereolithographic reconstructions have the potential for helping to resolve difficult questions about the origins of Neanderthal and anatomically modern people. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","3D-reconstruction; Computer-tomography; Endocranial morphology; Middle pleistocene hominids; Pneumatisation; Stereolithography","Hominidae; Animalia; Hominidae; Primates; cranial morphology; evolution; hominid; Pleistocene; skull; stereolithography; animal; archeology; article; audiovisual equipment; Australia; classification; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; evolution; histology; hominid; human; radiography; skull; Spain; Animals; Archaeology; Australia; Evolution; Hominidae; Humans; Models, Anatomic; Skull; Spain; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Australia, New South Wales, Broken Hill",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031462839

Nonetheless, FEA is usually applied without considering changes in contacts between antagonistic teeth during the occlusal power stroke. In this contribution we show how occlusal information can be used to investigate the stress distribution with 3D FEA in lower first molars (M1). The antagonistic crowns M1 and P2-M1 of two dried modern human skulls were scanned by μCT in maximum intercuspation (centric occlusion) contact. A virtual analysis of the occlusal power stroke between M1 and P2-M1 was carried out in the Occlusal Fingerprint Analyser (OFA) software, and the occlusal trajectory path was recorded, while contact areas per time-step were visualized and quantified. Stress distribution of the M1 in selected occlusal stages were analyzed in strand7, considering occlusal information taken from OFA results for individual loading direction and loading area. Our FEA results show that the stress pattern changes considerably during the power stroke, suggesting that wear facets have a crucial influence on the distribution of stress on the whole tooth. Grooves and fissures on the occlusal surface are seen as critical locations, as tensile stresses are concentrated at these features. Properly accounting for the power stroke kinematics of occluding teeth results in quite different results (less tensile stresses in the crown) than usual loading scenarios based on parallel forces to the long axis of the tooth. This leads to the conclusion that functional studies considering kinematics of teeth are important to understand biomechanics and interpret morphological adaptation of teeth. © 2011 The Authors.

This study examined variation in trigonid crest patterns on the enamel and dentine surfaces to (1) evaluate the concordance between the morphology of trigonid crests at the inner dentine and the outer enamel surfaces; (2) examine their developmental origin(s); and (3) examine trait polarity through comparison with Australopithecus africanus and Pan. The sample included 73 H. neanderthalensis, 67 contemporary H. sapiens, 5 A. africanus, and 24 Pan lower molars. Results indicate general agreement in the morphology observed on the dentine and enamel surfaces. All but one H. neanderthalensis molar shows some trigonid crest development, whereas trigonid crests occur in low frequency in contemporary humans. Pan and A. africanus both also show high frequencies of a continuous trigonid crest. However, the origin of the trigonid crest differs among groups. H. neanderthalensis uniquely possesses a 'middle' trigonid crest that originates from the mesial accessory ridge of one or both cusps. Based on our results we suggest that presence of a continuous middle trigonid crest at the dentine surface is primitive and the lack of any trigonid crest is derived. Genetic drift may explain the high frequency of trigonid crests in H.neanderthalensis. However, H. neanderthalensis still appears to be derived relative to Pan and A. africanus in its high frequency of the mesial-mesial trigonid crest configuration.

These techniques are all used in studies of form and function in biology, but only recently have they been combined in novel ways to facilitate biomechanical modelling that takes account of variations in form, can statistically compare performance, and relate performance to form and its covariates.

Seven derived features of LB1's cerebral cortex are detailed: a caudally-positioned occipital lobe, lack of a rostrally-located lunate sulcus, a caudally-expanded temporal lobe, advanced morphology of the lateral prefrontal cortex, shape of the rostral prefrontal cortex, enlarged gyri in the frontopolar region, and an expanded orbitofrontal cortex. These features indicate that LB1's brain was globally reorganized despite its ape-sized cranial capacity (417 cm3). Neurological reorganization may thus form the basis for the cognitive abilities attributed to H. floresiensis. Because of its tiny cranial capacity, some workers think that LB1 represents a Homo sapiens individual that was afflicted with microcephaly, or some other pathology, rather than a new species of hominin. We respond to concerns about our earlier study of microcephalics compared with normal individuals, and reaffirm that LB1 did not suffer from this pathology. The intense controversy about LB1 reflects an older continuing dispute about the relative evolutionary importance of brain size versus neurological reorganization. LB1 may help resolve this debate and illuminate constraints that governed hominin brain evolution. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, a set of experimentally produced bifacial tools are incorporated into the analyses to isolate the behavioral pattern underpinning identified variation in the archaeological assemblage. The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture. The intensity with which this strategy was applied seems to have been mediated by the availability of raw material that was suitable for the production of large bifacial tools. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with other primates, modern humans have more coronally orientated petrous bones and a higher degree of basicranial flexion, resulting in a deeper and wider posterior cranial fossa. It has been argued that this derived condition results from a phylogenetic increase in the size of the brain and its subcomponents (infra- and supratentorial volumes) relative to corresponding lengths of the cranial base (posterior and anterior, respectively). The purpose of this study was to test such evolutionary hypotheses in a prenatal ontogenetic context. We measured the degree of basicranial flexion, petrous reorientation, base lengths, and endocranial volumes from high-resolution magnetic resonance images (hrMRI) of 46 human fetuses ranging from 10-29 weeks of gestation. Bivariate comparisons with age revealed a number of temporal trends during the period investigated, most notable of which were coronal rotation of the petrous bones and basicranial retroflexion (flattening). Importantly, the results reveal significant increases of relative endocranial sizes across the sample, and the hypotheses therefore predict correlated variations of cranial base flexion and petrous orientation in accordance with these increases. Statistical analyses did not yield results as predicted by the hypotheses. Thus, the propositions that base flexion and petrous reorientation are due to increases of relative endocranial sizes were not corroborated by the findings of this study, at least for the period investigated. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Basicranium; Fetal ontogeny; Human evolution; MRI; Relative encephalization","brain size; human; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ontogeny; petrous bone; phylogeny; posterior fossa; primate; review; skull; skull base; Animals; Brain; Cephalometry; Embryonic and Fetal Development; Humans; Pan troglodytes; Phylogeny; Species Specificity",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036322042

This scaffold is built by the median mesethmoid, and the paired vomer and ethmoid bones. The mesethmoid ossifies within the nasal septum cartilage. The bilateral ethmoid segregates respiratory and olfactory regions, and its geometry offers insight into the functional, developmental, and genomic organization of the nose. It forms through partial coalescence of separate elements known as turbinals, which in Monodelphis comprise the maxilloturbinal, nasoturbinal, five endoturbinals, and two ectoturbinals. Geometry of the ethmoid increases respiratory mucosal surface area by a factor of six and olfactory mucosal surface by nearly an order of magnitude. Respiratory epithelium warms and humidifies inspired air, recovers moisture as air is exhaled, and may help mediate brain temperature. In contrast, the olfactory skeleton functions as a series of small funnels that support growth of new olfactory neurons throughout life. Olfactory mucosa lines the mouth of each funnel, forming blind olfactory recesses known as the ethmoid cells, and neuronal axons are funneled from the epithelium through tiny olfactory foramina in the cribriform plate, into close proximity with target glomeruli in the olfactory bulb of the brain where each axon makes its first synapse. The skeleton may thus mediate topological correspondence between odorant receptor areas in the nose with particular glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, enabling growth throughout life of new olfactory neurons and proper targeting by their axons. The geometric arrangement of odorant receptors suggests that a measure of volatility may be a component in the peripheral olfactory code, and that corresponding glomeruli may function in temporal signal processing. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Computed tomography; Ethmoid; Mesethmoid; Turbinals; Vomer; Vomeronasal organ","Didelphidae; Monodelphis; Monodelphis domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-28644434499

While the overall structure of the semicircular canals and cochlea is similar across therian mammals, their detailed morphology varies even among closely related groups. As such, the shape of the labyrinth carries valuable functional and phylogenetic information. Here we introduce a new, semilandmark-based three-dimensional geometric morphometric approach to shape analysis of the labyrinth, as a major improvement upon previous metric studies based on linear measurements and angles. We first provide a detailed, step-by-step description of the measurement protocol. Subsequently, we test our approach using a geographically diverse sample of 50 recent modern humans and 30 chimpanzee specimens belonging to Pan troglodytes troglodytes and P. t. verus. Our measurement protocol can be applied to CT scans of different spatial resolutions because it primarily quantifies the midline skeleton of the bony labyrinth. Accurately locating the lumen centre of the semicircular canals and the cochlea is not affected by the partial volume and thresholding effects that can make the comparison of the outer border problematic. After virtually extracting the bony labyrinth from CT scans of the temporal bone, we computed its midline skeleton by thinning the encased volume. On the resulting medial axes of the semicircular canals and cochlea we placed a sequence of semilandmarks. After Procrustes superimposition, the shape coordinates were analysed using multivariate statistics. We found statistically significant shape differences between humans and chimpanzees which corroborate previous analyses of the labyrinth based on traditional measurements. As the geometric relationship among the semilandmark coordinates was preserved throughout the analysis, we were able to quantify and visualize even small-scale shape differences. Notably, our approach made it possible to detect and visualize subtle, yet statistically significant (P=0.009), differences between two chimpanzee subspecies in the shape of their semicircular canals. The ability to discriminate labyrinth shape at the subspecies level demonstrates that the approach presented here has great potential in future taxonomic studies of fossil specimens. © 2012 The Authors.

However, the accuracy of these assessments has never been evaluated. Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes). Lastly, the absence of resharpening effects raises questions about the validity of the reduction thesis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been suggested that enamel thickness increases from first to third molars, perhaps due to varying functional demands or developmental constraints, but this has not been tested with appropriate statistical methods. We quantified enamel cap area (c), dentine area (b), and enamel-dentine junction length (e) in coronal planes of sections through the mesial and distal cusps in 57 permanent molars of Pan and 59 of Pongo, and calculated average (c/e) and relative enamel thickness (([c/e]/√b) * 100). Posteriorly increasing or decreasing trends in each variable and average (AET) and relative enamel thickness (RET) were tested among molars in the same row. Differences between maxillary and mandibular analogues and between mesial and distal sections of the same tooth were also examined. In mesial sections of both genera, enamel cap area significantly increased posteriorly, except in Pan maxillary sections. In distal sections of maxillary teeth, trends of decreasing dentine area were significant in both taxa, possibly due to hypocone reduction. Significant increases in AET and RET posteriorly were found in all comparisons, except for AET in Pongo distal maxillary sections. Several significant differences were found between maxillary and mandibular analogues in both taxa. Relative to their mesial counterparts, distal sections showed increased enamel cap area and/or decreased dentine area, and thus increased AET and RET. This study indicates that when AET and RET are calculated from samples of mixed molars, variability is exaggerated due to the lumping of tooth types. To maximize taxonomic discrimination using enamel thickness, tooth type and section plane should be taken into account. Nonetheless, previous findings that African apes have relatively thinner enamel than Pongo is supported for certain molar positions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most challenging of these applications is Finite Element Analysis (FEA), a potentially powerful non-destructive tool in the prediction of mechanical behaviour. Geometric morphometrics is another typically computer-based approach commonly applied in morphological studies that allows for shape differences between specimens to be quantified and analysed. There has been some integration of these two fields in recent years. Although a number of shape warping approaches have been developed previously, none are easily accessible. Here we present an easily accessed method for warping meshes based on freely available software and test the effectiveness of the approach in FEA using the varanoid lizard mandible as a model. We further present new statistical approaches, strain frequency plots and landmark point strains, to analyse FEA results quantitatively and further integrate FEA with geometric morphometrics. Using strain frequency plots, strain field, bending displacements and landmark point strain data we demonstrate that the mechanical behaviour of warped specimens reproduces that of targets without significant error. The influence of including internal cavity morphology in FEA models was also examined and shown to increase bending displacements and strain magnitudes in FE models. The warping approaches presented here will be useful in a range of applications including the generation and analysis of virtual reconstructions, generic models that approximate species means, hypothetical morphologies and evolutionary intermediaries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Finite Element Analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Landmark point; Varanid; Warping","biomechanics; finite element method; geometry; lizard; morphology; morphometry; quantitative analysis; statistical analysis; three-dimensional modeling; accuracy; anatomic landmark; article; computational biomechanics; computer analysis; computer program; controlled study; finite element analysis; geometric morphometrics; image reconstruction; lizard; mandible; mouth cavity; nonhuman; principal component analysis; priority journal; process optimization; quantitative analysis; species comparison; three dimensional virtual reconstruction; Varanus acanthurus; Varanus exanthematicus; Varanus gouldii; Varanus komodoensis; Varanus salvadorii; Animals; Biomechanics; Biometry; Computational Biology; Finite Element Analysis; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lizards; Mandible; Models, Anatomic; Phylogeny; Stress, Mechanical; Squamata; Varanidae; Varanoidea",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857305496

Here, we investigate the possible relationship between the local stress environment arising from masticatory loadings and the emergence of the supraorbital torus in the developing face of the crab-eating macaque Macaca fascicularis. By using finite element analysis (FEA), we are able to evaluate the hypothesis that strain energy density (SED) magnitudes are high in subadult individuals with resulting bone growth in the supraorbital torus. We developed three micro-CT-based FEA models of M. fascicularis skulls ranging in dental age from deciduous to permanent dentitions and validated them against published experimental data. Applied masticatory muscle forces were estimated from physiological cross-sectional areas of macaque cadaveric specimens. The models were sequentially constrained at each working side tooth to simulate the variation of the bite point applied during masticatory function. Custom FEA software was used to solve the voxel-based models and SED and principal strains were computed. A physiological superposition SED map throughout the face was created by allocating to each element the maximum SED value from each of the load cases. SED values were found to be low in the supraorbital torus region throughout ontogeny, while they were consistently high in the zygomatic arch and infraorbital region. Thus, if the supraorbital torus arises to resist masticatory loads, it is either already adapted in each of our subadult models so that we do not observe high SED or a lower site-specific bone deposition threshold must apply. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Finite element analysis; Muscle physiological cross-sectional area; Primates","animal tissue; article; biomechanics; bone development; bone growth; cadaver; controlled study; deciduous tooth; dentition; experimental model; face development; Macaca; mastication; morphological adaptation; muscle force; nonhuman; stress strain relationship; weight bearing; zygoma; Adaptation, Physiological; Age Factors; Animals; Biomechanics; Bite Force; Facial Bones; Finite Element Analysis; Macaca fascicularis; Models, Anatomic; Sex Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-60549117552

The complexity of craniofacial skeletal morphology makes it difficult to evaluate these hypotheses with in vivo bone strain data. In this paper, new in vivo bone strain data from the intraorbital surfaces of the supraorbital torus, postorbital bar and postorbital septum, the anterior surface of the postorbital bar, and the anterior root of the zygoma are combined with published data from the supraorbital region and zygomatic arch to evaluate the validity of a finite-element model (FEM) of a macaque cranium during mastication. The behavior of this model is then used to test hypotheses regarding the overall deformation regime in the craniofacial haft of macaques. This FEM constitutes a hypothesis regarding deformation of the facial skeleton during mastication. A simplified verbal description of the deformation regime in the macaque FEM is as follows. Inferior bending and twisting of the zygomatic arches about a rostrocaudal axis exerts inferolaterally directed tensile forces on the lateral orbital wall, bending the wall and the supraorbital torus in frontal planes and bending and shearing the infraorbital region and anterior zygoma root in frontal planes.

Thus, there is potential for fossil taxa, particularly fossil hominins, to be distinguished at similar taxonomic levels using molar crown morphology. Unfortunately, due to occlusal attrition, the original crown morphology is often absent in fossil teeth, and this has limited the amount of shape information used to discriminate hominin molars. The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) of molar teeth preserves considerable shape information, particularly in regard to the original shape of the crown, and remains present through the early stages of attrition. In this study, we investigate whether the shape of the EDJ of lower first and second molars can distinguish species and subspecies of extant Pan. Micro-computed tomography was employed to nondestructively image the EDJ, and geometric morphometric analytical methods were used to compare EDJ shape among samples of Pan paniscus (N = 17), Pan troglodytes troglodytes (N = 13), and Pan troglodytes verus (N = 18). Discriminant analysis indicates that EDJ morphology distinguishes among extant Pan species and subspecies with a high degree of reliability. The morphological differences in EDJ shape among the taxa are subtle and relate to the relative height and position of the dentine horns, the height of the dentine crown, and the shape of the crown base, but their existence supports the inclusion of EDJ shape (particularly those aspects of shape in the vertical dimension) in the systematic analysis of fossil hominin lower molars. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Geometric morphometrics; Micro-computed tomography; Sliding semilandmarks; Tooth morphology","article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; dentin; discriminant analysis; enamel; micro-computed tomography; molar tooth; morphometrics; nonhuman; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; subspecies; tooth crown; Animals; Classification; Dental Enamel; Dentin; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Molar; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Principal Component Analysis; Species Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Pan; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Pan troglodytes troglodytes; Pan troglodytes verus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349089351

Engineering techniques such as finite element analysis are now commonly used to calculate stress and strain fields, but if we are to fully accept these methods we must be confident that the applied loading regimens are reasonable. Multibody dynamics analysis (MDA) is a relatively new three dimensional computer modeling technique that can be used to apply varying muscle forces to predict joint and bite forces during static and dynamic motions. The method ensures that equilibrium of the structure is maintained at all times, even for complex statically indeterminate problems, eliminating nonphysiological constraint conditions often seen with other approaches. This study describes the novel use of MDA to investigate the influence of different muscle representations on a macaque skull model (Macaca fascicularis), where muscle groups were represented by either a single, multiple, or wrapped muscle fibers. The impact of varying muscle representation on stress fields was assessed through additional finite element simulations. The MDA models highlighted that muscle forces varied with gape and that forces within individual muscle groups also varied; for example, the anterior strands of the superficial masseter were loaded to a greater extent than the posterior strands. The direction of the muscle force was altered when temporalis muscle wrapping was modeled, and was coupled with compressive contact forces applied to the frontal, parietal and temporal bones of the cranium during biting. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Bite force; Finite element analysis; Macaque; Multibody dynamics analysis; Muscle force","article; compressive strength; computer model; finite element analysis; frontal bone; jaw muscle; Macaca; male; masseter muscle; mastication; masticatory muscle; muscle cell; muscle force; musculoskeletal function; nonhuman; priority journal; skull; temporal bone; temporalis muscle; Animals; Biomechanics; Bite Force; Finite Element Analysis; Macaca fascicularis; Masticatory Muscles; Skull; Temporomandibular Joint; Macaca fascicularis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-43149107457

Finite element analyses simulating molar and premolar biting were used to test the hypothesis that the cranium of A. africanus is structurally more rigid than that of Macaca fascicularis, an Old World monkey that lacks derived australopith facial features. Previously generated finite element models of crania of these species were subjected to isometrically scaled loads, permitting a direct comparison of strain magnitudes. Moreover, strain energy (SE) in the models was compared after results were scaled to account for differences in bone volume and muscle forces. Results indicate that strains in certain skeletal regions below the orbits are higher in M. fascicularis than in A. africanus. Moreover, although premolar bites produce von Mises strains in the rostrum that are elevated relative to those produced by molar biting in both species, rostral strains are much higher in the macaque than in the australopith. These data suggest that at least the midface of A. africanus is more rigid than that of M. fascicularis. Comparisons of SE reveal that the A. africanus cranium is, overall, more rigid than that of M. fascicularis during premolar biting. This is consistent with the hypothesis that this hominin may have periodically consumed large, hard food items. However, the SE data suggest that the A. africanus cranium is marginally less rigid than that of the macaque during molar biting. It is hypothesized that the SE results are being influenced by the allometric scaling of cranial cortical bone thickness. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Bone; Diet; Finite element analysis; Hominin; Human evolution; Skull; Strain","adaptation; allometry; article; Australopithecus africanus; biomechanics; bone; craniofacial morphology; diet; feeding; finite element analysis; Macaca; monkey; muscle; nonhuman; premolar tooth; priority journal; skeleton; skull; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Biomechanics; Diet; Evolution; Finite Element Analysis; Hominidae; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Skull; Australopithecus africanus; Cercopithecidae; Crania; Macaca fascicularis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950872977

Deviations from developmental stability, arising from disruptive effects of environmental and genetic stresses, can be measured in terms of fluctuating asymmetry, a particularly sensitive indicator of the ability to cope with these stresses during ontogeny. In an inbred Adriatic island population, we expected dental arch fluctuating asymmetry 1) to be higher than in an outbred sample from the same island, and 2) within this population, to increase with the level of inbreeding. Due to environmental stress, we also expected to find higher fluctuating asymmetry in the outbred island population than in an urban reference group from the same country. The material consisted of 506 dental casts of 253 children from 1) the island of Hvar, and 2) Zagreb, Croatia. Three-dimensional coordinates of 26 landmarks spanning the arches were digitized. The analysis partitioned the asymmetry of arch forms into components for directional and fluctuating bilateral asymmetry, using the appropriate Procrustes method (geometric morphometrics). The results corroborated the hypotheses. Fluctuating asymmetry was found to be higher on the island than in Zagreb in all groups and in both jaws, and increased significantly with endogamy level in the lower jaw. There was no significant directional asymmetry in the Zagreb sample and likewise none in the upper jaws of the outbred island group, but significant directional asymmetry in both jaws of the inbred population and also in the lower jaws of the outbred island group. These results suggest an environmental as well as a genetic influence on dental arch asymmetry. Although the lower jaws expressed these two stresses almost additively, the upper jaws appeared to be better buffered. The role of directional asymmetry as a potential indicator of craniofacial developmental instability clearly merits further attention. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Directional asymmetry; Endogamy; Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Human isolates","adolescent; anatomical variation; article; coping behavior; craniofacial development; Croatia; dental arch asymmetry; environmental factor; female; fluctuating asymmetry; genotype; geometry; heredity; human; inbreeding; jaw; male; morphometrics; ontogeny; school child; stress; tooth arch; Adolescent; Child; Consanguinity; Dental Arch; Europe, Eastern; Female; Geography; Humans; Male; Mandible",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-29244475055

These papers are salient examples of the use of FEA to test hypotheses regarding structure-function relationships in complexly shaped biological objects such as skulls and in areas of the skeleton that are otherwise impervious to study. FEA is also a powerful tool for studying patterns of stress and strain in fossil animals and artificial constructs hypothesized to represent ancestral conditions. FEA has been used deductively, to study patterns of growth and development, and to investigate whether skull shapes can be created from amorphous blocks using an iterative approach of loading and removing elements. Several of the papers address methodological issues, such as the relative importance of loading conditions and material properties for generating an accurate model and the validation of models using in vivo strain data. Continuing improvements in model building techniques will make possible increased application of FEA to study the functional effects of variation in morphology, whether through ontogenetic or phylogenetic transformations. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Bone strain; Dinosaurs; Finite-element analysis; Fossils; Primates; Skulls; Stress","accuracy; biomechanics; bone stress; conference paper; finite element analysis; fossil; mathematical model; morphology; nonhuman; priority journal; publication; skull; structure activity relation; validation process; vertebrate; Anatomy; Animals; Biomechanics; Body Patterning; Computer Simulation; Evolution; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Models, Biological; Reproducibility of Results; Vertebrates",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-16444384226

Indeed, from the earliest commentaries on the Victoria West, it has frequently been thought of as a 'large Levallois' variant. The hypothesis that VW cores are accurately characterised as 'large Levallois' is tested here using a comparative 3D geometric morphometric (GM) methodology. GM methods are powerful statistical tools for shape analysis that offer many advantages over traditional means of shape quantification and comparison. The use of landmarks to capture shape variation allows for the preservation of the full geometry, as well as enabling the more precise description of shape versus size. Moreover, biological studies have shown that the use of landmarks allows for a flexible approach to comparing specific aspects of overall morphology. Here, we employ GM to analyse differences in core surface morphology in a range of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, including Victoria West examples (total n = 639 artefacts). In comparison with cores from non-handaxe Mode 1, Acheulean handaxes, and Levallois cores, the Victoria West share shape affinities with both Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores. However, when compared directly with a group of large Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores from Baker's Hole (UK), the Victoria West were found to more closely resemble handaxes, while the Baker's Hole set are simply isometrically-scaled Levallois cores. These analyses show that, despite broad technological and qualitative morphological similarities with Levallois cores, Victoria West cores are morphologically more similar to Lower Palaeolithic artefact forms, such as handaxes, and are in some respects distinct from Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores. In line with other recent analyses, our results support suggestions that the Victoria West technique is an extension of longstanding Acheulean traditions for the preparation of biface blanks, but with its own distinct characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Finite element analysis (FEA) is an ideal technique to investigate the biomechanical implications of these specializations, but it is essential to understand fully the degree of influence of the different input parameters of the FE model to have confidence in the model's predictions. This study evaluates the sensitivity of FE models of rodent crania to elastic properties of the materials, loading direction, and the location and orientation of the models' constraints. Three FE models were constructed of squirrel, guinea pig and rat skulls. Each was loaded to simulate biting on the incisors, and the first and the third molars, with the angle of the incisal bite varied over a range of 45°. The Young's moduli of the bone and teeth components were varied between limits defined by findings from our own and previously published tests of material properties. Geometric morphometrics (GMM) was used to analyse the resulting skull deformations. Bone stiffness was found to have the strongest influence on the results in all three rodents, followed by bite position, and then bite angle and muscle orientation. Tooth material properties were shown to have little effect on the deformation of the skull. The effect of bite position varied between species, with the mesiodistal position of the biting tooth being most important in squirrels and guinea pigs, whereas bilateral vs. unilateral biting had the greatest influence in rats. A GMM analysis of isolated incisor deformations showed that, for all rodents, bite angle is the most important parameter, followed by elastic properties of the tooth.

From these determinations, several important implications emerge concerning current interpretations of 'tempo and mode' in early hominid brain evolution: 1) already by the early Middle Pleistocene, at least one African hominid species, Homo heidelbergensis, had reached an endocranial capacity within the normal range of modern humans; 2) in spite of its large endocranial capacity, estimates of Bodo's encephalization quotient fall below those found in a large sample of Homo sapiens (both fossil and recent) and Neandertals; and 3) the greatest burst of brain expansion in the Homo lineage may not have been in the last several hundred thousand years, but rather much earlier in the Lower to early Middle Pleistocene.

This picture of the paleoanthropologist still retains a grain of truth. Indeed, many new sites were discovered under troublesome conditions in the recent past and have added substantial information about our origins. But on another front, probably less sensational but no less important, are contributions stemming from the analysis of the already discovered fossils. With the latter, a rapid evolution in anthropologic research took place concurrently with advances in computer technology. After ambitious activities by a handful of researchers in some specialized laboratories, a methodologic inventory evolved to extract critical information about fossilized specimens, most of it preserved in the largely inaccessible interior as unrevealed anatomic structures. Many methodologies have become established but, for various reasons, access to both the actual and the digitized fossils is still limited. It is time for more transparency, for a glasnost in paleoanthropology. Herein are presented some answers to the question of how a high-tech approach to anthropology can be integrated into a predominantly conservative field of research, and what are the main challenges for development in the future. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","3D-data; Computed tomography; CT; Human evolution; Magnetic resonance imaging; Morphometry; MRI; Paleoanthropology; Virtual anthropology","fossil; morphometrics; paleoanthropology; preservation; priority journal; review; Animals; Anthropology, Cultural; Evolution; Forensic Medicine; Hominidae; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Paleontology; Skull; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; User-Computer Interface",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035881064

We investigated the association between facial attractiveness at young adulthood and reproductive life history-number of children and pregnancies-in women of a rural community. For the analysis of reproductive success, we divided the sample into women who used contraceptives and women who did not. Introducing two-dimensional geometric morphometric methodology, we analysed which specific characteristics in facial shape drive the assessment of attractiveness and covary with lifetime reproductive success. A set of 93 (semi)landmarks was digitized as two-dimensional coordinates in postmenopausal faces. We calculated the degree of fluctuating asymmetry and regressed facial shape on facial attractiveness at youth and reproductive success. Among women who never used hormonal contraceptives, we found attractive women to have more biological offspring than less attractive women. These findings are not affected by sociodemographic variables. Postmenopausal faces corresponding to high reproductive success show more feminine features-facial characteristics previously assumed to be honest cues to fertility. Our findings support the notion that facial attractiveness at the age of mate choice predicts reproductive success and that facial attractiveness is based on facial characteristics, which seem to remain stable until postmenopausal age. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Facial attractiveness; Facial shape; Fluctuating asymmetry; Geometric morphometrics; Reproductive success",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867897283

We extracted digital cranial endocasts from CT scans of a growth series of skulls of Monodelphis domestica, the gray short-tailed opossum, as a preliminary assessment of the amount of intraspecific variation in mammalian endocranial morphology. The goals of this study were 1) to provide an anatomical description to document developmental changes in endocranial morphology of M. domestica and 2) to examine ontogenetic and individual variation with respect to phylogenetic characters of endocranial cavities that are known to be variable between different mammalian taxa. In this study, ""ontogenetic variation"" refers to variation between specimens of different ages whereas ""individual variation"" (i.e., polymorphism) is restricted to variation between specimens of comparable age. Aside from size, changes in shape account for the greatest amount of morphological variation between the endocasts of different ages. Endocast length, width, and volume increase with age for the growth series. Relative olfactory bulb cast size increases with age in the growth series, but the relative size of the parafloccular casts shows a slight negative allometric trend through ontogeny. More than one-third of the phylogenetic characters of the endocranial cavity we examined showed some sort of variation (ontogenetic, individual, or both). This suggests that although endocasts are potentially informative for systematics, both ontogenetic and individual variation affect how endocranial characters are scored for phylogenetic analysis. Further studies such as this are necessary to determine the taxonomic extent of significant intraspecific variation of these endocranial characters. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Computed tomography; Cranial endocast; Intraspecific variation; Opossum; Polymorphism","animal; article; body weight; forebrain; genetic variability; genetics; growth, development and aging; histology; mesencephalon; opossum; organ size; regression analysis; rhombencephalon; skull; three dimensional imaging; Animals; Body Weight; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mesencephalon; Opossums; Organ Size; Prosencephalon; Regression Analysis; Rhombencephalon; Skull; Variation (Genetics); Didelphidae; Mammalia; Metatheria; Monodelphis domestica",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34848813811

Southwest China has been identified from genetic research as a hotspot of human diversity, containing ancient mtDNA and Y-DNA lineages, and has yielded a number of human remains thought to derive from Pleistocene deposits. We have prepared, reconstructed, described and dated a new partial skull from a consolidated sediment block collected in 1979 from the site of Longlin Cave (Guangxi Province). We also undertook new excavations at Maludong (Yunnan Province) to clarify the stratigraphy and dating of a large sample of mostly undescribed human remains from the site. Methodology/Principal Findings: We undertook a detailed comparison of cranial, including a virtual endocast for the Maludong calotte, mandibular and dental remains from these two localities. Both samples probably derive from the same population, exhibiting an unusual mixture of modern human traits, characters probably plesiomorphic for later Homo, and some unusual features. We dated charcoal with AMS radiocarbon dating and speleothem with the Uranium-series technique and the results show both samples to be from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition: ~14.3-11.5 ka. Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis suggests two plausible explanations for the morphology sampled at Longlin Cave and Maludong. First, it may represent a late-surviving archaic population, perhaps paralleling the situation seen in North Africa as indicated by remains from Dar-es-Soltane and Temara, and maybe also in southern China at Zhirendong. Alternatively, East Asia may have been colonised during multiple waves during the Pleistocene, with the Longlin-Maludong morphology possibly reflecting deep population substructure in Africa prior to modern humans dispersing into Eurasia. © 2012 Curnoe et al.",,"Archean; article; Asian; bone age; China; dentition; evolution; geography; Holocene; human; human tissue; mandible; Pleistocene; plesiomorphy; radiometric dating; skull; stratigraphy; Aborigine; body size; Caucasian; Eskimo; face; fossil; histology; Negro; physiology; principal component analysis; skull; time; tooth crown; uranium; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biological Evolution; Body Size; China; Crowns; European Continental Ancestry Group; Face; Fossils; Geography; Humans; Inuits; Mandible; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Principal Component Analysis; Radiometric Dating; Skull; Time Factors; Uranium",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858178764

MATERIALS AND METHODS. Nine Egyptian mummies were evaluated on helical CT using 1-mm axial scans obtained from the skull vertex to the mid cervical spine. Systematic evaluation of the skull and intracranial contents, paranasal sinuses, craniocervical junction, orbits, temporal bones including the middle and inner ears, teeth, and superficial soft tissues was undertaken. Reformatted and volume-rendered images were generated. RESULTS. CT findings indicated that the intracranial contents of the nine mummies varied tremendously. Destruction of the anterior skull base structures in mummies without intracranial contents suggested a transnasal, transethmoidal approach to excerebration. A large amount of expensive embalming material within the skull of one mummy suggests that he may have been a royal pharaoh. A cleft palate deformity was identified in a child mummy. Temporal bone analysis revealed one case of asymmetric mastoid air cell erosion and dehiscence, which is strongly suggestive of prior mastoiditis. Craniocervical junction abnormalities and ossicular chain disruption in several mummies were attributed to postmortem damage. The orbital structures had intentionally been removed in several mummies. Dental disease was ubiquitous among the adult specimens. CONCLUSION. The systematic evaluation of the head and skull base of mummies with CT can provide insight into the life, disease, death, and postmortem treatment of these ancient Egyptians.",,"article; atlantooccipital joint; Egypt; head; high resolution computer tomography; human; orbit; paleopathology; paranasal sinus; priority journal; skull base; temporal bone",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036105124

In physical anthropology, the discrimination of taxa and the qualitative and quantitative description of ontogenetic or evolutionary change require, of course, the analysis of morphological features. Since the 1960s, a remarkable amount of fossil material was excavated, some of it still awaiting a detailed first analysis, some of it requiring re-examination by more developed methods. While the fossil record grew continuously, a revolution in anthropological research took place with advances in computer technology in the 1980s: a handful of innovative researchers working in specialized anthropology laboratories or medical departments developed the methodological inventory needed to extract critical information from subjects in vivo and from fossilized remains. A considerable part of this information is preserved in the physically heretofore inaccessible interior of anatomical structures. Virtual Anthropology (VA) is a means of making them visible and measurable. Thus, VA also allows access to 'hidden' landmarks; in addition, the large number of semilandmarks accessible on the form enhances the power of Geometric Morphometrics analysis. Furthermore, the density information in volume data allows manipulations such as segmentation, impossible with the real, physical object. Moreover, metric body measurements generally, and cranial measurements specifically, are also an important source of information for the analysis of the ontogenetic development of the skeletal system, and-last but not least-for clinical use (e.g., operation planning, operation simulation, prothetics). Thus, there developed a fruitful interdisciplinary cooperation between statistics, medicine, and physical anthropology.","3D-data; CT-scans; Electronic preparation; Geometric morphometrics; Paleoanthropology; Segmentation; Stereolithography; Virtual anthropology","computer assisted tomography; computer interface; human; image processing; physical anthropology; review; Anthropology, Physical; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035288119

Materials and methods: The teeth of a dried modern human skull were micro-CT scanned in maximum intercuspation contact with a Viscom X8060 NDT X-ray system. A kinematic analysis of the surface contacts between antagonistic right upper and lower teeth during the power stroke was carried out in the Occlusal Fingerprint Analyser (OFA) software. Stress distribution in the lower right second premolar was analysed using three-dimensional finite element (FE) methods, considering occlusal information taken from OFA results (cases 4-5). The output was compared to that obtained by loading the tooth with a single point force (cases 1-3). Results: Results for cases 1-3 differ considerable from those of cases 4-5. The latter show that tensile stresses might be concentrated in grooves and fissures of the occlusal surface, in the marginal ridges, in the disto-lingual and in the distal side of the root. Moreover, the premolar experiences high tensile stresses in the buccal aspect of the crown, supporting the idea that abfraction might be a dominant factor in the aetiology of non-carious cervical lesions. Conclusions: The application of FE methods in dental biomechanics can be advanced considering individual wear patterns. Clinical relevance: More realistic occlusal loadings are of importance for both new developments in prosthetic dentistry and improvements of materials for tooth restoration, as well to address open questions about the worldwide spread problem of dental failure. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Biomechanics; Functional morphology; Loading conditions; Occlusal wear pattern","comparative study; dental procedure; finite element analysis; human; micro-computed tomography; pathophysiology; premolar tooth; procedures; radiography; Bicuspid; Dental Stress Analysis; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; X-Ray Microtomography",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894541796

Here, we first document the evolutionary changes of root size and shape of the anterior upper and lower dentition in a broad chronological and geographical framework. We then use the size and shape differences between RMH and Neanderthals to classify several isolated teeth from Kebara cave and Steinheim, and to interpret the anterior tooth roots of the Tabun C2 mandible.Our samples comprise permanent mandibular and maxillary incisors and canines from early Homo, Neanderthals, as well as extant and fossil modern humans (N = 359). In addition to root length, we measured cervical root diameter and area, total root volume, root pulp volume and root surface area from μCT scans. We quantified root shape variation using geometric morphometrics.Our results show that Neanderthals have not only significantly larger anterior roots than RMH overall, but also different root shapes for each tooth type. In the context of the 'teeth-as-tools' hypothesis, this could be an adaptation to better sustain high or frequent loads on the front teeth.We demonstrate that the two isolated incisors stored with the Steinheim skull are very likely recent. Tabun C2 shows an anterior dentition similar in size and shape to Neanderthals while its molar roots are non-Neanderthal. Two of the five isolated teeth from Kebara are classified as Neanderthals.Interestingly, early modern humans overlap with Neanderthals and RMH in root size and shape. Anterior roots of the Lower and Middle Pleistocene specimens are at least as large as Neanderthals, suggesting that Neanderthals retained a primitive pattern, which should prompt caution in the assessment of the earliest forms of modern humans. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ancestral condition; Canines; Hypercementosis; Incisors; Micro-CT; Teeth-as-tools hypothesis","comparative study; dentition; evolution; fossil record; morphology; morphometry; Neanderthal; paleontology; Pleistocene; skull; taxonomy; tooth; Bavaria; Germany; Haifa [Israel]; Israel; Kebara Cave; Steinheim Basin; Homo sapiens neanderthalensis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875225022

It allows us to exhibit highly sophisticated cognitive and behavioral abilities. Therefore, our brain's size and morphology are defining features of our species and our fossil ancestors and relatives. Endocasts, i. e., internal casts of the bony braincase, provide evidence about brain size and morphology in fossils. Based on endocasts, we know that our ancestors' brains increased overall in size and underwent several reorganizational changes. However, it is difficult to relate evolutionary changes of size and shape of endocasts to evolutionary changes of cognition and behavior. We argue here that an understanding of the tempo and mode of brain development can help to interpret the evolution of our brain and the associated cognitive and behavioral changes. To do so, we review structural brain development, cognitive development, and ontogenetic changes of endocranial size and shape in living individuals on the one hand, and ontogenetic patterns (size increase and shape change) in fossil hominins and their evolutionary change on the other hand. Tightly integrating our knowledge on these different levels will be the key of future work on the evolution of human brain development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cognitive development; Endocast; Hominin; Ontogeny","Primates",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859155458

This new reconstruction corrects defects found in earlier reconstruction attempts by repositioning misaligned cranial fragments, addressing the problem of asymmetry caused by pressure during the fossilization process, and placing the basioccipital in its proper anatomical position. Metric comparisons between Le Moustier 1 and juvenile and adult Neandertals demonstrate that facial height proceeded at a faster rate of growth than facial prognathism at the beginning of the adolescent period. They also confirm the anterior placement of the basioccipital. A compound painted to match the colour of the fossilized bone was used in previous reconstruction attempts and the aim of this analysis was to remove the false material to reveal to what extent the fossilized bone was preserved. The areas with the most artificial material and glue include the palate, areas around the mandibular teeth, the left frontal, and parts of the right parietal and temporal bones. The μCT data were also used to examine internal structures of the skull including the frontal sinus and the labyrinth of the inner ear. An investigation of the frontal sinus reveals morphology similar to that found in adult Neandertals, although the structure does not extend to mid-orbit. The dimension of the radius of curvature of the lateral semicircular canal falls within one standard deviation, and the anterior and posterior canals within two standard deviations, of the published Neandertal mean. As in other Neandertals, the posterior semicircular canal is in an inferior position relative to the plane of the lateral canal.","3-D micro computed tomography; 3-D-reconstruction; Bony labyrinth; Frontal sinus morphology; Neandertals","morphology; Neanderthal; skull; tomography; Animalia; Hominidae; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032458562

This has led to the hypothesis that the prenatal environment (as studied through the second-to-fourth digit ratio, 2D: 4D) is not only associated with robust adult male faces that are perceived as dominant and masculine, but also that there is an activational step during puberty. To test the latter, we collected digit ratios and frontal photographs of right-handed Caucasian boys (aged 4–11 years) along with age, body height and body weight. Using geometric morphometrics, we show a significant relationship between facial shape and 2D: 4D before the onset of puberty (explaining 14.5% of shape variation; p = 0.014 after 10 000 permutations, n = 17). Regression analyses depict the same shape patterns as in adults, namely that the lower the 2D: 4D, the smaller and shorter the forehead, the thicker the eyebrows, the wider and shorter the nose, and the larger the lower face. Our findings add to previous evidence that certain adult male facial characteristics that elicit attributions of masculinity and dominance are determined very early in ontogeny.

Some hypotheses propose that it is an adaptation to specific loads occurring during masticatory function. This study uses finite element analysis to examine these symphyseal loads in a model of a modern human mandible. By modifying the symphyseal cross-sectional form, the mechanical significance of the presence of the chin and symphyseal orientation is tested, and modern human and Neanderthal symphyseal cross-sections are compared with regard to their ability to withstand different loads. The results show that changes in symphyseal form have profound effects on the strains. The presence of a chin leads to lower symphyseal strains overall, whereas a vertical orientation of the symphysis results in higher strains under wishboning, but not under vertical bending in the coronal plane and dorsoventral shear. Compared to Neanderthals, the modern human symphysis shows higher strains during dorsoventral shear and wishboning, but is as effective as the Neanderthal symphysis in resisting vertical bending in the coronal plane and the loads resulting from simulated incision and unilateral molar biting. In general, the results of this study corroborate prior hypotheses about the mechanical effects of the human chin and vertical symphyseal orientation and support the idea that the relative importance of wishboning and vertical bending in the coronal plane might have played a role in the evolution of modern human symphyseal morphology. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biomechanics; Chin; Finite element analysis; Mandible; Neanderthals","article; chin; dentition; finite element analysis; mandible; mastication; Animals; Biomechanics; Chin; Finite Element Analysis; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Mastication; Models, Biological; Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed; Weight-Bearing",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952773335

Averages of images and measurements of brains with these disorders are quantitatively different from normal, and the cerebellum is one of the structures at which differences are typically noted. The present article extends these techniques to a simple, practical, and enlightening detection rule for fetal alcohol damage in adolescents and adults known to have been heavily exposed. The data arise from 180 clinical MR brain images (half of adolescents, half of adults; half male, half female; one-third each fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, and unexposed). The 180 cerebellums were represented by 328-semilandmark triangulations covering most of the cerebellar surface. Statistical analysis exploited the now-conventional methods of Procrustes analysis in three dimensions, along with a recent extension to incorporate size information explicitly. If we reduce the data complexity even further, to just 23 points along the silhouette of the cerebellum as viewed from above along the aqueductal axis, the analysis becomes more precise. Now a single multivariate summary score, very strongly correlated with size, supports a discrimination (diagnosed vs. unexposed) with about 75% accuracy. About one-quarter of our FASD sample overlaps with the central range of the unexposed in the distribution of this size-based score, with the other three-quarters distinctly showing cerebellar damage. The finding, which corresponds quite closely to the fundamental finding of cerebellar hypoplasia in animal experiments, bears implications for fetal alcohol epidemiology, for geometric morphometrics, and for the geometric complexity of useful data structures derived from clinical brain imaging. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Birth defects; Cerebellum; Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical image analysis; Morphometrics","alcohol; allometry; article; biometry; birth defect; brain development; cerebellum; computer program; fetal alcohol syndrome; fetus; human; morphometrics; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prenatal exposure; priority journal; statistical analysis; teratology; three dimensional imaging; Adolescent; Adult; Anthropometry; Cerebellum; Discriminant Analysis; Ethanol; Female; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Pregnancy",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748929268

Bookstein examines the way ordinary arithmetic and numerical patterns are translated into scientific understanding, showing how the process relies on two carefully managed forms of argument: Abduction: the generation of new hypotheses to accord with findings that were surprising on previous hypotheses, and Consilience: the confirmation of numerical pattern claims by analogous findings at other levels of measurement. These profound principles include an understanding of the role of arithmetic and, more importantly, of how numerical patterns found in one study can relate to numbers found in others. They are illustrated through numerous classic and contemporary examples arising in disciplines ranging from atomic physics through geosciences to social psychology. The author goes on to teach core techniques of pattern analysis, including regression and correlation, normal distributions, and inference, and shows how these accord with abduction and consilience, first in the simple setting of one dependent variable and then in studies of image data for complex or interdependent systems. More than 200 figures and diagrams illuminate the text. The book can be read with profit by any student of the empirical nature or social sciences and by anyone concerned with how scientists persuade those of us who are not scientists why we should credit the most important claims about scientific facts or theories. © Fred L.

Although conventional methods for acquiring such data have generally involved invasive preparation of the specimen, particularly in the case of fossils, new tomographic technologies afford nondestructive access to these internal morphologies. In this study we used high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT) to scan a skull of the extant Tursiops truncatus (Cetacea: Odontoceti). We processed the data to reveal the cranial endocast and details of internal skeletal architecture (data at www.digimorph.org). Major features that can be discerned include aspects of the specimen's hypertrophied retia mirabilia, the major canals and openings of the cranial cavity, and the relationship of the brain and endocranial circulatory structures to the surrounding skeleton. CT data also provide information on the shape of the brain that may be lost in conventional anatomical preparations, and readily provide volumetric and linear measurements of the endocast and its individual segments. These results demonstrate the utility of HRXCT for interpreting the internal cranial anatomy of both extant and fossil cetaceans. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Computed tomography; Endocast; Tursiops","Cetacea; Odontoceti; Tursiops; Tursiops truncatus",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-28844506348

Human brain evolution can be addressed through direct evidence provided by fossil hominid endocasts (i.e. paleoneurology), or through indirect evidence of extant species comparative neurology. Here we use the second approach, providing an extant comparative framework for hominid paleoneurological studies. We explore endocranial size and shape differences among great apes and humans, as well as between sexes. We virtually extracted 72 endocasts, sampling all extant great ape species and modern humans, and digitized 37 landmarks on each for 3D generalized Procrustes analysis. All species can be differentiated by their endocranial shape. Among great apes, endocranial shapes vary from short (orangutans) to long (gorillas), perhaps in relation to different facial orientations. Endocranial shape differences among African apes are partly allometric. Major endocranial traits distinguishing humans from great apes are endocranial globularity, reflecting neurological reorganization, and features linked to structural responses to posture and bipedal locomotion. Human endocasts are also characterized by posterior location of foramina rotunda relative to optic canals, which could be correlated to lesser subnasal prognathism compared to living great apes. Species with larger brains (gorillas and humans) display greater sexual dimorphism in endocranial size, while sexual dimorphism in endocranial shape is restricted to gorillas, differences between males and females being at least partly due to allometry. Our study of endocranial variations in extant great apes and humans provides a new comparative dataset for studies of fossil hominid endocasts. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","brain; comparative anatomy; endocast; evolution; hominoids","anatomical variation; animal experiment; ape; article; brain interventricular foramen; brain size; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; female; gorilla; human; intermethod comparison; male; nonhuman; normal human; orang utan; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; sex difference; three dimensional imaging; Analysis of Variance; Anatomy, Comparative; Animals; Brain; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Factual; Female; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Models, Statistical; Organ Size; Principal Component Analysis; Sex Characteristics; Skull; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956212982

A physical reconstruction of the cranium was carried out by Tobias in 1967, who did not discuss problems related to deformation, although he noted a slight functional asymmetry. Nevertheless, the reconstructed cranium shows some anomalies, mainly due to the right skewed position of the upper calvariofacial fragment and uncertainty of the relative position of the neurocranium to the face, which hamper further quantitative analysis of OH5's cranial geometry. Here, we present a complete virtual reconstruction of OH5, using three-dimensional (3D) digital data, geometric morphometric (GM) methods and computer-aided design (CAD) techniques. Starting from a CT scan of Tobias's reconstruction, a semi-automatic segmentation method was used to remove Tobias's plaster. The upper calvariofacial fragment was separated from the lower facial fragment and re-aligned using superposition of their independent midsagittal planes in a range of feasible positions. The missing parts of the right hemiface were reconstructed using non-uniform rational basis-spline (NURBS) surface and subsequently mirrored using the midsagittal plane to arrive at a symmetrical facial reconstruction. A symmetric neurocranium was obtained as the average of the original shape and its mirrored version. The alignment between the two symmetric shapes (face and neurocranium) used their independent midsagittal plane and a reference shape (KNM-ER 406) to highly reduce their degrees of freedom. From the series of alternative reconstructions, we selected the middle of this rather small feasible range. When reconstructed as a range in this way, the whole cranial form of this unique specimen can be further quantified by comparative coordinate-based methods such as GM or can be used for finite element modeling (FEM) explorations of hypotheses about the mechanics of early hominin feeding and diets. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Computer-aided design; Fossil reconstruction; Geometric morphometrics; Paranthropus boisei; Virtual anthropology","anthropology; cranium; fossil assemblage; hominid; morphometry; quantitative analysis; segmentation; Paranthropus boisei",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956153840

Central to this argument is the form of the second pedal digit. Extant strepsirrhines and tarsiers possess a grooming claw on this digit, while most anthropoids have a nail. While controversial, the possible presence of a nail in certain European adapiforms has been considered evidence for anthropoid affinities. Skeletons preserved well enough to test this idea have been lacking for North American adapiforms. Here, we document and quantitatively analyze, for the first time, a dentally associated skeleton of Notharctus tenebrosus from the early Eocene of Wyoming that preserves the complete bones of digit II in semi-articulation. Utilizing twelve shape variables, we compare the distal phalanges of Notharctus tenebrosus to those of extant primates that bear nails (n = 21), tegulae (n = 4), and grooming claws (n = 10), and those of non-primates that bear claws (n = 7). Quantitative analyses demonstrate that Notharctus tenebrosus possessed a grooming claw with a surprisingly well-developed apical tuft on its second pedal digit. The presence of a wide apical tuft on the pedal digit II of Notharctus tenebrosus may reflect intermediate morphology between a typical grooming claw and a nail, which is consistent with the recent hypothesis that loss of a grooming claw occurred in a clade containing adapiforms (e.g. Darwinius masillae) and anthropoids. However, a cladistic analysis including newly documented morphologies and thorough representation of characters acknowledged to have states constituting strepsirrhine, haplorhine, and anthropoid synapomorphies groups Notharctus tenebrosus and Darwinius masillae with extant strepsirrhines rather than haplorhines suggesting that the form of pedal digit II reflects substantial homoplasy during the course of early primate evolution. © 2012 Maiolino et al.",,"animal structures; article; Darwinius masillae; Eocene; fossil animal; grooming claw; morphology; nail; nonhuman; Notharctus tenebrosus; phalanx; primate; quantitative analysis; simian; taxonomy; tegulae; United States; analysis of variance; animal; evolution; fossil; grooming; Haplorhini; histology; hoof and claw; North America; phylogeny; physiology; principal component analysis; species extinction; toe phalanx; Adapiformes; Primates; Simiiformes; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Biological Evolution; Extinction, Biological; Fossils; Grooming; Haplorhini; Hoof and Claw; North America; Phylogeny; Principal Component Analysis; Toe Phalanges",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855599546

Because the growth of the craniofacial skeleton is strongly influenced by mechanical functioning, these methods have potential in investigating the normal and abnormal development of the skull: loading history during development can be predicted and bony adaptations to these loads simulated. Thus these methods can be used to predict the impact of altered loading or modifications of skull form early in ontogeny on the subsequent development of structures. Combining functional models with geometric morphometric methods (GMM), which are principally concerned with the study of variations of form, offers the opportunity to examine variations in form during development and the covariations between form and factors such as functional performance. Such a combination of functional models and GMM can potentially be applied in many useful ways, for example: to build and modify functional models, to assess the outcomes of remodelling studies by comparing the results with morphological changes during ontogeny, and to compare the outcomes of finite element analyses within a multivariate framework. Studies using these tools can not only investigate the development of the skull but also the mechanical processes and thus to some degree, behaviours underlying the development of variation among extant and fossil skeletal elements. By bringing together these tools from quite different comparative traditions, a novel and potentially powerful framework for simulation and statistical biomechanical analyses of form and function emerges. This paper reviews these recent developments in the context of the evolutionary and functional influences on skull development. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Biomechanics; Finite element analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Multibody dynamics analysis",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870789929

The partial cranium (about 2.5 million years old) is filled with stone matrix. The frontal part of the endocranium and most of the face are missing. Based on medical imaging techniques (computed tomography), we aimed to create virtual 3-dimensional reconstructions separately for the ectocranium and endocranium, reconstruct missing parts based on intraspecific comparison, estimate the endocranial capacity and describe endocranial morphological details that were physically inaccessible before. Methods: We mapped fossilized bone as distinct from stone matrix for every slice of the computed tomographic image, creating virtual endocasts. The missing endocranial parts were reconstructed, using thin-plate spline warping, from a reference specimen (STS 5, a complete A. africanus cranium). In contrast with previous studies, a large number of landmarks (8 anatomical and 455 semi-landmarks) were used for this reproducible reconstruction. Results: The endocranial capacity of the original partial cranium is 382 cm3, and the estimated volume for the reconstructed braincase is 440 cm3. On the left side of the endocast, signs of the meningeal vessel system could be detected. Transverse and sigmoid venous sinuses are present in MLD 37/38, whereas an occipital-marginal sinus system could not be found. Conclusions: The reconstructed endocranial capacity of MLD 37/38 lies within the range of other A. africanus specimens (428-515 cm3). In its dimensions, the endocast is similar to that of STS 5. The patterning of detected meningeal arterial branches resembles that of modern humans. The absence of an enlarged occipital-marginal sinus system is typical of A. africanus.",,"animal tissue; conference paper; diagnostic imaging; digital computer; hominid; image analysis; image reconstruction; measurement; nonhuman; paleoanthropology; paleopathology; skeleton; technique; three dimensional imaging; tissue slice; Animals; Cephalometry; Fossils; Haplorhini; History, Ancient; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Paleontology; Skull; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-5444242216

The skull from Hofmeyr, South Africa, which has been dated to c. 36. ka, is one of the only specimens known from this critical part of the late Pleistocene. The Hofmeyr skull was largely intact at the time of its discovery but has suffered post-recovery mishandling, with the resultant loss of most of the lower facial skeleton, the mandibular angle, the right mastoid process, and much of the occipital. Given the potential significance of this specimen, we have undertaken its restoration and reconstruction so as to provide a more complete picture of the cranial morphology of the late Pleistocene population from which it derived. On the basis of photographs, measurements, and morphological description recorded prior to its having been damaged, we reconstructed some of the missing bone in modeling clay on a high resolution plastic cast of the cranium. The original specimen was CT scanned, as was the cast with the reconstructed maxilla and mastoid; these scans were employed in the final computer reconstruction of the skull. Virtual reconstruction of the remainder of the cranium was accomplished using mirror-imaging and reference-based methods, employing 3D geometric morphometrics from a sample of recent human crania to compute coordinate-based estimates of the missing parts. This reconstruction provides a more complete picture of the Hofmeyr cranium and serves as a basis for more comprehensive morphometric comparisons. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Clay modeling; Cranial capacity; Craniometry; Cranium; CT scan; Geometric morphometrics; Mandible; Semilandmarks; Thin-plate spline; Virtual reconstruction","hominid; human evolution; morphology; paleontology; Pleistocene; reconstruction; skeletal remains; skull; three-dimensional modeling; Eastern Cape; Hofmeyr; South Africa; Crania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954214835

However, high quality ontogenetic data are scarce, especially for nonhuman primates. Here, we provide original data derived from an osteological collection of a wild population of Pan troglodytes verus from the Taï Forest National Park, Ivory Coast. This sample is unique, because age, sex, and pedigree information are available for many specimens from behavioral observations in the wild. We scanned crania of all 30 immature specimens and 13 adult individuals using high-resolution computed tomography. We then created virtual casts of the bony braincase (endocasts) to measure EVs. We also measured cranial length, width, and height and attempted to relate cranial distances to EV via regression analysis. Our data are consistent with previous studies. The only neonate in the sample has an EV of 127 cm 3 or 34% of the adult mean. EV increases rapidly during early ontogeny. The average adult EV in this sample is 378.7 ± 30.1 cm 3. We found sexual dimorphism in adults; males seem to be already larger than females before adult EV is attained. Regressions on cranial width and multiple regression provide better estimates for EV than regressions on cranial length or height. Increasing the sample size and compiling more high quality ontogenetic data of EV will help to reconcile ongoing discussions about the evolution of hominin brain growth.

Using CT-based 3D reconstruction, the virtually cleaned endocranial surface allowed for the assessment of more than 30 metrical and nonmetrical features, most of which are considered of phylogenetic importance. The VOXEL-MAN program used was most valuable in describing and analyzing the morphological conditions. Since many of the features have not been widely or virtually studied, a small sample of late Pleistocene/early Holocene skulls from East Africa was similarly analyzed for insight into recent variation. The comparisons between Eliye Springs and the modern African specimens showed that the endocranial morphology of this probably later Middle Pleistocene hominid falls into, or close to, the modern ranges of variation for most features. This study also addresses the problems of variation and phylogenetic significance of many of the features, and highlights the need for basic studies on the variability and relevance of such endocranial traits in human evolution. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Archaic Homo sapiens; Endocranium; Paleoanthropology; Virtual reconstruction","article; computer assisted tomography; computer program; dura mater; evolution; holocene; hominid; human; human tissue; imaging system; Kenya; paleoanthropology; phylogeny; pleistocene; priority journal; skull; three dimensional imaging; virtual reality; Animals; Anthropometry; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Kenya; Phylogeny; Skull; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Hominidae; Homo sapiens",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17544384882

Similar technical challenges are present in paleoanthropology when considering fragmented and deformed mandibular and maxillary fossils. Sts 52, an Australopithecus africanus specimen from Sterkfontein Member 4, represents a typical case where the original shape of the dental arches is no longer preserved. It includes a partial lower face (Sts 52a) and a fragmented mandible (Sts 52b), both incomplete and damaged to such an extent to thwart attempts at matching upper and lower dentitions. We show how the preserved macrowear pattern of the tooth crowns can be used to functionally reconstruct Sts 52's dental arches. High-resolutiondental stone casts of Sts 52 maxillary and mandibular dentition were mounted and repositioned in a dental articulator. The occlusal relationship between antagonists was restored based on the analysis of the occlusal wear pattern of each preserved tooth, considering all dental contact movements represented in the occlusal compass. The reconstructed dental arches were three-dimensional surface scanned and their occlusal kinematics tested in a simulation. The outcome of this contribution is the first functional restoration of A. africanus dental arches providing new morphometric data for specimen Sts 52.

Among these, morphometric quantitative techniques for reconstruction are increasingly common. Here we compare the accuracy of three approaches - mean substitution, thin plate splines, and multiple linear regression - for estimating missing landmarks of damaged fossil specimens. Comparisons are made varying the number of missing landmarks, sample sizes, and the reference species of the population used to perform the estimation. The testing is performed on landmark data from individuals of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla, and nine hominin fossil specimens. Results suggest that when a small, same-species fossil reference sample is available to guide reconstructions, thin plate spline approaches perform best. However, if no such sample is available (or if the species of the damaged individual is uncertain), estimates of missing morphology based on a single individual (or even a small sample) of close taxonomic affinity are less accurate than those based on a large sample of individuals drawn from more distantly related extant populations using a technique (such as a regression method) able to leverage the information (e.g., variation/covariation patterning) contained in this large sample. Thin plate splines also show an unexpectedly large amount of error in estimating landmarks, especially over large areas.

Gorganovic-Kramberger on Neandertal remains from Krapina, Croatia, was published in 1906, only 11 years after Röntgen announced the discovery of X-rays. Many subsequent studies on fossil hominids used regular clinical diagnostic radiological apparatus, as depicted in Atlas of Radiographs of Early Man by M.F. Skinner and G.H. Sperber (1982). Some specimens such as crania filled with heavily calcified matrix proved intractable. Ordinary radiographs of such specimens usually failed to reveal endocranial structure, as fossilized bone and calcified endocast were approximately equally radio-opaque. Thus, neither endocranial volume nor structural details were detectable. The only invasive method that could have been employed involved mechanical removal of the solid matrix, but this entailed hazards to the cranial vault and the destruction of the natural endocranial cast. In 1983-1984, G.C. Conroy and M. Vannier utilized recent advances in high-resolution computed tomography to produce non-invasive, intracranial capacity measurements of matrix-filled fossil skulls. They tried the method on two fossil mammal skulls filled with hard sandstone matrix (1984. Science 26:456-458), and then successfully applied it to a South African, matrix-filled cranium of the ancient hominid (hominin) species. Australopithecus africanus from Makapansgat (Conroy et al. 1990, Science 247:838-841). Details of the morphology of the endocranial surface of the braincase were revealed, including the pattern of venous sinus drainage in the posterior cranial fossa. A group based in St. Louis, Vienna, Paris, Rome, and Johannesburg has taken such studies further. Beautiful ""virtual endocasts"" have been produced on a large male specimen of A. africanus from Sterkfontein. South Africa, and the endocranial capacity has been determined (1998). The methods make it possible to re-create ""virtual endocasts"" of ancient hominids. © 2001 Wiley-Liss.

Both profit from collaborative work and diffusion of know-how. The last two decades have seen a technical revolution in biological anthropology: Virtual Anthropology (VA). It exploits digital technologies and brings together experts from different domains. Using volume and surface data from scanning processes, VA allows applying advanced shape and form analysis, higher reproducibility, offers permanent availability of virtual objects, and easy data exchange. The six main areas of VA including digitisation, exposing hidden structures, comparing shapes and forms, reconstructing specimens, materialising electronic specimens, and sharing data are introduced in this paper. Many overlaps with archaeological problems are highlighted and potential application areas are emphasised.

FEA is used to test mechanical hypotheses in functional anatomy and VA complements and augments this process by virtue of its tools for acquiring data, for segmenting and preparing virtual specimens, and for generating reconstructions and artificial forms. This represents a critical methodological advance because geometry is one of the crucial inputs of FEA and is often the variable of interest in functional anatomy. However, we currently lack tools that quantitatively relate differences in geometry to differences in stress and strain, or that evaluate the impact on FEA of variation within and between biological samples. Thus, when comparing models of different geometry, we do not currently obtain sufficiently informative answers to questions such as ""How different are these models, and in what manner are they different? Are they different in some anatomical regions but not others?"" New methodologies must be developed in order to maximize the potential of FEA to address questions in comparative and evolutionary biology. In this paper we review these and other important issues that were raised during our Vienna meeting. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomechanics; Finite Element Analysis; Geometry; Morphometrics; Virtual Anthropology","Anatomical regions; Biological samples; Different geometry; Evolutionary biology; Finite element analysis; Morphometrics; Stress and strain; Virtual Anthropology; Biomechanics; Biophysics; Geometry; Finite element method; anthropology; biomechanics; comparative anatomy; computer simulation; craniofacial morphology; finite element analysis; functional anatomy; information processing; mathematical computing; mechanical stress; morphometrics; priority journal; short survey; stress strain relationship; virtual anthropology; virtual reality; Animals; Anthropology; Biological Evolution; Biomechanics; Brain; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Finite Element Analysis; Hominidae; Humans; Macaca; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological",Short Survey,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955473225

Among the specific techniques are spiral computed tomography and 3-dimensional reconstructions, which include stereolithographic and fused deposition modeling of volume data sets. The Iceman's skull was the first to be produced using stereolithography; subsequently, it has been successfully applied in preoperative planning. With the advent of high-end performance graphics workstations and biomedical image processing software packages, 3-dimensional reconstructions have become established as routine tools for analyzing volume data sets. These techniques enabled dramatically new insights to be gained in the field of physical anthropology. Computed tomography became the ideal research tool to access the internal structures of various precious fossils without even touching - let alone damaging - them. Among the most precious are specimens from the genus Australopithecus (1.8 Myr-3.5 Myr), as well as representatives of Homo heidelbergensis (200 kyr-600 kyr) and Homo neanderthalensis (40 kyr-100 kyr); such fossils have been CT-scanned during the last five years. The fossils often are filled with a stone matrix or other encrustations. During the post-processing routines, highly advanced algorithms were used to remove these encrustations virtually (the concrete fossils remain untouched). Thus it has been possible to visualize the morphological structures that are hidden by the matrix layer. Some specimens have been partially destroyed, but it has been possible for the missing parts were reconstructed on the computer screen in order to get estimations of brain volume and endocranial morphology, both major fields of interest in physical anthropology. Moreover, the data in computerized form allows new descriptions of morphological structures using geometric morphometrics. Some of the results may change aspects and interpretations in human evolution and approaches to long-standing questions in this field.

Yet, possible confounding effects of familiarity with the car models, media coverage and entertainment could not be ruled out. In order to address this, the current study uses a cross-cultural comparison. Adult subjects in two countries (Austria and Ethiopia, n=129) were asked to rate person characteristics of 46 standardized front views of automobiles on various trait scales. These two countries differ substantially with regard to their experience with car models and brands, as well as car marketing and media coverage. Geometric morphometrics was then used to assess the shape information underlying trait attribution. Car shapes for perceived maturity, maleness and dominance were highly similar in both countries, with patterns comparable to shape changes during facial growth in humans: Relative sizes of the forehead and windshield decrease with age/growth, eyes and headlights both become more slit-like, noses and grilles bigger, lips and air-intakes are wider. Austrian participants further attributed various degrees of some interpersonal attitudes and emotions, whereas neither Austrians nor Ethiopians congruently ascribed personalities. Morphological correlates of personal characteristics are discussed, as are person perception and its overgeneralization to inanimate objects. Cross-cultural similarities and differences are addressed, as well as implications for car styling, follow-up studies on driving and pedestrian behavior, and fundamental dimensions in inference from (human) faces. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Behavioral anthropology; Cross-cultural overgeneralization; Facial shape; Geometric morphometrics",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857033307

Later, he sent several more specimens including a subadult skull that was described by Lorenz von Liburnau in 1902. In 2003, some of us excavated at the locality and found more specimens belonging to this species, including much of a subadult skeleton. Two frontal fragments were found, and these, together with most of the postcranial bones, belong to the skull. CT scans of the skull and other jaw fragments were made in Vienna and those of the frontal fragments at Penn State University. The two fragments have been reunited with the skull in silico, and broken parts from one side of the skull have been replaced virtually by mirror-imaged complete parts from the other side. The parts of the jaw of another individual of a slightly younger dental age have also been reconstructed virtually from CT scans with mirror imaging and by using the maxillary teeth and temporomandibular joints as a guide to finish the reconstruction. Apart from forming a virtual skull for biomechanical and systematic analysis, we were also able to make a virtual endocast. Missing anterior pieces were reconstructed by using part of an endocast of the related Archaeolemur majori. The volume is 115 ml.

Increasingly, morphological studies of museum specimens are using X-ray computed tomography to visualize internal morphology, because of its 'non-destructive' nature. However, it is not known whether CT can fragment the size of DNA extracted from museum specimens, as has been demonstrated to occur in living cells. This question is of paramount importance for collections based research because X-rays may reduce the amount of data obtainable from specimens. In our study, we tested whether exposure of museum bird skins to typical CT X-ray energies (for visualization of the skeleton) increased DNA strand fragmentation, a key factor for the success of downstream molecular applications. For the present study, we extracted DNA from shavings of 24 prepared and dried bird skins (100 + years) footpads before and after CT scanning. The pre- and post-CT fragmentation profiles were assessed using a capillary electrophoresis high-precision instrument (Agilent Bioanalyzer). Comparison of the most common strand length in each DNA sample (relative mass) revealed no significant difference unexposed and exposed tissue (paired t-test p=0.463). In conclusion, we found no further quantifiable degradation of DNA strand length under standard X-ray exposure obtained from our bird skins sample. Differences in museum preservation techniques probably had a greater effect on variation of pre-CT DNA fragmentation. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","DNA fragmentation; Micro-CT; Museum skin DNA; PCR; X-ray microtomography","biodegradation; bird; cell organelle; DNA; fragmentation; genetic analysis; molecular analysis; morphology; phylogenetics; polymerase chain reaction; reconstruction; taxonomy; X-ray; Animalia; Aves",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863550032

Because this region is typically lodged deep within the skull, there have been few morphological studies of the bony labyrinth in fossils-where it frequently is completely enveloped by surrounding bone and sediment matrix. The recent development of high-resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scanning provides a powerful new tool for investigating such tiny, often inaccessible structures. Here we introduce a protocol for producing three-dimensional (3-D) virtual visualizations of the bony labyrinth from high-resolution CT images. As a case study, we scanned the skull of a basal platyrrhine primate, Chilecebus carrascoensis, using the high-resolution CT facility at Pennsylvania State University, reconstructing the endocast of the bony labyrinth from the resulting data. Segmenting the original CT images is a vital step in producing accurate 3-D virtual reconstructions. We failed in efforts to isolate the bony labyrinth endocast through automated means, owing to the similar densities of the matrix filling the sinuses and spongy bone cavities of the specimen, and the bony labyrinth itself. Differing density contrasts across the fossil/matrix interface and overlapping grayscales of the fossil and matrix, required Half Maximum Height thresholds to be measured dynamically. Multiple thresholds are advantageous for processing the CT data of fossils that are inherently heterogeneous in material properties and densities. The iterative interaction between an operator and a computer offers the only means presently available for reliably discriminating the endocast of the bony labyrinth from the remainder of the specimen. © Palaeontological Association May 2012.","Bony labyrinth; Chilecebus; High-resolution X-ray CT; Platyrrhine primate; Segmentation; Three-dimensional (3-D) virtual reconstruction","bone; fossil; mammal; morphology; reconstruction; segmentation; skull; tomography; visualization; X-ray; Mammalia; Primates",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879143645

Because the endocranial cavity is filled with hard stone matrix, earlier studies focused only on the exterior morphology of the specimen using the traditional methods. In order to derive more information for the phyletic evaluation of the Liujiang cranium, high-resolution industrial computed tomography (CT) was used to scan the fossil, and the three-dimensional (3D) brain image was reconstructed. Compared with the endocasts of the hominin fossils (Hexian, Zhoukoudian, KNM-WT 15000, Sm 3, Kabwe, Brunn 3, Predmost) and modern Chinese, most morphological features of the Liujiang brain are in common with modern humans, including a round brain shape, bulged and wide frontal lobes, an enlarged brain height, a full orbital margin and long parietal lobes. A few differences exist between Liujiang and the modern Chinese in our sample, including a strong posterior projection of the occipital lobes, and a reduced cerebellar lobe. The measurement of the virtual endocast shows that the endocranial capacity of Liujiang is 1567 cc, which is in the range of Late Homo sapiens and much beyond the mean of modern humans.

Unfortunately, temporal trepanation may result in significant brain damage through herniation of the cerebrum at the edges of the trepanation openings. In one case of a 26-year-old male with severe head injury, a circular posterior-hinged craniotomy (CPHC) was performed after an ineffective unitemporal trepanation for evacuation of an acute subdural hematoma. This ultimately successful operation prompted experimental and morphologic investigations on a new surgical procedure for lowering intracranial pressure (ICP). In 12 of 15 human cadavers, an experimentally ICP was lowered by a CPHC with between 9-21 mm of frontal elevation of the calvaria. Using computer simulation, the frontal elevations of the calvaria were ""virtually"" performed on 3D reconstructions from CT scans of skulls, and the intracranial volume gained was measured with a computer software program. The volume increase of the cranial cavity showed a relatively constant relation to the cranial capacity and was increased by 6.0% (±0.4%) or 78 cm3 with a 10 mm elevation and by 12.4% (±0.7%) or 160 cm3 with a 20 mm elevation. There were no significant differences with skulls of different ages or ethnic origin; however, a significant effect of gender (F = 7.074; P ≤ 0.013) on the gained volume in percent of the cranial capacity for the 20 mm elevation was observed. This difference can be explained by the inverse relationship between volume increase and cranial capacity (r = -0.507; P ≤ 0.004). © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Brain edema; Circular craniotomy; Endocasts; Intracranial pressure","mannitol; adult; aged; article; blood pressure regulation; brain edema; brain hernia; cadaver; craniotomy; female; human; hyperventilation; hypothermia; intracranial pressure; male; priority journal; sedation; subdural hematoma; surgical technique; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Edema; Cadaver; Computer Simulation; Craniotomy; Female; Head Injuries, Closed; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Intracranial Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Anatomic; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036242367

Because bone adapts nonuniformly, physical activity may make an important independent structural contribution to bone strength that is independent of bone mass and density. Our objective was to create and validate methods for subject-specific finite element (FE) model generation that would accurately predict the surface strains experienced by the distal radius during an in vivo loading task, and to apply these methods to a group of 23 women aged 23-35 to examine variations in strain, bone mass and density, and physical activity. Four cadaveric specimens were experimentally tested and specimen-specific FE models were developed to accurately predict periosteal surface strains (root mean square error=16.3%). In the living subjects, when 300N load was simulated, mean strains were significantly inversely correlated with BMC (r=-0.893), BMD (r=-0.892) and physical activity level (r=-0.470). Although the group of subjects was relatively homogenous, BMD varied by two-fold (range: 0.19-0.40g/cm3) and mean energy-equivalent strain varied by almost six-fold (range: 226.79-1328.41με) with a simulated 300N load. In summary, we have validated methods for estimating surface strains in the distal radius that occur while leaning onto the palm of the hand. In our subjects, strain varied widely across individuals, and was inversely related to bone parameters that can be measured using clinical CT, and inversely related to physical activity history. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Bone; Bone adaptation; Cadaver testing; Finite element; Human; Physical activity; Strain gage","Bone; Finite element method; Forecasting; Mean square error; Strain gages; Bone adaptation; Human; Physical activity; Physical activity levels; Root mean square errors; Subject-specific; Surface strains; Validated methods; Strain; adult; aged; article; biomechanics; bone density; bone mass; female; finite element analysis; human; human experiment; human tissue; in vivo study; loading task; mathematical model; normal human; physical activity; prediction; priority journal; radius; surface strain; validation study; very elderly; Bone; Bone adaptation; Cadaver testing; Finite element; Human; Physical activity; Strain gage; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Bone Density; Cadaver; Female; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Models, Biological; Radius; Stress, Mechanical; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Weight-Bearing; Wrist Joint; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905280771

However, the outgroup to Archosauria, Phytosauria, has yet to be studied with modern techniques that would allow reconstruction of their internal anatomy. Pseudopalatus mccauleyi is a derived phytosaur from the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation, Arizona. A skull of P. mccauleyi, USNM 15839, was imaged using computed tomography in order to create the first high-quality, digitally reconstructed phytosaur endocast. Pseudopalatus mccauleyi exhibits overall endocast morphology that is similar to that of an extant crocodylian. These clades, phytosaurs and extant crocodylians, exhibit convergent Baupläne and similar inferred ecologies. A notable difference between the endocasts of the two clades is a considerable dural expansion in P. mccauleyi that denotes a large pineal body. This expansion, and the overall morphology of the endocast, is consistent with the historic endocranial reconstructions of the phytosaurs Pseudopalatus buceros, Smilosuchus gregorii, and Parasuchus hislopi. A comparison with phylogenetically diverse archosaurian endocasts reveals that endocast morphologies are highly conserved within Pseudosuchia, regardless of Bauplan or ecology. This conservatism is in contrast to the diversity of endocast morphology observed within Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, or between members of those clades and Pseudosuchia. The most pronounced variability in pseudosuchian endocast morphology is a trend in size reduction of the pineal region, from a large basal condition to a reduced derived condition wherein the pineal region is indistinguishable from the rest of the endocast. A similar trend in pineal reduction is also seen in theropods and sauropods. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"anatomy; crocodilian; morphology; paleontology; phylogenetics; sensory system; skull",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879637684

The method is considered to be nondestructive; however, researchers using the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility have reported that color changes sometimes occur in teeth during submicron scanning. Using the Advanced Light Source, we tested for color changes during micron-level scanning and for postexposure effects of ultraviolet light. We exposed a 2.0-mm wide strip (band) to synchrotron light in 32 specimens, using multiple energy levels and scan durations. The sample included modern and fossilized teeth and bone. After scanning, the specimens were exposed to fluorescent and direct ultraviolet light. All teeth showed color changes caused by exposure to synchrotron radiation. The resulting color bands varied in intensity but were present even at the lowest energy and shortest duration of exposure. Color bands faded during subsequent exposure to fluorescent and ultraviolet light, but even after extensive ultraviolet exposure, 67% (8/12) of UV-exposed teeth retained some degree of induced color. We found that the hydroxyapatite crystals, rather than the organic component, are the targets of change, and that diagenesis appears to impact color retention. Color changes have significance beyond aesthetics. They are visible indicators of ionization (chemical change) and, therefore, of potential physical damage. It is important for researchers to recognize that synchrotron microtomography may damage specimens, but adopting suitable safeguards and procedures may moderate or eliminate this damage.

Here, we demonstrate the potential for using virtual endocasts (VEs) to examine inter- and intraspecific variation in brain volume in members of the family Hyaenidae. Total endocranial volume (adjusted for body size) and anterior cerebrum volume (adjusted for endocranial volume) were greater in the spotted hyena, the most gregarious of the species, than in the other hyaenids, all of which are less gregarious. An intraspecific analysis of spotted hyenas revealed that anterior cerebrum volume is significantly larger in males than females, although total endocranial volume does not differ between the sexes. Greater total endocranial and anterior cerebrum volume of spotted hyenas, relative to those of other hyena species, may be related to increased neural processing mediating cognitive demands associated with a complex social life. These data demonstrate that computed tomographic (CT) technology can be used to create VEs in species for which actual brains are rare or unavailable, and suggest that this approach can be applied systematically to explore intra- and interspecies brain variations in studies of brain evolution. © 2011 New York Academy of Sciences.","Comparative; Endocast; Frontal cortex; Sociality; Spotted hyena","animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; brain region; brain size; Carnivora; cognition; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; digital imaging; female; image processing; male; nerve cell; neuroimaging; neurologic examination; nonhuman; sex difference; social life; virtual endocast; Crocuta crocuta; Hyaenidae",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956218409

This pilot study aims to deliver a new method that goes beyond mirror imaging, giving the possibility to reconstruct crania characterized by large missing areas, which might be useful in the fields of paleoanthropology, bioarcheology, and forensics. We test the accuracy of digital reconstructions in cases where two-thirds or more of a human cranium were missing. A three-dimensional (3D) virtual model of a human cranium was virtually damaged twice to compare two destruction-reconstruction scenarios. In the first case, a small fraction of the midsagittal region was still preserved, allowing the application of mirror imaging techniques. In the second case, the damage affected the complete midsagittal region, which demands a new approach to estimate the position of the midsagittal plane. Reconstructions were carried out using CT scans from a sample of modern humans (12 males and 13 females), to which 3D digital modeling techniques and geometric morphometric methods were applied. As expected, the second simulation showed a larger variability than the first one, which underlines the fact that the individual midsagittal plane is of course preferable in order to minimize the reconstruction error. However, in both simulations the Procrustes mean shape was an effective reference for the reconstruction of the entire cranium, producing models that showed a remarkably low error of about 3 mm, given the extent of missing data. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Cranial reconstruction; Geometric morphometrics; Mirror imaging; Virtual anthropology","archeology; article; computer assisted tomography; female; forensic science; human; image reconstruction; male; paleoanthropology; priority journal; sex difference; skull; skull defect; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Fossils; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Sex Characteristics; Skull; Young Adult; Crania",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876483898

Here, we assess the morphological features of the virtual endocast of the Cioclovina Upper Paleolithic calvarium, one of the earliest reliably dated European modern human fossils. Our study was conducted on a computed tomography (CT) scan of the original specimen. The endocranial profile was approximated via a semiautomatic segmentation of the CT data. Virtual reconstructions of the endocast were used for assessing the morphological features of the endocranium and for the estimation of the endocranial volume. Cioclovina exhibits a clockwise torque with a small anterior extension of the left frontal lobe over the right one and a protrusion of the right occipital lobe over the left, most likely due to the superior sagittal sinus coursing over the occipital pole. There is an obvious right predominance of the posterior drainage system. Interestingly, the area of the frontal sinus is occupied by dense bony tissue with small air cells corresponding probably to a natural bony loss in the diploë and to vascular spaces. An estimated endocranial volume of 1498.53 cc was calculated. The convolutional details of the third inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's caps) are indistinguishable from those found in modern Homo sapiens, and the left occipital lobe appears wider than the right, a possible correlate of right-handedness. Our metric analysis of endocranial measurements also aligns Cioclovina with modern humans.

A series of studies, using different kinds of fossils, especially those with elongated shape (e.g., elongated gastropods), deal with their orientation and the subsequent reconstruction of the depositional conditions (e.g., paleocurrents and transport mechanisms). However, disk-shaped fossils like planispiral cephalopods or gastropods were used, up to now, with caution for interpreting paleocurrents. Moreover, most studies just deal with the topmost surface of such mass occurrences, due to the easier accessibility. Within this study, a new method for three-dimensional reconstruction of the internal structure of a fossil mass occurrence and the subsequent calculation of its spatial shell orientation is established. A 234 million-years-old (Carnian, Triassic) monospecific mass occurrence of the ammonoid Kasimlarceltites krystyni from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, embedded in limestone, is used for this pilot study. Therefore, a 150×45×140mm3 block of the ammonoid bearing limestone bed has been grinded to 70 slices, with a distance of 2mm between each slice. By using a semi-automatic region growing algorithm of the 3D-visualization software Amira, ammonoids of a part of this mass occurrence were segmented and a 3D-model reconstructed. Landmarks, trigonometric and vector-based calculations were used to compute the diameters and the spatial orientation of each ammonoid. The spatial shell orientation was characterized by dip and dip-direction and aperture direction of the longitudinal axis, as well as by dip and azimuth of an imaginary sagittal-plane through each ammonoid. The exact spatial shell orientation was determined for a sample of 675 ammonoids, and their statistical orientation analyzed (i.e., NW/SE). The study combines classical orientation analysis with modern 3D-visualization techniques, and establishes a novel spatial orientation analyzing method, which can be adapted to any kind of abundant solid matter. © 2013 The Authors.","Amira 3D-software; Destructive 3D-visualization; Mass occurrences; Spatial shell orientation; Stereographic analyses; Triassic ammonoids","3D-visualization; Ammonoids; Depositional condition; Mass occurrences; Orientation analysis; Region growing algorithm; Stereographic analysis; Three-dimensional reconstruction; Deposition; Limestone; Molluscs; Shells (structures); Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Three dimensional; Carnian; computer simulation; crustacean; fossil record; limestone; reconstruction; shell; software; species occurrence; three-dimensional modeling; Triassic; Taurides; Turkey; Ammonoidea; Cephalopoda; Gastropoda",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892516192

African lions live in gregarious prides usually consisting of related adult females, their dependent offspring, and a coalition of immigrant males. Upon reaching maturity, male lions enter a nomadic and often, solitary phase in their lives, whereas females are mainly philopatric and highly social throughout their lives. In contrast, the social life history does not differ between male and female cougars; both are solitary. Three-dimensional virtual endocasts were created using computed tomography from the skulls of 14 adult African lions (8 male, 6 female) and 14 cougars (7 male, 7 female). Endocranial volume and basal skull length were highly correlated in African lions (r = 0.59, p < 0.05) and in cougars (r = 0.67, p < 0.01). Analyses of total endocranial volume relative to skull length revealed no sex differences in either African lions or cougars. However, relative anterior cerebrum volume comprised primarily of frontal cortex and surface area was significantly greater in female African lions than males, while relative posterior cerebrum volume and surface area was greater in males than females. These differences were specific to the neocortex and were not found in the solitary cougar, suggesting that social life history is linked to sex-specific neocortical patterns in these species. We further hypothesize that increased frontal cortical volume in female lions is related to the need for greater inhibitory control in the presence of a dominant male aggressor. Copyright © 2012 S.

It based on a model deformable approach constrained by the knowledge of soft tissues thicknesses, at a certain number of characteristic landmarks. The facial reconstruction process is divided into two main stages. An automatic initialization step of the deformable model is based on a non-linear registration technique guided by B-Splines Free Form Deformations model. In the second step, the initial skin, resulting from the transformation computed previously, is refined by means of a three-dimensional deformable model based on simplexes meshes that is attracted by some characteristic landmarks previously computed by a calculation of Mean and Gaussian curvatures. The evolution of the deformable model is done according to different internal and external forces among which the Gradient Vector Flow force and a balloon force. This method has been tested on thirteen sets of skull/skin data, extracted from 3D-MRI of Image heads of children and adults. © 2012 IEEE.","3D computerized facial reconstruction; 3D deformable model; 3D-MRI; anthropometrical constraints; GVF; simplex meshes; skull","anthropometrical constraints; Deformable models; GVF; Simplex mesh; skull; Deformation; Information science; Magnetic resonance imaging; Signal processing; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868532173

However, endocasts have never been used to investigate how the human brain has evolved since the Neolithic period. We investigated the evolution of the human brain during the Holocene by comparing virtual endocasts from Beiqian site (a Neolithic Chinese site) and a sample of Chinese modern-day humans. Standardized measurements and indices were taken to provide quantification of the overall endocast shape, including the length, breadth, height, frontal breadth, and the ratio of frontal breadth to breadth, as well as the cranial capacity. We found that the height of the endocasts and cranial capacity have decreased between our two samples, whereas the frontal breadth and sexual dimorphism have increased. We argue that these changes can be caused by random genetic mutation and epigenetic change in response to changes in the environment. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, many fossils are difficult to recognize, being encased in a lithified matrix whose tedious removal is required before examination is possible. The authors describe the use of multidetector computed tomography (CT) in locating, identifying, and examining fossil remains of crocodilians (Mesosuchia) embedded in hard shale, all without removing the matrix. In addition, they describe how three-dimensional (3D) reformatted CT images provided details that were helpful for extraction and preparation. Multidetector CT can help experienced paleontologists localize and characterize fossils in the matrix of a promising rock specimen in a nondestructive manner. Moreover, with its capacity to generate highly accurate 3D images, multidetector CT can help determine whether the fossils warrant extraction and can assist in planning the extraction process. Thus, multidetector CT may well become an invaluable tool in the field of paleoradiology. © RSNA.",,"animal; article; bone; computer assisted tomography; crocodilian; fossil; methodology; pilot study; radiography; Alligators and Crocodiles; Animals; Bone and Bones; Fossils; Pilot Projects; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866248416

Longitudinal studies will be greatly facilitated, allowing for a more complete and accurate description of events if in-vivo studies are accomplished. The purpose of the ongoing project is to establish a feasible and reproducible setup for in-vivo mouse lung micro-computed tomography (μCT). We seek to use in-vivo respiratory-gated μCT to follow mouse models of lung disease with subsequent recovery of the mouse. Methodologies for optimizing scanning parameters and gating for the in-vivo mouse lung are presented. A Scireq flexiVent ventilated the gas-anesthetized mice at 60 breaths/minute, 30 cm H20 PEEP, 30 ml/kg tidal volume and provided a respiratory signal to gate a Skyscan 1076 μCT. Physiologic monitoring allowed the control of vital functions and quality of anesthesia, e.g. via ECG monitoring. In contrary to longer exposure times with ex-vivo scans, scan times for in-vivo were reduced using 35μm pixel size, 158ms exposure time and 18μm pixel size, 316ms exposure time to reduce motion artifacts. Gating via spontaneous breathing was also tested. Optimal contrast resolution was achieved at 50kVp, 200μA, applying an aluminum filter (0.5mm). There were minimal non-cardiac related motion artifacts. Both 35μm and 18μm voxel size images were suitable for evaluation of the airway lumen and parenchymal density. Total scan times were 30 and 65 minutes respectively. The mice recovered following scanning protocols. In-vivo lung scanning with recovery of the mouse delivered reasonable image quality for longitudinal studies, e.g. mouse asthma models. After examining 10 mice, we conclude μCT is a feasible tool evaluating mouse models of lung pathology in longitudinal studies with increasing anatomic detail available for evaluation as one moves from in-vivo to ex-vivo studies. Further developments include automated bronchial tree segmentation and airway wall thickness measurement tools. Improvements in Hounsfield unit calibration have to be performed when the interest of the study lies in determining and quantifying parenchymal changes and rely on estimating partial volume contributions of underlying structures to voxel densities.","In-vivo; Micro-CT; Mouse lung; Respiratory gating","Biological organs; Image segmentation; Living systems studies; Medical imaging; Optical resolving power; Optimization; Physiological models; Scanning; In-vivo; Micro-CT; Mouse lung; Respiratory gating; Computerized tomography",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-23844504655

Within the last few years and with the development of new systems we are now able to produce three dimensional models of human faces. The methods and tools for data acquisition, processing, and analysis of 3D shape and form are part of a new interdiscipline: Virtual Anthropology. We are combining several approaches to study sexual dimorphism in human facial morphology and to compare the perfomance and accuracy of different systems producing 3D facial models. With the Breuckmann optoTop-He®, we have a scanning system that is capable of performing three dimensional surface scans of almost every surface in realtime. FaceGen Modeller® and PhotoModeler 2010® on the other hand are software solutions that allow us to produce 3D models of human faces based only on several 2D photographs. The aim of this study is to examine if software using 2D images, although much cheaper than a full scale scanning system, can create 3D models of sufficient accuracy for scientific and other purposes. The results are important for both anthropological and forensic applications. © 2012 Authors.",,"Forensic applications; Morphological approach; Morphological research; Scanning systems; Sexual dimorphism; Software solution; Three-dimensional model; Three-dimensional surface; Animation; Imaging systems; Photography; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879819867

The starting point is the formulation of a Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) snake extended to include statistical shape information. This method exploits the diffusion process used by the GVF snake and improves its capacity to deal with occlusion problems by adding a shape term to the traditional scheme. The results of the segmentation of the MR data are compared with the results of the segmentation of CT scans of the same individual. For the MR data, the addition of a shape term improves on the results obtained by using a GVF snake alone. © The Eurographics Association 2008.",,"Diffusion process; External surfaces; Gradient vector flow; Human skull; Occlusion problems; Statistical shapes; Visible human project; Computer graphics; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878484545
