Materials and methods: The sample comprises 76 adult skulls from five archaeological sites, ranging from 4,500 to 1,530 BP. 3D geometric morphometrics, multivariate statistics, quantitative evolutionary genetic and biodistance analyses were performed to study the diachronic variation in craniofacial morphology. Analyses were performed on two cranial modules: the face and the cranial vault, across three major diachronic groups representing the late Neolithic (LNA), the Bronze Age (BA), and the Han-Jin dynasty (HD). Results: Average regional FST for both cranial modules was low, indicating relatively greater variation within diachronic groups than among them. While the LNA and BA groups did not show any significant differences in facial and vault shape, significant craniofacial shape changes were detected between the BA and HD groups. Discussion: The consistent craniofacial morphology during the LNA and the BA, and the shift in morphology between the BA and the HD indicates that cultural discontinuity does not always coincide with biological discontinuity. The Hehuang population evolved in situ with few changes, despite cultural and dietary changes, until the HD when migrations from the Central Plains are associated with extra-local gene flow to the area. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Diachronic changes in craniofacial morphology among the middle–late Holocene populations from Hehuang region, Northwest China","volume":"169","page start":"55","authors with affiliations":"He, L., Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100044, China, Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100044, China, School of Earth Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, George Mason UniversityVA  22030-4444, United States; Liu, W., Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100044, China, Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100044, China; Temple, D.H., Department of Sociology and Anthropology, George Mason UniversityVA  22030-4444, United States; Wang, M., Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing, 100710, China; Zhang, Q., School of Archaeology, Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, China; von Cramon-Taubadel, N., Buffalo Human Evolutionary Morphology Lab, Department of Anthropology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, 14261, United States","author(s) id":"57207733337;28567979400;18038865200;57207734230;12645364800;23471109300;","index keywords":"archeology; Article; biodistance analysis; Bronze Age; centroid size; China; controlled study; cranial vault; craniofacial morphology; face; female; gene flow; genetic analysis; genetic conservation; geometry; Han Jin dynasty; human; human tissue; male; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Neolithic; prehistoric period; quantitative analysis; sex difference","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"3D geometric morphometrics; Hehuang region; population history; skull morphology","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"He L., Liu W., Temple D.H., Wang M., Zhang Q., von Cramon-Taubadel N.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.23807"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"CRAMPTON J.S.","x":-1198.94873046875,"y":1580.549560546875,"id":"8908","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0029535455","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"2","issue":"2","year":"1995","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0029535455\u0026doi\u003d10.1111%2fj.1502-3931.1995.tb01611.x\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d012aa80c7ba9a17168f73f4f198140cc","affiliations":"Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences, PO Box 30 368, Lower Hutt, New Zealand","source title":"Lethaia","abstract":"Elliptic Fourier shape analysis is a powerful, though under‐utilized, biometric tool that is particularly suited for the description of fossils lacking many homologous landmarks, such as several common bivalve groups. The method is conceptually more parsimonious than more traditional biometric methods based on discrete linear and angular measurements. Most importantly, however, shape analysis captures a much higher proportion of the morphological information resident in any fossil than analyses based on discrete measurements. The number of harmonics required in an elliptic Fourier analysis can be estimated from a series of inverse Fourier reconstructions, or from the power spectrum. In most studies it is appropriate to normalize Fourier coefficients for size, although this information can be reincorporated at a later stage. The coefficients should probably not be standardized, unless there is evidence to suggest that high‐frequency information was genetically as important as low‐frequency information. Depending upon the aims of a particular study and the morphological disparity of the fossils in question, it might be appropriate to eliminate the first harmonic (‘best‐fitting’) ellipse from an analysis. Meaningful comparison of the left and right valves of bivalves requires the digitized coordinates of one or other to be mirrored prior to computation of the Fourier coefficients. □Biometric analysis, Bivalvia, elliptic Fourier analysis, morphometrics.

The overlap of their ecological niches has raised an important debate on the role that carnivores played in archaeological site formation. Different analytical techniques differentiate the action of carnivores and humans and identify the type of carnivore involved of which tooth mark analyses are prominent. However, available taphonomic studies present some limitations given the great overlap among tooth mark sizes from different carnivores, enabling only the distinction of size groups, not specific carnivores. In this work, we use a new technique combining three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and geometric morphometrics (GMM) of tooth pits on equid and bovid bone created by different carnivores (including crocodiles, hyenas, jaguars, lions and wolves) in controlled settings. The 3D methodology we present isolates and differentiates tooth marks generated by different carnivores. We also test the applicability of the technique to ascribe tooth pits recorded on some hominin specimens from FLK Zinj and FLKNN 3 (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). The tooth marks on the Olduvai OH8 and OH35 hominin fossils, previously assigned to crocodiles show that while OH8 tooth pit morphology falls in the range created by crocodiles, the pits on OH35 can not be interpreted as crocodile-inflicted marks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","source":"Scopus","title":"Discerning carnivore agency through the three-dimensional study of tooth pits: Revisiting crocodile feeding behaviour at FLK- Zinj and FLK NN3 (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania)","volume":"488","page start":"93","authors with affiliations":"Aramendi, J., Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain, IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Covarrubias 36, Madrid, 28010, Spain; Maté-González, M.A., Department of Cartography and Terrain Engineering, Polytechnic School of Avila, University of Salamanca, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila, 05003, Spain, C.A.I.

This assumption is now undermined, reviving questions of the origin and mechanism of these changes as well as the influence of Gaul\u0027s agricultural particularities in the process. To investigate this question we used a geometric morphometric approach to study the phenotypic relationships of almost 600 dental remains of pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) from 11 Gallic and Italian sites, and pinpoint evidence of Roman or indigenous signature on the livestock. The comparison of these different samples allowed us to demonstrate that the link between the Roman and Gallic pigs is weak, and, more importantly, that each of the two territories seem to follow its own livestock management model. Furthermore, each region or settlement within Gaul adopted their own particular pastoral or supplying strategies; apart from two urban sites of central Gaul which showed clear phenotypic relationships with southern populations. These results suggest that the pigs\u0027 morphology depended mainly on agricultural and economic characteristics of the different territories, within Gaul and Italy, except perhaps on some urban sites with different supply strategies. It seems, therefore, that the changing economic environment impacted both provinces independently, or at least differently, since it cannot be excluded that there may have been some commercial relationships between them. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Did Romanization impact Gallic pig morphology?

Since their discovery, natural agents such as trampling phenomena have been a topic of great taphonomic interest. Nevertheless, the majority of investigation into these traces has focused almost exclusively on their differentiation from other anthropic agents such as cut marks. In recent years, advances into bone surface modification analysis via geometric morphometrics have proven useful for in-depth characterization of different taphonomic traces; including cut, tooth and percussion marks. Through this, a preliminary study of trampling marks using advanced 3D digital microscopy was able to detect differences between what have since been known as scratch and graze marks. The present study expands from this, developing a more detailed analysis of these traces. Here, we use advanced data science techniques to provide a means of understanding trampling mark variations, contributing to our knowledge of site formation processes. Our results show how scratch and graze marks are a product of progressional decay and changes in cortical hardness, providing a new means of understanding taphonomic processes. Lay Description: The study of microscopic bone surface modifications in archaeology and palaeontology is of great importance, allowing for a detailed reconstruction of the formation of a site and providing a means of interpreting the fossil register. The damage that sedimentary abrasion can produce, however, is likely to distort and influence these studies, thus requiring a detailed understanding of the different traces that can be found on different materials. Here, we use advanced 3D digital microscopy and pattern recognition algorithms to analyse the different marks produced in different sedimentological contexts, also controlling for other variables such as the state of the bone when buried, the type of bone and the time exposed to these types of damages. Through this detailed microscopic analysis of these types of damages, we are able to conclude that morphological variations in trampling marks are product of the state of decay when the bones are buried. © 2020 The Authors Journal of Microscopy © 2020 Royal Microscopical Society","source":"Scopus","title":"Scratches and grazes: a detailed microscopic analysis of trampling phenomena","volume":"277","page start":"107","authors with affiliations":"Courtenay, L.A., Department of Cartographic and Terrain Engineering, Higher Polytechnic School of Ávila, Higher Polytechnic School of Ávila, University of Salamanca, Hornos Caleros 50, Ávila, 05003, Spain, Área de Prehistoria, Universitat de Rovir i Virgili (URV), Avignuda de Catalunya 35, Tarragona, 43002, Spain, Institut de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social (IPHES), C/Marcellí Domingo s/n, Campus Sescelades URV (Edifici W3) E3, Tarragona, 43002, Spain; Huguet, R., Área de Prehistoria, Universitat de Rovir i Virgili (URV), Avignuda de Catalunya 35, Tarragona, 43002, Spain, Institut de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social (IPHES), C/Marcellí Domingo s/n, Campus Sescelades URV (Edifici W3) E3, Tarragona, 43002, Spain, Unit Associated to CSIC, Departamento de Paleobiologia, Museo de Ciencias Naturales, calle José Gutiérrez Abascal, s/n, Madrid, 28006, Spain; Yravedra, J., Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain, Director of the C.

Over the last several decades, however, BSM identification has remained contentious, particularly in terms of identifying the earliest instances of hominin butchery; there has been a lack of consensus over how to identify or differentiate marks made by human and non-human actors and varying effectors. Most investigations have relied on morphology to identify butchery marks and their patterning. This includes cut marks, one of the most significant human marks. Attempts to discriminate cut marks from other types of marks have employed a variety of techniques, ranging from subjectively characterizing cut mark morphology using the naked eye, to using high-powered microscopy such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or micro-photogrammetry. More recent approaches use 3D datasets to obtain even more detailed information about mark attributes, and apply those to the fossil record. Although 3D datasets open promising new avenues for investigation, analyses of these datasets have not yet taken advantage of the full 3D surface morphology of BSM. Rather, selected cross-sectional slices of 3D scans have been used as proxies for overall shape. Here we demonstrate that 3D geometric morphometrics (GM), under the “Procrustes paradigm” and coupled with a Bayesian approach, probabilistically discriminates between marks caused by different butchery behaviors. At the same time, this approach provides a complete set of 3D morphological measurements and descriptions. Our results strengthen statistical confidence in cut mark identification and offer a novel approach that can be used to discriminate subtle differences between cut mark types in the fossil record. Furthermore, this study provides an incipient digital library with which to make future quantitative comparisons to archaeological examples, including contentious specimens that are key to understanding the earliest hominin butchery. © 2017 The Authors","source":"Scopus","title":"Differentiating between cutting actions on bone using 3D geometric morphometrics and Bayesian analyses with implications to human evolution","volume":"89","page start":"56","authors with affiliations":"Otárola-Castillo, E., Department of Anthropology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States; Torquato, M.G., Department of Anthropology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States; Hawkins, H.C., Department of Anthropology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States; James, E., School of Social Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Harris, J.A., Institute of Human Origins and School of Human Evolution and Social Change, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States; Marean, C.W., Institute of Human Origins and School of Human Evolution and Social Change, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States, African Centre for Coastal Palaeoscience, Nelson Mandela University, Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape  6031, South Africa; McPherron, S.P., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Thompson, J.C., Department of Anthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States","author(s) id":"25629989200;57201344983;57194942642;56942168700;57187418000;6701351179;6506777264;7405817918;","index keywords":"Bayesian analysis; bone; geometry; human evolution; morphometry; multivariate analysis; shape; taphonomy; three-dimensional modeling","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Butchery; Cut marks; Multivariate methods; Shape; Taphonomy","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Otárola-Castillo E., Torquato M.G., Hawkins H.C., James E., Harris J.A., Marean C.W., McPherron S.P., Thompson J.C.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2017.10.004"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Sharon G.","x":3524.969482421875,"y":-1570.48193359375,"id":"8628","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-69249114230","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"3","year":"2009","page end":"367","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-69249114230\u0026doi\u003d10.1086%2f598849\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d935768ea3fc3e590108d9065c46c2958","affiliations":"Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem 91905, Israel","source title":"Current Anthropology","abstract":"The ability to detach large (larger than 10 cm) flakes from giant cores and use them as blanks for the production of handaxes and cleavers is a technological hallmark distinguishing the Acheulian culture from its African predecessor, the Developed Oldowan, approximately 1.5 million years ago.

However, the method by which we identify and interpret these marks remains largely unchanged despite decades of research, relying on qualitative criteria and lacking standardization between analysts. Recently, zooarchaeologists have begun using new technologies capable of capturing 3-D data from bone surface modifications to advance our knowledge of these informative traces. However, an important step in this research has been overlooked and after years of work, we lack both a universal and replicable protocol and an understanding of the precision of these techniques. Here we propose a new standard for identifying bone surface modifications using high-resolution 3-D data and offer a systematic and replicable approach for researchers to follow. Data were collected with a white-light non-contact confocal profilometer and analyzed with Digital Surf\u0027s Mountains® software. Our data show that when methods are standardized, results between researchers are statistically indistinguishable. Multivariate analyses using the measured parameters allow discrimination between stone tool cut marks and mammalian carnivore tooth marks with 97.5% accuracy. Application of this method to fossil specimens resulted in 100% correspondence with identifications made by an experienced analyst using macroscopic observations of qualitative features of bone surface modifications.

Two outline-based approaches were selected: the Elliptic Fourier Analysis and the Discrete Cosine Transform. They were combined with numerous methods of standardisation/normalisation. Although standardisations may use either perimeter or surface, the resulting morphospaces remain comparable, and, interestingly, are also comparable with the morphospace built from traditional typology. Geometric morphometrics also presentthe advantage of being easily implemented and automated for large sets of artefacts. The method is reproducible and provides quantitative estimates, such as mean shape, and shape diversity of ceramic assemblages, allowing objective inferences to be statistically tested. The approach can easily be generalised and adopted for other kinds of artefacts, to study the level of production standardisation and the evolution of shape over space and time, and to provide information about material and cultural exchanges. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Morphometrics of Second Iron Age ceramics - strengths, weaknesses, and comparison with traditional typology","volume":"50","page start":"39","authors with affiliations":"Wilczek, J., ARTéHIS, UMR 6298 CNRS-Université de Bourgogne, ARTéHIS, Bat.

While previous studies have enriched our understanding of these practices among prehistoric Andean populations, the introduction of 3D surface scanners and geometric morphometric methods in archaeology enable us to examine head-shaping practices in novel ways. In this pilot study, we used a NextEngine 3D Laser Surface Scanner to generate high resolution models of artificially modified crania from four archaeological sites dating to the Archaic (2300–1600 BCE), Formative (500 CE), late Middle Horizon/early Late Intermediate period (LIP) (750–1100 CE) in Chile and late LIP crania (circa 1350 CE) from central, highland Peru. Landmarks were recorded on the 3D digital models of crania and these data were analyzed to assess variation in vault shape within and between the samples. Results of the PCA analysis showed graphical separation of the annular, tabular erect, and some tabular oblique types even when gross morphological assessments proved challenging. We documented marked variation within the general modification type traditionally identified as tabular oblique, which suggests more detailed classifications within this type are needed. We also investigated how standardized (i.e., similar) particular cranial modification types were at each site, and results show that the coastal sites of Morro 1 and Playa Miller 7, and the highlands Huari-Vegachayoc Moqo site show higher levels of standardization than the other four samples. This study highlights the utility of 3D imaging and geometric morphometric methods for straightforward, objective assessments of cranial modification and levels of standardization within sites and within particular modification types. This has implications for understanding the broader social and cultural significance of this practice, such as whether there were shared cultural norms about how a head should be modified, which could have led to highly uniform modification practices and head shapes in the Andes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"The application of 3D geometric morphometrics and laser surface scanning to investigate the standardization of cranial vault modification in the Andes","volume":"10","page start":"507","authors with affiliations":"Kuzminsky, S.C., Universidad Católica del Norte, Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Calle Gustavo Le Paige 380, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, University of California, Anthropology Department, Social Sciences 1, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA, United States; Tung, T.A., Vanderbilt University, Department of Anthropology, VU Station B #356050, 2301 Vanderbilt Place, Nashville, TN  37235, United States; Hubbe, M., Universidad Católica del Norte, Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo, Calle Gustavo Le Paige 380, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, The Ohio State University, Department of Anthropology, 4034 Smith Laboratory, 174 W. 18th Avenue, Columbus, OH  43210-1106, United States; Villaseñor-Marchal, A., Vanderbilt University, Department of Anthropology, VU Station B #356050, 2301 Vanderbilt Place, Nashville, TN  37235, United States","author(s) id":"42661433900;8571474900;10338946900;57192159433;","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"3D laser scanning; Andean archaeology; Archaeological science; Bioarchaeology; Biocultural anthropology; Cranial vault modification; Social identity","pr_indegree":"1.0","authors":"Kuzminsky S.C., Tung T.A., Hubbe M., Villaseñor-Marchal A.","doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.11.007"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":9.880000114440918},{"label":"Schillinger K., Mesoudi A., Lycett S.J.","x":3242.84912109375,"y":3744.8212890625,"id":"8946","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84901487216","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"1","year":"2014","page end":"143","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84901487216\u0026doi\u003d10.7183%2f0002-7316.79.1.128\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dce8a9661bddbfb2a9131776058a51a25","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, CT2 7NR, United Kingdom; Department of Anthropology, Durham University, Durham, United Kingdom","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"Copying errors that occur during the manufacture of artifactual traditions are potentially a major source of variation. It has been proposed that material items produced via \"additive\" processes (e.g., pottery) will possess less variation than traditions produced via \"reductive\" processes (e.g., stone knapping). The logic of this premise is that \"additive\" production methods more readily allow for the reversal of copying errors compared to strictly \"reductive-only\" processes. Here, we tested this hypothesis in shape data using an experimental framework in which we generated and statistically analyzed mor-phometric (size-adjusted) shape data under controlled and replicable conditions. Participants engaged in one of two alternative conditions: an irreversible (\"reductive-only\") manufacturing process or a reversible (\"additive-reductive\") process. With a number of factors held constant, participants were required to copy the shape of a \"target form\" as accurately as possible using a standardized block of plasticine and a steel table knife. Results demonstrated statistically greater levels of shape-copying errors in the replicas produced in the reductive-only condition. This indicates that \"mutation rates\" in the shape attributes of artifactual traditions produced via reductive processes are inherently greater than those produced via alternative means. Several implications for the study of variation in artifactual traditions are discussed.

It encompasses the posterior projection/convexity of the occipital squama and is associated with lambdoid flattening on the parietal. A \u0027hemibun\u0027 in some Upper Paleolithic Europeans is thought by some authors to indicate interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern Europeans. However, \u0027bunning\u0027 is difficult to measure, and the term has been applied to a range of morphological patterns. Furthermore, its usefulness in phylogenetic reconstruction and its homologous status across modern and fossil humans have been disputed. We present a geometric morphometric study that quantitatively evaluates the chignon, assesses its usefulness in separating Neanderthals from modern humans, and its degree of similarity to Upper Paleolithic \u0027hemibuns.\u0027 We measured the three-dimensional coordinates of closely spaced points along the midsagittal plane from bregma to inion and of anatomical landmarks in a large series of recent human crania and several Middle and Late Pleistocene European and African fossils. These coordinate data were processed using the techniques of geometric morphometrics and analyzed with relative warps, canonical variates, and singular warps. Our results show no separation between Neanderthals and modern humans, including early modern Europeans, when the shape of the occipital plane midsagittal-profile is considered alone. On the other hand, Neanderthals are well separated from both recent and fossil modern humans when information about the occipital\u0027s relative position and relative size are also included. Furthermore, the occurrence of a highly convex and posteriorly projecting midline occipital profile (interpreted as the occipital bun) is highly correlated (\u003e0.8) with a flat parietal midsagittal profile and with antero-superiorly positioned temporal bones across both our recent and our fossil human samples. We conclude that the shape of the occipital profile alone should not be considered an independent trait, as it is very tightly integrated with braincase shape. Our analysis does not support differences in integration of the posterior midsagittal profile and the cranial base in Pleistocene and recent humans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Harpending and Ward (1982) developed a model that aids in this effort by comparing observed and expected heterozygosity within populations in a local region. The expected heterozygosity within a population is a function of the total heterozygosity of the entire region and the distance of the population from the regional mean centroid of allele frequencies. Greater than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having greater heterozygosity than expected. Less than average gene flow from an external source will result in a population having less heterozygosity than expected. We extend the Harpending-Ward model to quantitative traits using an equal and additive effects model of inheritance. Here the additive genetic variance within a population is directly proportional to heterozygosity, and its expectation is directly proportional to the genetic distance from the centroid. Under certain assumptions the expectations for phenotypic variances are similar. Observed and expected genetic or phenotypic variance can then be compared to assess the effects of differential external gene flow. When the additive genetic covariance matrix or heritabilities are not known, the phenotypic covariance matrix can be used to provide a conservative application of the model. In addition, we develop new methods for estimation of the genetic relationship matrix (R) from quantitative traits. We apply these models to two data sets: (1) six principal components derived from twenty dermatoglyphic ridge count measures for nine villages in Nepal and (2) ten anthropometric measurements for seven isolated populations in western Ireland. In both cases both the univariate and multivariate analyses provide results that can be directly interpreted in terms of historically known patterns of gene flow.","source":"Scopus","title":"Detection of differential gene flow from patterns of quantitative variation","volume":"62","page start":"5","authors with affiliations":"Relethford, J.H., Department of Genetics, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, P.O.

This indicates that mark perception and interpretation is a highly subjective process.

Here, analysis of variation in seed morphology aims to provide accurate criteria for the discrimination between wild grapes and modern cultivars and to understand changes in functional traits in relation to the domestication process. This approach is also used to quantify the phenotypic diversity in the wild and cultivated compartments and to provide a starting point for comparing well-preserved archaeological material, in order to elucidate the history of grapevine varieties. METHODS: Geometrical analysis (elliptic Fourier transform method) was applied to grapevine seed outlines from modern wild individuals, cultivars and well-preserved archaeological material from southern France, dating back to the first to second centuries. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Significant relationships between seed shape and taxonomic status, geographical origin (country or region) of accessions and parentage of varieties are highlighted, as previously noted based on genetic approaches. The combination of the analysis of modern reference material and well-preserved archaeological seeds provides original data about the history of ancient cultivated forms, some of them morphologically close to the current \u0027Clairette\u0027 and \u0027Mondeuse blanche\u0027 cultivars. Archaeobiological records seem to confirm the complexity of human contact, exchanges and migrations which spread grapevine cultivation in Europe and in Mediterranean areas, and argue in favour of the existence of local domestication in the Languedoc (southern France) region during Antiquity.","source":"Scopus","title":"Evolution and history of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) under domestication: new morphometric perspectives to understand seed domestication syndrome and reveal origins of ancient European cultivars.","volume":"105","authors with affiliations":"Terral, J.F., Biodiversité, UMR 5059 CNRS/UM2/EPHE, Equipe Ressources Biologiques, Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie, Sociétés, Institut de Botanique (Université Montpellier 2), 163 Rue Auguste Broussonet, Montpellier, 34090, France;

The house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) progression in the Mediterranean begins with a quick but limited diffusion in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin achieved around the 8th millennium BC. Until the 1st millennium BC, the invasive process seems to have stopped or drastically slowed, despite the increasing opportunities of passive transport during the Bronze Age. During the 1st millennium BC, there was mass colonization by the house mouse of the entire Western Mediterranean Basin and Northern Europe. We propose to explain this chronological gap in the colonization of the Eastern and Western Mediterranean using source-sink theory considering that the western environments acted like sinks until the first millennium BC. At that time the Western Mediterranean was fully opened to Eastern influences and migrations, and the human pressures on the environment drastically increased.

This methodological paper examines approaches to optimizing the classification of specimens based on their outlines. This study examines the performance of four approaches to the mathematical representation of outlines and two different approaches to curve measurement as applied to a collection of feather outlines. A new approach to the dimension reduction necessary to carry out a CVA on this type of outline data with modest sample sizes is also presented, and its performance is compared to two other approaches to dimension reduction. Results: Two semi-landmark-based methods, bending energy alignment and perpendicular projection, are shown to produce roughly equal rates of classification, as do elliptical Fourier methods and the extended eigenshape method of outline measurement. Rates of classification were not highly dependent on the number of points used to represent a curve or the manner in which those points were acquired. The new approach to dimensionality reduction, which utilizes a variable number of principal component (PC) axes, produced higher cross-validation assignment rates than either the standard approach of using a fixed number of PC axes or a partial least squares method. Conclusion: Classification of specimens based on feather shape was not highly dependent of the details of the method used to capture shape information. The choice of dimensionality reduction approach was more of a factor, and the cross validation rate of assignment may be optimized using the variable number of PC axes method presented herein. © 2006 Sheets et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Comparison of geometric morphometric outline methods in the discrimination of age-related differences in feather shape","volume":"3","authors with affiliations":"Sheets, H.D., Department of Physics, Canisius College, 2001 Main St., Buffalo, NY 14208, United States; Covino, K.M., Department of Biology, Canisius College, 2001 Main St., Buffalo, NY 14208, United States; Panasiewicz, J.M., Department of Biology, Canisius College, 2001 Main St., Buffalo, NY 14208, United States; Morris, S.R., Department of Biology, Canisius College, 2001 Main St., Buffalo, NY 14208, United States","author(s) id":"55663863700;14830225900;14830383200;7403325929;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"8.0","authors":"Sheets H.D., Covino K.M., Panasiewicz J.M., Morris S.R.","doi":"10.1186/1742-9994-3-15"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":37.040000915527344},{"label":"Cucchi T., Hulme-Beaman A., Yuan J., Dobney K.","x":-853.5401000976562,"y":12.216984748840332,"id":"9042","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-78049286754","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.01443298969072165","Modularity Class":"1","issue":"1","year":"2011","page end":"22","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-78049286754\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2010.07.024\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d0084c30bbeb6a2069f8cc45945a729b3","affiliations":"CNRS-Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, UMR 7209, Archéoozoologie, histoire des sociétés humaines et de peuplements animaux, 55 rue Buffon, 75005 Paris, France; Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, St.Mary\u0027s Building, Elphinstone Road, United Kingdom; Department of Archaeology, University of Durham, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Institute of Archaeology, 27 Wangfujing Street, Beijing 100710, China","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"The zooarchaeology of pig domestication in China is a challenging task due to its wild boar ancestors being widespread throughout Eurasia.

Their origin likely relates to an episode of recolonization of Western Eurasia by hominins of African origin carrying the Acheulean technology into Europe around 600 ka. An enhancement of both glacial and interglacial phases may have played a crucial role in this event, as well as in the subsequent evolutionary history of the Western Eurasian populations. In addition to climatic adaptations and an increase in encephalization, genetic drift seems to have played a major role in their evolution. To date, a clear speciation event is not documented, and the most likely scenario for the fixation of Neandertal characteristics seems to be an accretion of features along the second half of the MP.

The shape of the external basicranial portion of the temporal bone, in particular, has been found to have one of the strongest phylogenetic signals in the crania, and so it can be effectively used to distinguish between populations on a large, often global scale. However, its applicability to the analysis of relatively closely-related groups remains largely unexplored. The retention of population signatures in the shape of this portion of the temporal bone is particularly useful for archaeology, as the fragility of the cranium makes analysis of its shape in entirety often difficult. If the shape of the temporal bone can identify differences between relatively closely-related populations with a similar accuracy as for more distantly-related populations, this would significantly aid analyses of population history on a local scale. To test this, we initiated a study that used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to investigate the shape variation of the temporal bone of two British archaeological populations that were separated both temporally and geographically. The results of a MANOVA found statistically significant shape differences between the two populations and a DFA found that the shape of the temporal bone can correctly classify 84.7% of individuals into their respective population. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that the shape of the temporal bone can accurately identify differences between two relatively closely-related populations.

The analysis of these marks may permit us to know more about who was involved in the making the of prehistoric images as well as expanding the literature on the evolution of human behaviour. A number of researchers have previously attempted to identify the sex of the makers of Upper Palaeolithic hand stencils using methods based on hand size and digit length ratios obtained from digital or photo-based images of modern reference samples. Some analyses report that it was males who were responsible for the majority of hand stencils, whilst the most recent analysis determined that females produced the majority of hand stencils. Taken together, however, these studies generate contrasting and incompatible interpretations. In this study we critically review where we currently stand with methods of sexing the makers of hand stencils and the problems for the interpretation of hand markings of Palaeolithic age. We then present the results of a new method of predicting the sex of individuals from their hand stencils using a geometric morphometric approach that detects sexual differences in hand shape and hand form (size and shape). The method has the additional advantage of being able to detect these differences in both complete, as well as partial hand stencils. Finally we urge researchers to test this method on other ethnic groups and populations and consider ways of combining efforts towards a common goal of developing a robust, predictive methodology based on diverse modern samples before it is applied to Upper Palaeolithic hand stencils. © 2016 The Authors","source":"Scopus","title":"Beyond size: The potential of a geometric morphometric analysis of shape and form for the assessment of sex in hand stencils in rock art","volume":"78","page start":"202","authors with affiliations":"Nelson, E., School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Whelan Building, University of Liverpool, Brownlow HillL69 3GB, United Kingdom, Archaeology Classics and Egyptology, Abercromby Square, University of LiverpoolL69 7ZG, United Kingdom; Hall, J., Archaeology Classics and Egyptology, Abercromby Square, University of LiverpoolL69 7ZG, United Kingdom; Randolph-Quinney, P., School of Forensic and Applied Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, PR1 2HE, United Kingdom, School of Anatomical Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, 7 York Road, Parktown, Johannesburg, 2193, South Africa, Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the Witwatersrand, Wits, Johannesburg, 2050, South Africa; Sinclair, A., Archaeology Classics and Egyptology, Abercromby Square, University of LiverpoolL69 7ZG, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"35105614600;57192811548;56862348800;56358638800;","index keywords":"anthropology; archaeology; biometry; cave; dating method; forensic science; morphometry; Paleolithic; prehistoric; rock art; Greater Sunda Islands; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Biometrics; Cave art; Forensic anthropology; Geometric morphometrics; Palaeolithic; Sex assessment","pr_indegree":"2.0","authors":"Nelson E., Hall J., Randolph-Quinney P., Sinclair A.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2016.11.001"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":13.760000228881836},{"label":"González-José R., Martínez-Abadías N., González-Martín A., Bautista-Martínez J., Gómez-Valdés J., Quinto M., Hernández M.","x":557.8150634765625,"y":-1541.147705078125,"id":"7987","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33947528330","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"1610","year":"2007","page end":"688","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-33947528330\u0026doi\u003d10.1098%2frspb.2006.0151\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dad97be0c4afe220aba9a5cd9d7e74a10","affiliations":"Centro Nacional Patagónico, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas Y Técnicas, Boulevard Brown 3500, U9120ACV Puerto Madryn, Argentina; Unitat d\u0027Antropologia, Facultat de Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Diagonal 645, 08028 Barcelona, Spain; Departamento de Zoología Y Antropología Física, Facultad de Biología, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain; Dirección de Antropología Física, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Juarez 425-431, Colonia Centro, 91700 Veracruz, Mexico; Área Académica de Historia Y Antropología, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo, Pachuca, Hidalgo 42160, Mexico","source title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","abstract":"The Mexica Empire reached an outstanding social, economic and politic organization among Mesoamerican civilizations. Even though archaeology and history provide substantial information about their past, their biological origin and the demographic consequences of their settlement in the Central Valley of Mexico remain unsolved. Two main hypotheses compete to explain the Mexica origin: a social reorganization of the groups already present in the Central Valley after the fall of the Classic centres or a population replacement of the Mesoamerican groups by migrants from the north and the consequent setting up of the Mexica society. Here, we show that the main changes in the facial phenotype occur during the Classic-Postclassic transition, rather than in the rise of the Mexica. Furthermore, Mexica facial morphology seems to be already present in the early phases of the Postclassic epoch and is not related to the northern facial pattern. A combination of geometric morphometrics with Relethford-Blangero analyses of within- versus among-group variation indicates that Postclassic groups are more variable man expected. This result suggests that intense gene exchange was likely after the fall of the Classic and maybe responsible for the Postclassic facial phenotype. The source population for the Postclassic groups could be located somewhere in western Mesoamerica, since North Mexico and Central Mesoamerican Preclassic and Classic groups are clearly divergent from the Postclassic ones. Similarity among Preclassic and Classic groups and those from Aridoamerica could be reflecting the ancestral phenotypic pattern characteristic of the groups diat first settled Mesoamerica. © 2006 The Royal Society.","source":"Scopus","title":"Detection of a population replacement at the Classic-Postclassic transition in Mexico","volume":"274","page start":"681","authors with affiliations":"González-José, R., Centro Nacional Patagónico, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas Y Técnicas, Boulevard Brown 3500, U9120ACV Puerto Madryn, Argentina; Martínez-Abadías, N., Unitat d\u0027Antropologia, Facultat de Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Diagonal 645, 08028 Barcelona, Spain; González-Martín, A., Departamento de Zoología Y Antropología Física, Facultad de Biología, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain; Bautista-Martínez, J., Dirección de Antropología Física, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Juarez 425-431, Colonia Centro, 91700 Veracruz, Mexico; Gómez-Valdés, J., Dirección de Antropología Física, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Juarez 425-431, Colonia Centro, 91700 Veracruz, Mexico; Quinto, M., Área Académica de Historia Y Antropología, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo, Pachuca, Hidalgo 42160, Mexico; Hernández, M., Unitat d\u0027Antropologia, Facultat de Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Diagonal 645, 08028 Barcelona, Spain","author(s) id":"6602423911;9739700800;6701477260;16063190900;16063951800;16064455200;7401971749;","index keywords":"archaeology; civilization; Classic period; demography; divergence; human settlement; hypothesis testing; morphometry; phenotype; population regulation; replacement; archeology; article; face; geological time; human; life history; Mexico; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; population dynamics; priority journal; social structure; anthropometry; cluster analysis; comparative study; histology; history; phenotype; physical anthropology; population genetics; skull; Mexico [North America]; North America; Anthropometry; Cluster Analysis; Craniology; Genetics, Population; History, 15th Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Mexico; Phenotype; Population Dynamics; Skull","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Classic-postclassic transition; Facial shape; Geometric morphometrics; Mesoamerica; Mexica; Population replacement","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"González-José R., Martínez-Abadías N., González-Martín A., Bautista-Martínez J., Gómez-Valdés J., Quinto M., Hernández M.","doi":"10.1098/rspb.2006.0151"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Dibble H.L.","x":-549.701416015625,"y":4417.6455078125,"id":"8966","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0000994083","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"6","year":"1984","source title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Interpreting typological variation of Middle Paleolithic scrapers: Function, style, or sequence of reduction?","volume":"11","authors with affiliations":"Dibble, H.L.","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Dibble H.L."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Buikstra J.E., Ubelaker D.H.","x":88.79742431640625,"y":-1930.5499267578125,"id":"8648","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003655056","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.018556701030927835","authors with affiliations":"Buikstra, J.E.; Ubelaker, D.H.","Modularity Class":"4","year":"1994","source title":"Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"9.0","title":"Standards for data collection from human skeletal remains","authors":"Buikstra J.E., Ubelaker D.H."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":40.92000198364258},{"label":"Grosman L., Smikt O., Smilansky U.","x":2867.580322265625,"y":832.203857421875,"id":"8815","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-51249089236","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.01443298969072165","Modularity Class":"5","issue":"12","year":"2008","page end":"3110","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-51249089236\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2008.06.011\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d81e7ff712f2bf310bcd485aeb25bd909","affiliations":"Department of Physics of Complex Systems, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel; The Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem, 91904, Israel; Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 76100, Israel; Cardiff School of Mathematics, WIMCS, Cardiff University, Senghennydd Road, Cardiff, CF24 4AG, United Kingdom","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"A 3-D optical scanner was used to obtain precise and complete representations of lithic artifacts.

In this study, dental crown shape of the three early Pleistocene hominin teeth (P3, M1, and M1) found in Jianshi, Hubei Province of China was analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. The comparative samples of fossil hominins from Africa, Asia, and Europe as well as those of modern humans (N \u003d 257) were used. The results indicate that the contour, asymmetry, and cusp patterns of these three types of teeth differ obviously between the fossil hominins and modern humans. The crown shape of P3 in most fossil hominins including Australopithecus, African early Homo, and Asian Pleistocene hominins are asymmetric with their crown occlusal contours long and curving elliptic-shaped. The occlusal contour of the fossil hominin M1 is symmetric and rectangle-shaped with no marked cusp protrusion. The crown shape of fossil M1 is characterized by asymmetric contour with slightly projected metaconid and hypoconid. On the contrary, in modern Chinese and some European late Pleistocene hominins, the crowns of P3s show symmetric contours with buccal side wider than lingual side; the crown shape of M1 is asymmetric with lingual cusp distalplaced, especially for hypoconid; the M1 has symmetric and round crown contour. Our study reveals that Australopithecus has wide variations in its crown shape, whereas these dental morphospaces of Asian hominins are closely placed. The crown contour, symmetry, and cusp patterns of these three teeth of Jianshi hominin resemble those of Asian early and middle Pleistocene hominins. No marked difference in dental crown shape is shown between the Jianshi hominin and other Chinese Homo erectus, and there is also no evidence in support of the Jianshi hominin\u0027s closeness to Australopithecus and African early Homo members. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","source":"Scopus","title":"Geometric morphometric analysis of the early Pleistocene hominin teeth from Jianshi, Hubei Province, China","volume":"53","page start":"1141","authors with affiliations":"Liu, W., Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100044, China; Clarke, R., University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa; Xing, S., Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100044, China, Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China","author(s) id":"28567979400;57192902027;35195151700;","index keywords":"Crown shape; Dental crowns; East Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Hominins; Homo erectus; Hubei Province; Human evolution; Late Pleistocene; Morphometric analysis; Pleistocene; Geometry; Dentistry; asymmetry; fossil record; geometry; hominid; human evolution; morphology; morphometry; Pleistocene; shape; symmetry; taxonomy; tooth; China; Hubei; Jianshi; Australopithecus; Homo erectus","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"China; geometric morphometric; Hubei; human evolution; Jianshi; shape; tooth","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Liu W., Clarke R., Xing S.","doi":"10.1007/s11430-010-4013-0"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Castiñeira C., Charlin J., Cardillo M., Baeza J.","x":-779.4996948242188,"y":4764.091796875,"id":"8857","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84884404999","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"6","year":"2012","page end":"62","source title":"Southbound: Late Pleistocene Peopling of Latin America","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Exploring morphometric variations in fishtail projectile points from Uruguay, Pampa and Patagonia","page start":"57","authors with affiliations":"Castiñeira, C.; Charlin, J.; Cardillo, M.; Baeza, J.","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Castiñeira C., Charlin J., Cardillo M., Baeza J."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Adams D.C., Rohlf F.J., Slice D.E.","x":347.93621826171875,"y":37.546302795410156,"id":"8742","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-1242321708","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.04536082474226804","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"1","year":"2004","page end":"16","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-1242321708\u0026doi\u003d10.1080%2f11250000409356545\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d74fa0a4ec02d5ccc6f34b38d4e228cd8","affiliations":"Department of Ecology, Evolution, Organismal Biology, Department of Statistics, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, 50011–3223, United States; Department of Ecology and Evolution, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY, 11794–5245, United States; Institute for Anthropology, University of Vienna, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157–1022, Austria; Department of Medical Engineering, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, 27157–1022, United States","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Italian Journal of Zoology","abstract":"The analysis of shape is a fundamental part of much biological research. As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

Morphological attributes of the cut marks were measured using an Alicona imaging microscope, a novel optical technique that generates three-dimensional virtual reconstructions of surface features. The study shows that high-resolution measurements of cut marks can shed light on aspects of butchery techniques, tool use and the behavioural repertoire of Lower Palaeolithic hominins. Differences between the experimental cut marks and those on the Boxgrove large mammal bones suggest variation in the angle of the cuts and greater forces used in the butchery of the larger (rhinoceros-sized) carcasses at Boxgrove. Tool-edge characteristics may account for some of these differences, but the greater robusticity of the Boxgrove hominins (attributed to Homo heidelbergensis) may be a factor in the greater forces indicated by some of the cut marks on the Boxgrove specimens. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Research examining South American skeletons \u003e8000 cal BP has revealed differences in cranial morphology between early and late Holocene populations, which may reflect distinct migration events and/or populations. However, genetic, cultural, and some skeletal data contradict this model. Given these discrepancies, this study examines ∼9000 years of prehistory to test the hypothesis that Early skeletons have a distinct cranial morphology from later skeletons. Materials and Methods: Using 3D digital models, craniofacial landmarks, and geometric morphometric analyses, we compared Early Holocene crania (n \u003d 4) to later Chilean samples (n \u003d 90) frequently absent in continental assessments of craniofacial variation. PCA, Mahalanobis distances, posterior and typicality probabilities were used to examine variation. Results: Two of the earliest skeletons from northern Chile show clear affinities to individuals from later sites in the same region. However, the hypothesis cannot be rejected as one Early individual from northern Chile and one individual from inland Patagonia did not always show clear affinities to coastal populations. Discussion: Biological affinities among northern populations and other regions of Chile align with genetic and archaeological data, supporting cultural and biological continuity along the Pacific Coast. In Patagonia, archaeological data are in accordance with skeletal differences between the Early inland steppe individual and coastal populations. This study incorporates 3D methods and skeletal datasets not widely used in assessments of biological affinity, thus contributing to a critical body of research examining the ancient population history of western South America. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Investigating cranial morphological variation of early human skeletal remains from Chile: A 3D geometric morphometric approach","volume":"165","page start":"223","authors with affiliations":"Kuzminsky, S.C., Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo R.P Gustavo Le Paige, Universidad Católica del Norte, Gustavo Le Paige 380, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, Anthropology Department, University of California, 156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA, United States; Reyes Báez, O., Centro de Estudios del Hombre Austral, Instituto de la Patagonia, Universidad de Magallanes, Avenida Bulnes 01890 Casilla 113D, Punta Arenas, Chile; Arriaza, B., Instituto de Alta Investigación, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile; Méndez, C., Centro de Investigación en Ecosistemas de la Patagonia, Moraleda 16, Coyhaique, Chile; Standen, V.G., Departamento de Antropología, Universidad de Tarapacá, 18 de Septiembre 2222, Casilla 6-D, Arica, Chile; San Román, M., Centro de Estudios del Hombre Austral, Instituto de la Patagonia, Universidad de Magallanes, Avenida Bulnes 01890 Casilla 113D, Punta Arenas, Chile; Muñoz, I., Departamento de Antropología, Universidad de Tarapacá, 18 de Septiembre 2222, Casilla 6-D, Arica, Chile; Durán Herrera, Á., Museo La Serena, Calle Cienfuegos, La Serena, Chile; Hubbe, M., Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas y Museo R.P Gustavo Le Paige, Universidad Católica del Norte, Gustavo Le Paige 380, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile, Department of Anthropology, 4034 Smith Laboratory, The Ohio State University, 174 W. 18th Avenue, Columbus, OH, United States","author(s) id":"42661433900;22735672600;6602846124;35576830900;6602356440;23394020200;36788343700;57196390913;10338946900;","index keywords":"anatomic landmark; anatomical variation; archeology; Article; bone age determination; bone microarchitecture; Chilean; controlled study; human; human tissue; Late Holocene; morphometry; prehistoric period; skull; South America; adult; American Indian; anatomic model; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; Chile; female; history; male; migration; physical anthropology; procedures; skull; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Anthropology, Physical; Cephalometry; Chile; Female; History, Ancient; Human Migration; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Indians, South American; Male; Models, Anatomic; Skull","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"ancient human migration; bioarchaeology; Early American crania; South America","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Kuzminsky S.C., Reyes Báez O., Arriaza B., Méndez C., Standen V.G., San Román M., Muñoz I., Durán Herrera Á., Hubbe M.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.23344"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Cucchi T., Fujita M., Dobney K.","x":-735.2324829101562,"y":104.5316162109375,"id":"9265","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-70349639859","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.010309278350515464","Modularity Class":"1","issue":"4","year":"2009","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-70349639859\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2foa.974\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d22fe65c34585469109ab81e658b57e75","affiliations":"Department of Archaeology, University of Durham, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom; UMR 5197, Département Ecologie et Gestion de la Biodiversité, Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, 55 rue Buffon, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France","source title":"International Journal of Osteoarchaeology","abstract":"Despite the almost ubiquitous presence of Holocene Sus remains in Island South East Asia (ISEA), the domestication of pigs and their dispersal in this region remains somewhat confused. Using molar shape geometric morphometric analysis, archaeological Sus dental series from the Sarawak caves of Niah (Aceramic, Neolithic) and Lobang Kudih (Ming period), are compared with extant ISEA wild pigs to establish their taxonomic status and to further explore the evidence for local domestication or introduction of allochthonous populations. Results on modern data-sets show that outline analysis of the third lower molar achieves highly significant inter- and intra-specific differentiation among ISEA wild pigs, with a phenotypic divergence structure displaying congruence with molecular phylogenies. Both tooth shape and mtDNA evidence strongly suggest the so-called wild pigs of New Guinea to be the descendants of pigs domesticated in mainland South East Asia and introduced by early farmers to ISEA. None of our data provide clear evidence for a Neolithic introduction of domesticated pigs, or for the local domestication of indigenous bearded pigs, since all Aceramic and Neolithic pigs from Niah cave have been identified as indigenous bearded pig (Sus barbatus). Local domestication experiments by foragers have not been ruled out, since evidence of hypoplasia as a marker of domestication processes has been observed. Introduction of allochthonous domestic pigs between the Late Neolithic and the Metal Age is suggested, since this small domestic breed from Lobang Kudih cave displays strong phenetic relationships with S. scrofa of New Guinea, recognised by molecular phylogeography as part of the \u0027Pacific Clade\u0027 linked both with Lapita and Polynesian dispersals. Introduction of celebensis-like species has also been suggested. Future studies should incorporate broader time-scale and geographical framework data-sets to strengthen these assumptions.

One means of supplementing fossil evidence is to utilize archaeological evidence in the form of stone tools. Based on broad dating patterns, it has long been thought that the appearance of Acheulean handaxe technologies outside of Africa was the result of hominin dispersals, yet independent tests of this hypothesis remain rare. Cultural transmission theory leads to a prediction of a strong African versus non-African phylogeographic pattern in handaxe datasets, if the African Acheulean hypothesis is to be supported. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, this prediction is tested using an intercontinental dataset of Acheulean handaxes and a biological phylogenetic method (maximum parsimony). The analyses produce a tree consistent with the phylogeographic prediction. Moreover, a bootstrap analysis provides evidence that this pattern is robust, and the maximum parsimony tree is also shown to be statistically different from a tree constrained by stone raw materials. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate that nested analyses of behavioural data, utilizing methods drawn from biology, have the potential to shed light on ancient hominin dispersals. This is an encouraging prospect for human palaeobiology since sample sizes for lithic artefacts are many orders of magnitude higher than those of fossil data. These analyses also suggest that the sustained occurrence of Acheulean handaxe technologies in regions such as Europe and the Indian subcontinent resulted from dispersals by African hominin populations. © 2009 Stephen J.

Over several decades comparisons of Soanian assemblages have been made with the non-bifacial industries of East Asia and north-west Europe. The chronological status and typo-technological relationship(s) of the Soanian to other Palaeolithic industries have been the subject of much debate. When first named and described the Soanian was considered to contain evidence of Mode 3 Levallois-style core reduction. However, in recent years, the potential Mode 3 component of the Soanian has largely been ignored, and the techno-complex is described under various guises as a core/flake or \u0027Mode 1\u0027 techno-complex. Here, a comparative morphometric assessment of selected Soanian cores and other Palaeolithic nuclei is undertaken, to test the hypothesis that this industry contains a definite Mode 3 Levallois element. Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) of morphometric variables provide robust evidence that at least part of the Soanian techno-complex contains Mode 3 Levallois cores. The implications of these analyses for the relationship between the Soanian and the Acheulean, and the relevance of the Soanian in considerations of the Movius Line are also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A search of the recent otolith chemistry literature showed that these two concerns are sometimes ignored, so we used simulated data sets to explore the potential pitfalls of such oversights. We found that when estimating reclassification success for a training data set, small sample sizes or unbalanced sampling designs can produce remarkably high reclassification success rates by chance alone, especially when prior probabilities are estimated from sample size. When using a training data set to classify unknown individuals, maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions and group membership afforded up to 20% improvement over DFA with uninformative priors when groups contributed to the sample unequally. Given these results, we recommend the use of (1) randomization tests to estimate the probability that reclassification success is better than random, and (2) maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions in place of uninformative priors. © Inter-Research 2007.","source":"Scopus","title":"Discriminant function analysis in marine ecology: Some oversights and their solutions","volume":"329","page start":"301","authors with affiliations":"White, J.W., Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States; Ruttenberg, B.I., Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106, United States","author(s) id":"36467191300;8967287900;","index keywords":"classification; data set; discriminant analysis; marine ecosystem; maximum likelihood analysis; otolith; probability","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Classification; Discriminant function analysis; Jackknife reclassification success; Null hypothesis; Otolith chemistry; Prior probabilities; Randomization test","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"White J.W., Ruttenberg B.I.","doi":"10.3354/meps329301"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Harvati K., Hublin J.-J., Gunz P.","x":598.6401977539062,"y":-4311.33203125,"id":"8851","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77958177900","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.004123711340206186","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"5","year":"2010","page end":"464","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-77958177900\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jhevol.2010.06.005\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d182a4071bbd6819561c059ce96f0cac1","affiliations":"Paleoanthropology Section, Dept. of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology, Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Paleoecology, Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, Rümelinstr. 23, 72070 Tübingen, Baden-Württenberg, Germany; Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany","source title":"Journal of Human Evolution","abstract":"The classification and phylogenetic relationships of the middle Pleistocene human fossil record remains one of the most intractable problems in paleoanthropology.

We approach these questions using geometric morphometric methods which allow the intuitive visualization and quantification of features previously described qualitatively. We apply these techniques to evaluate proposed cranio-facial \u0027incipient\u0027 facial, vault, and basicranial traits in a middle-late Pleistocene European hominin sample when compared to a sample of the same time depth from Africa. Some of the features examined followed the predictions of the accretion model and relate the middle Pleistocene European material to the later Neanderthals. However, although our analysis showed a clear separation between Neanderthals and early/recent modern humans and morphological proximity between European specimens from OIS 7 to 3, it also shows that the European hominins from the first half of the middle Pleistocene still shared most of their cranio-facial architecture with their African contemporaries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Evolution of middle-late Pleistocene human cranio-facial form: A 3-D approach","volume":"59","page start":"445","authors with affiliations":"Harvati, K., Paleoanthropology Section, Dept. of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology, Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Paleoecology, Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, Rümelinstr. 23, 72070 Tübingen, Baden-Württenberg, Germany, Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany; Hublin, J.-J., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany; Gunz, P., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany","author(s) id":"57203032637;6602606027;6506472733;","index keywords":"archaeology; cranium; fossil record; human evolution; morphometry; Neanderthal; Pleistocene; three-dimensional modeling; visualization; Homo heidelbergensis","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Face; Geometric morphometrics; Homo heidelbergensis; Neanderthal; Occipital; Temporal","pr_indegree":"2.0","authors":"Harvati K., Hublin J.-J., Gunz P.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.06.005"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":13.760000228881836},{"label":"Monteiro L.R.","x":-528.751708984375,"y":-200.59579467773438,"id":"9348","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0033084978","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.010309278350515464","Modularity Class":"1","issue":"1","year":"1999","page end":"199","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0033084978\u0026doi\u003d10.1080%2f106351599260526\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dd5de5cdefa57c1656189788e005fb8b9","affiliations":"Departamento de Zoologia, UNESP, caixa postal 199, Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, cep 13506-900, Brazil","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Systematic Biology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Multivariate regression models and geometric morphometrics: The search for causal factors in the analysis of shape","volume":"48","page start":"192","authors with affiliations":"Monteiro, L.R., Departamento de Zoologia, UNESP, caixa postal 199, Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, cep 13506-900, Brazil","author(s) id":"7103010498;","index keywords":"age; animal; article; body constitution; bone; histology; multivariate analysis; rat; regression analysis; statistical model; Age Factors; Animals; Body Constitution; Bone and Bones; Models, Statistical; Multivariate Analysis; Rats; Regression Analysis","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"5.0","authors":"Monteiro L.R.","doi":"10.1080/106351599260526"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":25.399999618530273},{"label":"Ciarlo N.C., Charlin J., Alberti J., Buscaglia S., Vivar Lombarte G., Geli Mauri R.","x":62.92439651489258,"y":2121.088134765625,"id":"221","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85073772794","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"12","year":"2019","page end":"6582","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85073772794\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs12520-019-00925-1\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d0c5beb733a00e7bf778447fdecada6c1","affiliations":"National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas - CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina; Institute of Archaeology, School of Philosophy \u0026 Liberal Arts, University of Buenos Aires (Instituto de Arqueología, Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Universidad de Buenos Aires), Buenos Aires, Argentina; Multidisciplinary Institute of History and Human Sciences of CONICET (Instituto Multidisciplinario de Historia y Ciencias Humanas - IMHICIHU-CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina; School of Philosophy \u0026 Liberal Arts, University of Buenos Aires (Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Universidad de Buenos Aires), Buenos Aires, Argentina; Centre for Underwater Archaeology of Catalonia, Archaeological Museum of Catalonia (Centre d’Arqueologia Subaquàtica de Catalunya, Museu d’Arqueologia de Catalunya - CASC-MAC), Girona, Spain","source title":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","abstract":"Gunflints represent a worldwide feature of lithic technology in modern times.

In this paper, we show that continuous phenotypic change can be described by trajectories in multivariate data spaces. We describe the geometric attributes of phenotypic change trajectories (size, direction, and shape), specifically for GM data. We illustrate, with examples, how differences in such attributes can function as test statistics for comparative analyses in order to understand the mechanisms that produce dynamic differences in shape change. We demonstrate that analysis of such attributes - called phenotypic trajectory analysis (PTA) - is a general analysis that can be applied to various types of research questions concerned with measuring dynamic variation.

However, some aspects concerning the population affinities among early and modern Asians and Native Americans remain controversial. Specifically, contradictory views based mainly on partial evidence such as skull morphology or molecular genetics have led to hypotheses such as the \"Two Waves/Components\" and \"Single Wave\" or \"Out of Beringia\" model, respectively. Alternatively, an integrative scenario considering both morphological and molecular variation has been proposed and named as the \"Recurrent Gene Flow\" hypothesis. This scenario considers a single origin for all the Native Americans, and local, within-continent evolution plus the persistence of contact among Circum-Arctic groups. Here we analyze 2D geometric morphometric data to evaluate the associations between observed craniometric distance matrix and different geographic design matrices reflecting distinct scenarios for the peopling of the New World using basic and partial Mantel tests. Additionally, we calculated the rate of morphological differentiation between Early and Late American samples under the different settlement scenarios and compared our findings to the predicted morphological differentiation under neutral conditions. Also, we incorporated in our analyses some variants of the classical Single Wave and Two Waves models as well as the Recurrent Gene Flow model. Our results suggest a better explanatory performance of the Recurrent Gene Flow model, and provide additional insights concerning affinities among Asian and Native American Circum-Arctic groups.

Although initially believed to be pathological, subsequent discoveries of Neanderthal remains lead femoral curvature to be considered as a derived Neanderthal feature. A recent study on Neanderthals and middle and early Upper Palaeolithic modern humans found no differences in femoral curvature, but did not consider size-corrected curvature. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to use 3D morphometric landmark and semi-landmark analysis to quantify relative femoral curvature in Neanderthals, Upper Palaeolithic and recent modern humans, and to compare adult bone curvature as part of the overall femoral morphology among these populations.Comparisons among populations were made using geometric morphometrics (3D landmarks) and standard multivariate methods. Comparative material involved all available complete femora from Neanderthal and Upper Palaeolithic modern human, archaeological (Mesolithic, Neolithic, Medieval) and recent human populations representing a wide geographical and lifestyle range. There are significant differences in the anatomy of the femur between Neanderthals and modern humans. Neanderthals have more curved femora than modern humans. Early modern humans are most similar to recent modern humans in their anatomy. Femoral curvature is a good indicator of activity level and habitual loading of the lower limb, indicating higher activity levels in Neanderthals than modern humans. These differences contradict robusticity studies and the archaeological record, and would suggest that femoral morphology, and curvature in particular, in Neanderthals may not be explained by adult behavior alone and could be the result of genetic drift, natural selection or differences in behavior during ontogeny. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Femoral curvature in Neanderthals and modern humans: A 3D geometric morphometric analysis","volume":"60","page start":"540","authors with affiliations":"De Groote, I., University College London, Department of Anthropology, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, The Natural History Museum, Palaeontology Department, London, SW7 5BD, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"35791611100;","index keywords":"archaeology; bone; curvature; geometry; Medieval; Mesolithic; morphology; morphometry; Neanderthal; Neolithic; Paleolithic; pathology; Homo sapiens","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Curvature; Geometric morphometrics; Homo sapiens; Neanderthals; Postcrania","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"De Groote I.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.09.009"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Roe D.A.","x":4828.8017578125,"y":-374.24432373046875,"id":"9215","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84971141832","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"5","year":"1964","page end":"267","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84971141832\u0026doi\u003d10.1017%2fS0079497X00015140\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003da1873e611d7d99a143a7275f1d0dceef","affiliations":"Peterhouse, Cambridge, United Kingdom","source title":"Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The British Lower and Middle Palaeolithic: Some Problems, Methods of Study and Preliminary Results","volume":"30","page start":"245","authors with affiliations":"Roe, D.A., Peterhouse, Cambridge, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"8733223000;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Roe D.A.","doi":"10.1017/S0079497X00015140"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Bruner E., Manzi G., Arsuaga J.L.","x":82.01029205322266,"y":-4845.76318359375,"id":"8696","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0347364653","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"26","year":"2003","page end":"15340","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0347364653\u0026doi\u003d10.1073%2fpnas.2536671100\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d0392781026bee9c8f6342bc5f032ecd9","affiliations":"Dipto. di Biol.

It is widely recognized that a considerable endocranial expansion occurred throughout the evolution of the genus Homo. This article aims to evaluate whether this phenomenon was the outcome of distinct evolutionary lineages, reaching similar brain expansions but through different trajectories. Endocranial morphology was studied in a sample of fossil hominines by multivariate approaches using both traditional metrics and geometric morphometrics. The analysis was focused on the transition from a generalized archaic pattern within the genus Homo to the modern morphology and compared with changes that occurred along the Neandertal lineage. The main result was the identification of two different evolutionary trajectories, in which a similar expansion in endocranial size has been reached by different changes in shape. Along the Neandertal lineage we observed maintenance of an \"archaic\" endocranial model, in which a large amount of variability is based on a single allometric trend. By contrast, when modern endocasts were compared with nonmodern ones, we found important differences apparently led by a parietal expansion. In this light, the origin of our species may have represented the opportunity to surpass the constraints imposed on encephalization by the ontogenetic pattern shared by nonmodern Homo representatives.","source":"Scopus","title":"Encephalization and allometric trajectories in the genus Homo: Evidence from the Neandertal and modern lineages","volume":"100","page start":"15335","authors with affiliations":"Bruner, E., Dipto. di Biol.

The least complicated hypothesis is that they were intended to arm hunting weapons. It has also been argued that they were produced for use in rituals or in connection with costly signaling displays. Lastly, it has been suggested that some cached Clovis points may have been used as saws. Here we report a study in which we morphometrically compared Clovis points from caches with Clovis points recovered from kill and camp sites to test two predictions of the hypothesis that cached Clovis points were intended to arm hunting weapons: 1) cached points should be the same shape as, but generally larger than, points from kill/camp sites, and 2) cached points and points from kill/camp sites should follow the same allometric trajectory.

This paper presents the results of applying 2D geometric morphometric analysis to the flake assemblages in the archaeological collections from the O and M levels of the Abric Romaní rock-shelter and from materials produced by experimental knapping. The results reveal a pattern of core configuration in the Levallois artefacts from level O and a high level of morphological correspondence between the core-edge flake outlines in discoid and Levallois recurrent centripetal technologies. This evidence reinforces the hypothesis that the discoid and the Levallois recurrent centripetal methods share some techno-morphological features. The knappers\u0027 ability and the purposes of the reduction sequences play important roles in metrically differentiating between them, otherwise the differences between the two methods would be even smaller.

The results of this analysis indicate gradual, progressive changes in fluted point outline shape from the Great Plains of western North America into adjacent parts of North America as well as into Central and South America. The South American \"Fishtail\" form of fluted point is seen as the culmination of incremental changes in point shape that began well into North America. A geographically gradual decline in fluting frequency also is consistent with the stylistic evolution of the stemmed \"Fishtail\" points. Although few in number, the available radiocarbon dates do suggest that \"Fishtail\" fluted points in southern South America are younger than the earliest dates associated with Clovis points in western North America.

Different criteria have been suggested for the description and classification of cut marks. The methods commonly used for the study of cut marks rely on high-cost microscopy techniques with low portability (i.e., inability to work in situ), such as the 3D digital microscope (3D DM) or laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Recently, new algorithmic developments in the field of computer vision and photogrammetry, have achieved very high precision and resolution, offering a portable and low-cost alternative to microscopic techniques. However, the photogrammetric techniques present some disadvantages, such as longer data collection and processing time, and the requirement of some photogrammetric expertise for the calibration of the cameras and the acquisition of precise image orientation. In this paper, we compare two low-cost techniques and their application to cut mark studies: the micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) technique presented, developed, and validated previously, and a methodology based on the use of a structured light scanner (SLS). A total of 47 experimental cut marks, produced using a stainless steel knife, were analyzed.

It aims to establish the extent to which the distinctive features of adult representatives of these populations are present in the early post natal period and to what extent population differences in ontogenetic scaling and allometric trajectories contribute to distinct facial forms. The analyses utilize configurations of facial landmarks and are carried out using geometric morphometric methods. The results of this study show that modern human populations can be distinguished based on facial shape alone, irrespective of age or sex, indicating the early presence of differences. Additionally, some populations have statistically distinct facial ontogenetic trajectories that lead to the development of further differences later in ontogeny. We conclude that population-specific facial morphologies develop principally through distinctions in facial shape probably already present at birth and further accentuated and modified to variable degrees during growth. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the plasticity of facial growth patterns in modern humans. Further, they have important implications in relation to the study of growth in the face of fossil hominins and in relation to the possibility of developing effective discriminant functions for the identification of population affinities of immature facial skeletal material. Such tools would be of value in archaeological, forensic and anthropological applications.

Bilaterally symmetric specimens were created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating the types. The results show that the base configurations were best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife allocation tests. The entire point shape was less robust due to the variability in blade shape. The study demonstrates that the three point types can be rigorously defined in ways that are usable in daily archaeological practice, and that base shape, rather than the entire shape, is a better discriminator.

Since its synonimization into Homo, views of the species and its distribution have varied from a single, widely dispersed, polytypic species ultimately ancestral to all later Homo, to a derived, regional isolate ultimately marginal to later hominin evolution. A revised chronostratigraphic framework and recent work bearing either directly or indirectly on reconstructions of life-history patterns are reviewed here and, together with a review of the cranial and postcranial anatomy of H. erectus, are used to generate a natural history of the species. Here I argue that H. erectus is a hominin, notable for its increased body size, that originates in the latest Pliocene/earliest Pleistocene of Africa and quickly disperses into Western and Eastern Asia. It is also an increasingly derived hominin with several regional morphs sustained by intermittent isolation, particularly in Southeast Asia. This view differs from several current views, most especially that which recognizes only a single hominin species in the Pleistocene, H. sapiens, and those which would atomize H. erectus into a multiplicity of taxa. Following Jolly ([2001] Yrbk Phys Anthropol 44:177-204), the regional morphs of H. erectus may be productively viewed as geographically replacing allotaxa, rather than as the focus of unresolvable species debates. Such a view allows us to focus on the adaptations and biology of local groups, including questions of biogeographic isolation and local adaptation. A number of issues remain unresolved, including the significance of diversity in size and shape in the early African and Georgian records. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Natural History of Homo erectus","volume":"122","page start":"126","authors with affiliations":"Antón, S.C., Department of Anthropology, New York University, New York, NY 10003, United States, Department of Anthropology, New York University, 25 Waverly Place, New York, NY 10003, United States","author(s) id":"7005809473;","index keywords":"anatomical variation; anatomy; biodiversity; biogeographic region; chronosequence; evolution; evolutionary adaptation; geographic distribution; history; hominid; homo erectus; human; life history; Pliocene; review; stratigraphy; Homo erectus; Homo sapiens; Pithecanthropus","document type":"Review","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Africa; China; Dispersal; H. ergaster; Indonesia; Life history","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Antón S.C.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.10399"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"McPherron S.P.","x":4595.66455078125,"y":-646.0829467773438,"id":"9242","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33645050317","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.012371134020618556","Modularity Class":"5","year":"1999","page end":"32","source title":"Préhistoire Européenne","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Ovate and pointed handaxe assemblages: two points make a line","volume":"14","page start":"9","authors with affiliations":"McPherron, S.P.","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"6.0","authors":"McPherron S.P."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":29.279998779296875},{"label":"Bookstein F.L.","x":-781.1697387695312,"y":730.0170288085938,"id":"9173","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0031107378","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.04536082474226804","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"3","year":"1997","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0031107378\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fS1361-8415%2897%2985012-8\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d13e7bb81c1f834c67647b53d0eefa883","affiliations":"Institute of Gerontology, University of Michigan, 300 North Ingalls Building, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2007, United States","source title":"Medical Image Analysis","abstract":"Morphometrics, a new branch of statistics, combines tools from geometry, computer graphics and biometrics in techniques for the multivariate analysis of biological shape variation. Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.","source":"Scopus","title":"Landmark methods for forms without landmarks: Morphometrics of group differences in outline shape","volume":"1","authors with affiliations":"Bookstein, F.L., Institute of Gerontology, University of Michigan, 300 North Ingalls Building, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2007, United States","author(s) id":"7004606384;","index keywords":"algorithm; article; corpus callosum; histology; human; image processing; methodology; multivariate analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; schizophrenia; statistics; Algorithms; Corpus Callosum; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multivariate Analysis; Schizophrenia","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Morphometrics; Multivariate analysis; Outlines; Procrustes analysis; Thin-plate spline","pr_indegree":"22.0","authors":"Bookstein F.L.","doi":"10.1016/S1361-8415(97)85012-8"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":91.36000061035156},{"label":"Mounier A., Marchal F., Condemi S.","x":-103.48298645019531,"y":-3188.505615234375,"id":"9188","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-61849141216","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","Modularity Class":"4","year":"2009","page end":"246","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-61849141216\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jhevol.2008.12.006\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003da93ffab10006dd01fe2dce9c0e908d69","affiliations":"Unité d\u0027Anthropologie: Adaptabilité Bioculturelle, UMR 6578, CNRS, Université de la Méditerranée, Boulevard Pierre Dramard, 13344 Marseille Cedex 15, France","source title":"Journal of Human Evolution","abstract":"The discovery of new fossils in Africa, Asia, and Europe, and the recognition of a greater diversity in the middle Pleistocene fossil record, has led to a reconsideration of the species Homo heidelbergensis. This nomen, formulated by Schoetensack in 1908 to describe the Mauer jaw (Germany), was almost forgotten during most of the past century. Numerous fossils have been attributed to it but no consensus has arisen concerning their classification. The holotype anatomical traits are still poorly understood, and numerous fossils with no mandibular remains have been placed in the taxon. Some researchers propose H. heidelbergensis as an Afro-European taxon that is ancestral to both modern humans and Neandertals whereas others think it is a strictly European species that is part of the Neandertal lineage. We focus on the validity of H. heidelbergensis, using the traditional basis of species recognition: anatomical description. We provide a comparative morphological analysis using 47 anatomical traits of 36 Pleistocene fossils from Africa, Asia, and Europe and 35 extant human mandibles. We re-examine the mandibular features of Mauer and discuss the specimen\u0027s inclusion in H. heidelbergensis, as well as alternative evolutionary theories. To lend objectivity to specimen grouping, we use multiple correspondence analysis associated with hierarchical classification that creates clusters corresponding to phenetic similarities between jaws. Our phenetic and comparative morphological analyses support the validity of H. heidelbergensis as a taxon. A set of morphological features can be statistically identified for the definition of the species. Some traits can be used to delimit H. heidelbergensis in an evolutionary framework (e.g., foramina mentale posteriorly positioned, horizontal retromolar surface). Those traits are also present on African (e.g., Tighenif) and European (e.g., Sima de los Huesos) specimens that show a close relationship with the Mauer mandible. Therefore, the definition of H. heidelbergensis is more precise and mainly supports the theory of an Afro-European taxon, which is the last common ancestor of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. However, the results of this study fail to entirely discount the hypothesis that considers H. heidelbergensis as a chronospecies leading to the Neandertals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although cladistically derived trees are only hypotheses about phylogeny, they are superior both to trees created through phenetics, which employs characters without regard as to whether they are analogous or homologous, and to trees created by using undifferentiated homologous characters. To date, cladistics is an unused approach to constructing archaeological phylogenies but one that holds considerable potential for resolving some of archaeology’s historical problems. For example, it has long been noted that the southeastern United States exhibits the greatest diversity in fluted-point forms in North America-an observation that prompted Mason (1962) to propose that fluted points originated in the Southeast and then spread to other areas. However, because of a paucity of such points from well-dated contexts in the Southeast, it is difficult to ascertain chronological, let alone phylogenetic, relations among the various forms. Evolutionary trees derived from cladistical analysis are testable hypotheses about those phylogenetic relations. © 2001 Academi Press.","source":"Scopus","title":"Cladistics is useful for reconstructing archaeological phylogenies: Palaeoindian points from the Southeastern United States","volume":"28","page start":"1115","authors with affiliations":"O’Brien, M.J., Department of Anthropology, 107 Swallow Hall, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, United States; Darwent, J., Department of Anthropology, 107 Swallow Hall, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, United States; Lyman, R.L., Department of Anthropology, 107 Swallow Hall, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, United States","author(s) id":"57188629943;6506853914;57203868775;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; cladistics; material culture; phylogeny; trade flow; United States","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Cladistics; Cultural transmission; Derived characters; Phylogenetic trees","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"O’Brien M.J., Darwent J., Lyman R.L.","doi":"10.1006/jasc.2001.0681"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Peres-Neto P.R., Jackson D.A.","x":954.8792724609375,"y":55.763916015625,"id":"8848","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0034782527","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"2","issue":"2","year":"2001","page end":"178","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0034782527\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs004420100720\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d9f675cc318b843beb85e12df7d5f3e81","affiliations":"Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.

Canonical variate analysis (CVA), the generalization of LDA for multiple groups, is often used in the exploratory style of an ordination technique (a low-dimensional representation of the data). In the rare case when all groups have the same covariance matrix, maximum likelihood classification can be based on these linear functions. Both LDA and CVA require full-rank covariance matrices, which is usually not the case in modern morphometrics. When the number of variables is close to the number of individuals, groups appear separated in a CVA plot even if they are samples from the same population. Hence, reliable classification and assessment of group separation require many more organisms than variables. A simple alternative to CVA is the projection of the data onto the principal components of the group averages (between-group PCA). In contrast to CVA, these axes are orthogonal and can be computed even when the data are not of full rank, such as for Procrustes shape coordinates arising in samples of any size, and when covariance matrices are heterogeneous. In evolutionary quantitative genetics, the selection gradient is identical to the coefficient vector of a linear discriminant function between the populations before vs. after selection. When the measured variables are Procrustes shape coordinates, discriminant functions and selection gradients are vectors in shape space and can be visualized as shape deformations. Except for applications in quantitative genetics and in classification, however, discriminant functions typically offer no interpretation as biological factors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","source":"Scopus","title":"Linear Discrimination, Ordination, and the Visualization of Selection Gradients in Modern Morphometrics","volume":"38","page start":"100","authors with affiliations":"Mitteroecker, P., Department of Theoretical Biology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1091 Vienna, Austria; Bookstein, F., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1091 Vienna, Austria, Department of Statistics, University of Washington, Padelford B-207, Seattle, WA 98195-4322, United States","author(s) id":"6507135382;7004606384;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Canonical variate analysis; Linear discriminant function; Ordination; Principal component analysis; Procrustes; Selection gradient","pr_indegree":"6.0","authors":"Mitteroecker P., Bookstein F.","doi":"10.1007/s11692-011-9109-8"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":29.279998779296875},{"label":"Bookstein F.L.","x":-341.625732421875,"y":-2370.66552734375,"id":"8926","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0000317182","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","Modularity Class":"4","year":"1996","page end":"151","source title":"Advances in Morphometrics","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Combining the tools of geometric morphometrics","page start":"131","authors with affiliations":"Bookstein, F.L.","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Bookstein F.L."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Eren M.I., Lycett S.J., Roos C.I., Sampson C.G.","x":3644.46484375,"y":3706.11767578125,"id":"8401","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-80051799865","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"10","year":"2011","page end":"2739","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-80051799865\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2011.06.011\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d9388f8a1e54cae4d0f443c3896b20816","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University, Heroy Building (ISEM), Dallas, TX 75275 0336, United States; Department of Anthropology, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom; Department of Anthropology, Texas State University, United States","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Lithic raw material constraints are widely assumed to be a determining factor of flaked stone tool morphology, but this assumption remains largely untested.

The symmetrical, bifluted form allowed a split, facial-contact haft to extend nearly to the tip, thereby controlling both location and extent of fracture and allowing many cycles of point reworking. Extreme thinnes achieved by fluting facilitated leading edge sharpness for enhanced penetration. The near-constant cross-section from tip to base meant no loss of leading edge acuteness upon resharpening and inter-changeability of broken segments. The high-friction, forwardly adjustable haft assured firm mounting even with shortened, reused point segments. This efficient design was critical for groups who spent weeks and maybe months away from raw material sources in pursuit of game. Short, exhausted Folsom points or \u0027slugs\u0027 are what archaeologists most commonly find and study. In contrast, a quite long, fully fluted point made from a yet longer preform was the intended product of the Folsom knapper. The model presented here can be tested through study of preform length, finished point proportions, fracture patterns, haft element features, and use-wear analysis in archaeological specimens, as well as actualistic hunting experiments. The engine driving persistent use of snap blade, full fluted projectile technology was focused commitment to a single, highly mobile game species (bison). This specific technofunctional element in Folsom culture reveals a weapon system designed to mitigate against extreme risk regarding access to raw material. Continuing research should demonstrate that the appearance, geographic distribution, persistence, and disappearance of the Folsom fluted point relate closely to juxtapositions of climatic change, biotic change, and human population movements that occurred near the end of the Pleistocene.

In contrast to most other tropical regions, permanent settlement in Australian rainforests developed much later, and in the absence of adjacent agricultural economies. Here we explore how the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland were exploited during the late Holocene through an ancient starch and phytolith record spanning the last 2000 years. Sequences at the two sites under study – Urumbal Pocket (a ‘Eucalyptus pocket’ surrounded by rainforest) and Goddard Creek (within the rainforest) – indicate a human presence since the early Holocene, coincident with the re-establishment of rainforest in the region. Toxic starchy nuts and the associated complex processing underpinned permanent settlement. Using a geometric morphometric approach to starch analysis, a range of economic starch producing plant species were identified including Endiandra palmerstonii, E. insignis, Lasjia whelani and Beilschmiedia bancroftii in the Urumbal pocket sequence. The phytolith record shows that Urumbal Pocket has been a ‘Eucalyptus pocket’ for at least the last 2000 years, the open nature of the vegetation maintained by regular burning. Goddard Creek, on the other hand has been closed forest, with a changing profile as fire was used more frequently over time.

J. Phys. Anthropol. 79:253-267; Kohn et al. [1993] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 90:147-158). It can be argued that diverging observations partly result from methodological constraints. The present study compares samples of intentionally deformed and undeformed human crania, using elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA), a morphometric approach which has been shown to be particularly appropriate for characterizing the shape of two-dimensional outlines and associated shape changes. We improve the standard EFA approach by adding a preliminary orientation of the outlines following the rotation parameters of a Procrustes superimposition, using multiple homologous landmarks called control points. The results confirm that circumferentially deformed skulls exhibit modifications of the basioccipital region, together with increased anterior and inferior facial projection. However, the degree to which basioccipital flattening is modified in circumferentially deformed Peruvians was found to be less marked than changes observed in the face. Some of the modifications observed here can be related to morphological trends existing in the population from which our sample was taken. The observation of other modifications may be subject to methodological constraints of standard morphometric approaches. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Exploring artificial cranial deformation using elliptic fourier analysis of procrustes aligned outlines","volume":"122","page start":"11","authors with affiliations":"Frieß, M., New York Consortium Evol.

Here, we address that deficiency by using data from a sample of Folsom and Clovis points recovered from sites across the western United States. We used geometric morphometric techniques to capture point shape and then conducted statistical analyses of variability associated with Clovis and Folsom point bases and blades. Our results demonstrate that Folsom bases and blades are less variable than those on earlier Clovis points, indicating an increase in point standardization during the Early Paleoindian period. In addition, despite published claims to the contrary, Clovis and Folsom point bases are no more variable than blades. Based on these results, we conducted additional analyses to examine the modularity and size of Clovis and Folsom points. The results suggest Clovis points have more integrated base and blade segments than Folsom points. We suggest that several classes of Clovis points - intended for different functions - might have been in use during the Clovis period and that the later Folsom points might have served only as weapon tips, the shape of which were constrained by the fluting process.

However, the domestication process remains largely unknown. Crucial unanswered questions concern the duration of the process (rapid or slow?) and the related geographical area (single or multiple-origins?). Seeds from domesticated grapevine and from its wild ancestor are reported to differ according to shape. Our work aims, first, to confirm this difference and secondly to identify the extent of domestication in the grapes cultivated by Romans in Southern France during the period 50 BCE-500 CE. We had the opportunity to analyze uncharred waterlogged grape pips from 17 archaeological sites. Based on an extended reference sample of modern wild grapevines and cultivars our work shows that both subspecies can be discriminated using simple measurements. The elongation gradient of the pip\u0027s body and stalk may be regarded as an indicator of the strength of the selection pressures undergone by domesticated grapes. Grapevines cultivated during the Roman period included a mix of morphotypes comprising wild, intermediate and moderately selected domesticated forms. Our data point to a relative shift towards more selected types during the Roman period. Domestication of the grapevine appears to have been a slow process. This could result from the recurrent incorporation into cultivation of plants originating from sexual reproduction, when grape cultivation essentially relies on vegetative propagation. © 2013 Bouby et al.","source":"Scopus","title":"Bioarchaeological Insights into the Process of Domestication of Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) during Roman Times in Southern France","volume":"8","authors with affiliations":"Bouby, L., CNRS, Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie (CBAE), UMR 5059, Montpellier, France; Figueiral, I., INRAP Méditerranée, Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie (CBAE), UMR 5059, Montpellier, France; Bouchette, A., INRAP Méditerranée, Archéologie des Sociétés Méditerranéennes (ASM), UMR 5140, Lattes, France; Rovira, N., Université Montpellier 3, Archéologie des Sociétés Méditerranéennes (ASM), UMR 5140, Lattes, France; Ivorra, S., CNRS, Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie (CBAE), UMR 5059, Montpellier, France; Lacombe, T., INRA, Equipe Diversité et Adaptation de la Vigne et des Espèces Méditerraneennes, UMR AGAP, Montpellier SupAgro, Montpellier, France; Pastor, T., Université Montpellier 2, Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie (CBAE), UMR 5059, Montpellier, France; Picq, S., INRA, Equipe Diversité et Adaptation de la Vigne et des Espèces Méditerraneennes, UMR AGAP, Montpellier SupAgro, Montpellier, France, Université Montpellier 2, Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie (CBAE), UMR 5059, Montpellier, France; Marinval, P., CNRS, Archéologie des Sociétés Méditerranéennes (ASM), UMR 5140, Lattes, France; Terral, J.-F., Université Montpellier 2, Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie (CBAE), UMR 5059, Montpellier, France","author(s) id":"6602374494;6603067806;6505820481;56585834500;14828273200;23485802300;36128801200;36091924200;7801592623;6603580109;","index keywords":"archeology; article; bioarcheology; controlled study; cultivar; cultural anthropology; domestication; France; genetic selection; grape; morphotype; nonhuman; plant stem; plant structures; species cultivation; species difference; vegetative propagation; wild type; Archaeology; Crops, Agricultural; France; Vitis","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Bouby L., Figueiral I., Bouchette A., Rovira N., Ivorra S., Lacombe T., Pastor T., Picq S., Marinval P., Terral J.-F.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0063195"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Franco N.V., Castro A., Cardillo M., Charlin J.","x":-991.4348754882812,"y":4096.90283203125,"id":"8476","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77951202640","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.010309278350515464","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"1","year":"2009","page end":"112","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-77951202640\u0026doi\u003d10.4067%2fS0718-22442009000100008\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d890bed615241f92e2c79775f5c5087ce","affiliations":"Universidad de Buenos Aries, Saavedra 15, 5to. piso, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (C.P. 1083), Argentina; Universidad de La Plata, Paseo del Bosque S/N., La Plata (C.P. 1900), Pcia.

Here, we present a multivariate morphometric analysis in order to more fully document how Mid-Pleistocene (i.e. ~803 Kyr) handaxes from Bose Basin, China compare to examples from the west, as well as with additional (Mode 1) cores from across the Old World. Results show that handaxes from both the western Old World and Bose are significantly different from the Mode 1 cores, suggesting a gross comparability with regard to functionally-related form. Results also demonstrate overlap between the ranges of shape variation in Acheulean handaxes and those from Bose, demonstrating that neither raw material nor cognitive factors were an absolute impediment to Bose hominins in making comparable handaxe forms to their hominin kin west of the Movius Line. However, the shapes of western handaxes are different from the Bose examples to a statistically significant degree. Moreover, the handaxe assemblages from the western Old World are all more similar to each other than any individual assemblage is to the Bose handaxes. Variation in handaxe form is also comparatively high for the Bose material, consistent with suggestions that they represent an emergent, convergent instance of handaxe technology authored by Pleistocene hominins with cognitive capacities directly comparable to those of \u0027Acheulean\u0027 hominins. © 2012 Wang et al.","source":"Scopus","title":"Comparison of handaxes from Bose Basin (china) and the western Acheulean indicates convergence of form, not cognitive differences","volume":"7","authors with affiliations":"Wang, W., Guangxi Museum of Nationalities, Nanning, China; Lycett, S.J., Department of Anthropology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom; von Cramon-Taubadel, N., Department of Anthropology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom; Jin, J.J.H., Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, Central Identification Lab (JPAC-CIL), Hickam AFB, HI, United States, Department of Anthropology, University of Hawai\u0027i at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, United States; Bae, C.J., Department of Anthropology, University of Hawai\u0027i at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, United States","author(s) id":"56920780300;9434693200;23471109300;35208537700;36602128100;","index keywords":"article; artifact; China; cognition; controlled study; cultural anthropology; geometry; handaxe; Middle Pleistocene; morphometrics; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; Stone Age; animal; archeology; cluster analysis; cognition; comparative study; history; hominid; multivariate analysis; nonparametric test; psychological aspect; tool use; Animals; Archaeology; China; Cluster Analysis; Cognition; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Multivariate Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tool Use Behavior","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"e35804","pr_indegree":"8.0","authors":"Wang W., Lycett S.J., von Cramon-Taubadel N., Jin J.J.H., Bae C.J.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0035804"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":37.040000915527344},{"label":"Thompson D.W.","x":2780.91650390625,"y":-1257.436279296875,"id":"8760","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003720769","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","authors with affiliations":"Thompson, D.W.","Modularity Class":"6","year":"1917","source title":"On Growth and Form","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"3.0","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Thompson D.W."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Braga J., Treil J.","x":-90.87811279296875,"y":-1556.5478515625,"id":"7968","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-35348882661","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"6","year":"2007","page end":"443","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-35348882661\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs00414-007-0170-x\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d7e6ef12bc4dd4fb237e2cfb5fc7ad140","affiliations":"Centre d\u0027Anthropobiologie, Université Paul Sabatier, FRE 2960 CNRS, 39, allées Jules Guesde, 31000 Toulouse, France","source title":"International Journal of Legal Medicine","abstract":"This paper presents a method for estimating the skeletal age of children based on the centroid size of their face and their basicranium, derived from the three-dimensional coordinates of anatomical landmarks.

We examined the relationship between the chronological age and the centroid size, calculated by using geometric morphometric methods and a linear model. With the aid of cross-validations, the statistical analysis indicates that the centroid size of the facial skeleton can be used an age-related variable without any loss of accuracy with increased age, contrary to most of the methods of pediatric age estimation.

Recently, a phylogenetic survey has shown that the non-commensal mouse of Cyprus was an unknown sister species of European wild mice. Here, we describe this new species of the genus Mus (Rodentia, Mammalia), namely Mus cypriacus sp. n., based on 19 specimens trapped in the southern part of Cyprus. These animals were first compared to Eurasian species of mice using both molecular genet-ics (complete D-loop sequences and nuclear gene intron) and cytogenetics to state on its systematic status. Then classical and geometric morphometric analyses on both cranial and dental characters have been performed to compare Mus cypriacus with circum-Mediterranean species and provide diagnositic morphological characters. Genetic data strongly support a sister species relationship of the new species to M. macedonicus, the closest mainland taxon. Morphometric analyses provide satisfying criteria for diagnosis of this species relative to other Mediterranean species. The most obvious phenotypic characteristics are its long tail and the allometric gigantism and shape robustness of its cranial and dental characters compared to other Mediterranean mice. The molecular clock and the history of the murine settlement on Cyprus are congruent and suggest that the common ancestor of M. cypriacus and M. macedonicus arrived on Cyprus during the Middle Pleistocene by a founder event on natural raft. The remoteness of Cyprus through time has prevented introgression from the mainland gene pool, and favoured phenotypic adaptation to competition release, leading to the allopatric speciation of M. cypriacus.

Artificially deformed skulls display marked alterations of the cranial base. This study evaluates mandibular changes as function of the morphology of the cranial base in these skulls. Material and methods: A geometric morphometric study was performed on lateral cephalometric X-rays of three groups of skulls: 32 with anteroposterior deformity, 17 with circumferential deformity and 39 with no apparent deformity. Results: In artificially deformed skulls, the cranial base was deformed causing the mandibular condyle to be in a more anterior position. There was a complete remodelling of the mandible involving narrowing and elongation of the mandibular ramus, rotation of the corpus of the mandible and increased vertical height of the symphysis. Forward displacement did not occur. Integration between mandible and cranial base is not altered by deformation of the skull. Conclusions: Deformity of the cranial vault exerts an influence on the mandible, supporting the theory of modular units in complete integration. This also supports the theory that mandibular prognathism is a multifactorial result and not a direct effect of displacement of the cranial base. © 2016 John Wiley \u0026 Sons A/S.

We present a comparison of the expression of lower molar dental traits (cusp 6, cusp 7, trigonid crest pattern, and protostylid) at the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) in a variety of extant and fossil hominoid taxa, in order to assess the contribution of the EDJ to the morphology of these traits at the outer enamel surface (OES). Molars (n \u003d 44) were imaged nondestructively using high-resolution microCT, and three-dimensional surface models of the EDJ and OES were created to compare trait expression at each surface. Our results indicate that these dental traits originate at the EDJ, and that the EDJ is primarily responsible for their degree of expression at the OES. Importantly, variable trait morphology at the EDJ (often not easily recognizable at the OES) indicates that different developmental processes can produce traits that appear similar at the enamel surface, suggesting caution in intra- and intertaxonomic comparisons. The results also highlight the importance of the EDJ for understanding the morphological development of discrete traits, and for establishing graded scales of variation to compare trait frequency among groups for the purpose of taxonomic and/or phylogenetic analysis.

The model is tested using exocranial and radiographic measurements of adult crania sampled from five geographically and craniometrically diverse populations. The results indicate that while variations in the breadth, length and flexion of the cranial base are mutually independent, only the maximum breadth of the cranial base (POB) has significant effects on overall cranial proportions, largely through its interactions with brain volume which influence NBC breadth. These interactions also have a slight influence on facial shape because NBC width constrains facial width, and because narrow-faced individuals tend to have antero-posteriorly longer faces relative to facial breadth than wide-faced individuals. Finally, the model highlights how integration between the cranial base and the brain may help to account for the developmental basis of some morphological variations such as occipital bunning. Among modern humans, the degree of posterior projection of the occipital bone appears to be a consequence of having a large brain on a relatively narrow cranial base. Occipital buns in Neanderthals, who have wide cranial bases relative to endocranial volume, may not be entirely homologous with the morphology occasionally evident in Homo sapiens.","source":"Scopus","title":"Basicranial influence on overall cranial shape","volume":"38","page start":"291","authors with affiliations":"Lieberman, D.E., Department of Anthropology, George Washington University, 2110 G St, NW, Washington, DC 20052, United States, Human Origins Program, National Museum of National History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC 20560, United States; Pearson, O.M., Department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, United States; Mowbray, K.M., Department of Anthropology, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th, New York, NY 10024, United States","author(s) id":"7202460412;7006231212;6602804788;","index keywords":"morphometry; skull; Crania; Hominidae; Hominidae; Homo sapiens; Primates","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Basicranium; Cranium; Integration; Neurocranium; Occipital bun; Skull","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Lieberman D.E., Pearson O.M., Mowbray K.M.","doi":"10.1006/jhev.1999.0335"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Mounier A., Correia M., Rivera F., Crivellaro F., Power R., Jeffery J., Wilshaw A., Foley R.A., Mirazón Lahr M.","x":215.2919158935547,"y":-2958.071044921875,"id":"2854","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85047506744","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"4","year":"2018","page end":"253","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85047506744\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jhevol.2018.04.013\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dca7856ef61b5db8ba7236a8bfcb4126d","affiliations":"UMR 7194, CNRS-Muséum National D\u0027Histoire Naturelle, Musée de L\u0027Homme, 17 Place Du Trocadéro et Du 11 Novembre, Paris, 75016, France; Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies, Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Street, Cambridge, CB2 1QH, United Kingdom; Department of Ancient History, Macquarie University, Level 5, W6A BuildingNSW  2109, Australia; Turkana Basin Institute, Kenya","source title":"Journal of Human Evolution","abstract":"Africa is the birthplace of the species Homo sapiens, and Africans today are genetically more diverse than other populations of the world. However, the processes that underpinned the evolution of African populations remain largely obscure. Only a handful of late Pleistocene African fossils (∼50-12 Ka) are known, while the more numerous sites with human fossils of early Holocene age are patchily distributed. In particular, late Pleistocene and early Holocene human diversity in Eastern Africa remains little studied, precluding any analysis of the potential factors that shaped human diversity in the region, and more broadly throughout the continent. These periods include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a moment of extreme aridity in Africa that caused the fragmentation of population ranges and localised extinctions, as well as the ‘African Humid Period’ a moment of abrupt climate change and enhanced connectivity throughout Africa. East Africa, with its range of environments, may have acted as a refugium during the LGM, and may have played a critical biogeographic role during the heterogene’ous environmental recovery that followed. This environmental context raises a number of questions about the relationships among early Holocene African populations, and about the role played by East Africa in shaping late hunter-gatherer biological diversity. Here, we describe eight mandibles from Nataruk, an early Holocene site (∼10 Ka) in West Turkana, offering the opportunity of exploring population diversity in Africa at the height of the ‘African Humid Period’. We use 3D geometric morphometric techniques to analyze the phenotypic variation of a large mandibular sample. Our results show that (i) the Nataruk mandibles are most similar to other African hunter-fisher-gatherer populations, especially to the fossils from Lothagam, another West Turkana locality, and to other early Holocene fossils from the Central Rift Valley (Kenya); and (ii) a phylogenetic connection may have existed between these Eastern African populations and some Nile Valley and Maghrebian groups, who lived at a time when a Green Sahara may have allowed substantial contact, and potential gene flow, across a vast expanse of Northern and Eastern Africa. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"Who were the Nataruk people?

Shape and size of the naturally available raw material blocks have been cited as key factors in determining Acheulian biface blank production technology as well as tool morphological variability. In other words, where large blocks of raw material were available (Africa), large flakes were produced, and where only smaller cobbles and nodules were to be found (Europe), they become the primary type of blank used. In this paper, I explore a large body of data collected from Acheulian sites from India to Morocco and from South Africa to England to test this common premise. Different raw material exploitation patterns as reflected in the bifacial tools in the various assemblages are described and analyzed. The results indicate that in large flake based Acheulian assemblages, raw material constraints did not significantly affect either the blank production process or large cutting tool shape and size variability. The Acheulian large cutting toolmakers used the rock types available in the vicinity of their site in a sophisticated reduction sequence aimed to produce large cutting tools that are surprisingly similar regardless of the original shape, size and type of raw material from which they were produced. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To clarify how and when these differences arise in ontogeny, we studied ontogenetic trajectories for Honto sapiens, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla and Pongo pygmaeus. A total of 96 traditional three-dimensional landmarks and semilandmarks on the face and cranial base were collected on 268 adult and sub-adult crania for a geometric morphometric analysis. The ontogenetic trajectories are compared by various techniques, including a new method, relative warps in size-shape space. We find that adult Homo sapiens specimens are clearly separated from the great apes in shape space and size-shape space. Around birth, Homo sapiens infants are already markedly different from the great apes, which overlap at this age but diverge among themselves postnatally. The results suggest that the small genetic differences between Homo and Pan affect early human ontogeny to induce the distinct adult human craniofacial morphology. Pure heterochrony does not sufficiently explain the human craniofacial morphology nor the differences among the African apes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, from the earliest commentaries on the Victoria West, it has frequently been thought of as a \u0027large Levallois\u0027 variant. The hypothesis that VW cores are accurately characterised as \u0027large Levallois\u0027 is tested here using a comparative 3D geometric morphometric (GM) methodology. GM methods are powerful statistical tools for shape analysis that offer many advantages over traditional means of shape quantification and comparison. The use of landmarks to capture shape variation allows for the preservation of the full geometry, as well as enabling the more precise description of shape versus size. Moreover, biological studies have shown that the use of landmarks allows for a flexible approach to comparing specific aspects of overall morphology. Here, we employ GM to analyse differences in core surface morphology in a range of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, including Victoria West examples (total n \u003d 639 artefacts). In comparison with cores from non-handaxe Mode 1, Acheulean handaxes, and Levallois cores, the Victoria West share shape affinities with both Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores. However, when compared directly with a group of large Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores from Baker\u0027s Hole (UK), the Victoria West were found to more closely resemble handaxes, while the Baker\u0027s Hole set are simply isometrically-scaled Levallois cores. These analyses show that, despite broad technological and qualitative morphological similarities with Levallois cores, Victoria West cores are morphologically more similar to Lower Palaeolithic artefact forms, such as handaxes, and are in some respects distinct from Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores. In line with other recent analyses, our results support suggestions that the Victoria West technique is an extension of longstanding Acheulean traditions for the preparation of biface blanks, but with its own distinct characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As the three-dimensional morphology of the temporal bone, upper face, basicranium, and entire cranium appear to consistently reflect genetic relationships in humans, especially with more reliability than the cranial vault, it would be preferable to focus on these regions when attempting to determine the genetic relationships of human specimens with no molecular data. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Which cranial regions reflect molecular distances reliably in humans?

Presented here is a novel application of a three-dimensional landmark based geometric morphometric approach to address the nature of long distance trade and connectivity on the prehistoric Silk Road. The similarity of Bronze and Iron Age archaeological cultures along this steppe route has encouraged characterisations of these people as nomads, with highly mobile, integrated, and connected human and animal populations. However, the interconnectedness of domestic animal populations, in particular sheep (Ovis aries), the foundation of this prehistoric pastoral economy, has never been examined. This study utilized geometric morphometric methods to quantify geometric morphometric variance of O. aries astragali between three geographically disparate settlement sites within a single Final Bronze age cultural and chronological context. Significant differences between morphotypes revealed that protracted mobility patterns were unlikely and that while animal exchange may have occurred, it was not pervasive enough to produce a uniform sheep morphotype across central and southeastern Kazakhstan.

A sequence of projectile point types was established according to their changes in size and shape. These stone tools, along with others cultural evidences, sensed to differentiate a series of \"cultural periods,\" which were, for decades, the frame of reference to understand the cultural evolution in southernmost Patagonia. Although later researches have questioned several of these assumptions, the classical typology of projectile points continued in use until the present day. The goal of this work is to evaluate size and shape variation in two late Holocene projectile point types, known as Fell. Bird, or Magallanes IV and V points or Patagónicas and Ona points, respectively. These two types are compared using geometric morphometries and multivariate statistical analyses. The reliability in the discrimination between types is tested at the light of reduction. The analyses have shown a major incidence of reduction on shape rather than on size, and on blade rather than on stem. However, in average, types IV and V can be distinguished in terms of size, and stem shape despite reduction. Thus, even though successive cycles of use, damage and resharpening have a great influence over size and shape of projectile points, resharpening techniques are specific enough to maintain the differences of size and shape between types, a pattern that is probably related with functional requirements.

The experiments use the isotropic error model, which assumes equal and independent variation at each landmark. The case of three landmarks in the plane (i.e., triangles) was emphasized because it could be investigated systematically and the results displayed on the printed page. The amount of error in the estimates was displayed as RMSE surfaces over the space of all possible configurations of three landmarks. Patterns of bias were shown as vector fields over this same space. Experiments were also performed using particular combinations of four or more landmarks in both two and three dimensions. It was found that the generalized Procrustes analysis method produced estimates with the least error and no pattern of bias. Averages of Bookstein shape coordinates performed well if the longest edge was used as the baseline. The method of moments (Stoyan, 1990, Model. Biomet. J. 32, 843) used in EDMA (Lele, 1993, Math. Geol. 25, 573) exhibits larger errors. When variation is not small, it also shows a pattern of bias for isosceles triangles with one side much shorter than the other two and for triangles whose vertices are approximately collinear causing them to resemble their own reflections. Similar problems were found for the log-distance method of Rao and Suryawanshi (1996, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 95, 4121).

Two of these samples are artificially deformed (anteroposterior [AP] and circumferential [C] types). Measurements taken from lateral radiographs demonstrated that alternative forms of the cranial base angle (N‐S‐Ba, planum angle, planum sphenoidale to plane of the clivus and PANG angle, planum sphenoidale to basion‐sella plane) and the orbital and OANG angles (orbital roof to plane of the clivus and basion‐sella plane, respectively) of both deformed groups increased while the angle S‐Ba‐O decreased significantly with respect to the undeformed (N) sample. Changes in the AP group are largely due to anteroinferior displacement of the basion‐sella plane. Similar changes in group C are amplified by this group\u0027s posterosuperior frontal migration. This migration results in a relatively shallow orbit at the orbital plate/frontal squama interface. Unlike the deformation experienced by the external vault plates, the basion‐sella plane orientation remains stable with respect to the Frankfort Horizontal. Additionally, nasal region measurements such as maximum nasal aperture breadth and nasal height were largely stable between each deformed group and the undeformed group. However, facial (bimaxillary and bizygomatic), basicranial, cranial, and frontal breadths decreased significantly from group AP to group N to group C. Thus, gross morphological facial changes between each undeformed group and the control group are largely accounted for by dimensional changes in peripheral structures. These results stress the importance of the dynamic interrelationship between the cranial vault and base in the development of the craniofacial complex.

In particular, the degree to which the three adult crania exhibit recent East Asian morphology, as well as their degree of within-group variability, has long been debated. Several early researchers described a resemblance to East Asian populations, but these findings have been for the most part rejected by more recent metric and non-metric analyses. Nevertheless, the Upper Cave specimens have not been classified conclusively into any recent modern human population to which they have been compared, and classification results differ for each cranium. Here, the question of the affinities of Upper Cave 101 and 103, the two better-preserved crania, is examined from the perspective of the Late Pleistocene human fossil record using the methodology of 3-D geometric morphometrics. The degree of morphological variation between the two specimens is also evaluated within the context of recent population variability. Neurocranial and facial morphology are analyzed separately so as to maximize comparative samples. Results show a morphological resemblance of the Upper Cave material to Upper Paleolithic Europeans. It is proposed that the Upper Cave specimens retain important aspects of modern human ancestral morphology, and possibly share a recent common ancestral population with Upper Paleolithic Europeans, in accordance with the Single Origin model of modern human origins. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Formal CT models were defined by anthropologists 30 years ago and have been a subject of active research in the social sciences in the ensuing years. Although increasing in popularity in recent years, CT has not seen extensive use in archaeological research, despite the quantitative rigor of many CT models and the ability to create testable hypotheses. Part of the reason for the slow adoption, we argue, has been the continuing focus on change in central tendency and mode in archaeology, instead of change in dispersion or variance. Yet archaeological research provides an excellent data source for exploring processes of CT. We review CT research in the anthropological sciences and outline the benefits and drawbacks of this theoretical framework for the study of material culture. We argue that CT can shed much light on our understandings of why material technology changes over time, including explanations of differential rates of change among different technologies. We further argue that transmission processes are greatly affected by the content, context, and mode of transmission and fundamentally structure variation in material culture. Including ideas from CT can provide greater context for explaining and understanding changes in the variation of artifacts over time.

We tested this model using the dental phenotype of modern and ancient common voles (Microtus arvalis), introduced onto the Orkney archipelago (Scotland) from continental Europe some 5000 years ago. First, we investigated phenotypic divergence of Orkney and continental European populations and assessed climatic influences. Second, phenotypic differentiation among Orkney populations was tested against geography, time, and neutral genetic patterns. Finally, we examined evolutionary change along a time series for the Orkney Mainland. Molar gigantism and anterior-lobe hypertrophy evolved rapidly in Orkney voles following introduction, without any transitional forms detected. Founder events and adaptation appear to explain this initial rapid evolution. Idiosyncrasy in dental features among different island populations of Orkney voles is also likely the result of local founder events following Neolithic translocation around the archipelago. However, against our initial expectations, a second marked phenotypic shift occurred between the 4th and 12th centuries AD, associated with increased pastoral farming and introduction of competitors (mice and rats) and terrestrial predators (foxes and cats). These results indicate that human agency can generate a more complex pattern of morphological evolution than might be expected in island rodents. © 2014 The Authors.","source":"Scopus","title":"The changing pace of insular life: 5000 years of microevolution in the orkney vole (microtus arvalis orcadensis)","volume":"68","page start":"2804","authors with affiliations":"Cucchi, T., CNRS-Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, UMR 7209, Archéoozoologie, histoire des sociétés humaines et de peuplements animaux, 55 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France, Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, St. Mary\u0027s, Elphinstone Road, Aberdeen, United Kingdom; Barnett, R., Durham Evolution and Ancient DNA, Department of Archaeology, Durham University, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom; Martínková, N., Institute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, V.v.i., Květná 8, Brno, 60365, Czech Republic, Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Masaryk University, Kamenice 3, Brno, 62500, Czech Republic; Renaud, S., Laboratoire de Biométrie et Biologie Evolutive, UMR 5558, CNRS, UniversitéLyon 1, Villeurbanne, 69622, France; Renvoisé, E., Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, P.O.

We used a large sample of sex-known human 3D skulls to analyse the rate of sexual dimorphism found in the human neurocranium. We applied the Procrustes ANOVA on the best dimorphic patch found using the proposed workflow. We calculated the accuracy in discriminating sex in a sex-known sample by using our proposed model and the traditional approach. © 2019 International Conference on Metrology for Archaeology and Cultural Heritage.","source":"Scopus","title":"Detection of sexual dimorphism in the human neurocranium at local scale","page start":"571","authors with affiliations":"Bove, A.D., Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution (IPHES), Tarragona, Spain, Area de Prehistòria, Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV), Tarragona, Spain; Profico, A., PalaeoHub, Department of Archaeology, University of York, York, United Kingdom; Lorenzo, C., Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution (IPHES), Tarragona, Spain, Area de Prehistòria, Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV), Tarragona, Spain","author(s) id":"57215200711;56565641200;57214994617;","index keywords":"Geometric morphometric; Local scale; Procrustes; Sexual dimorphism; Traditional approaches; History","document type":"Conference Paper","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Bove A.D., Profico A., Lorenzo C."},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Davis L.G., Bean D.W., Nyers A.J., Brauner D.R.","x":1446.861572265625,"y":554.4832153320312,"id":"8591","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84937030926","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.004123711340206186","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"3","year":"2015","page end":"217","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84937030926\u0026doi\u003d10.1179%2f2051618515Y.0000000007\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d663e3778c5d55c3d061374913ba45320","affiliations":"Pacific Slope Archaeological Laboratory, Oregon State University, Department of Anthropology, 238 Waldo Hall, Corvallis, 97331, United States","source title":"Lithic Technology","abstract":"Archaeology’s participation in the digital renaissance of the twenty-first century requires adequate operationalization of technological methods, such as three-dimensional scanning. Here, we describe and demonstrate a geographic information systems-based lithic morphometric research (GLiMR) software approach. GLiMR accurately and rapidly handles a sequence of ArcGIS procedures to extract geometric morphometric data from 2D and 3D scan files that are impractical to record by hand, opening new doors to the analysis of lithic artifacts. GLiMR generates three main types of geometric properties: shape data, topographic data, and domain aggregate data. These data can be extracted in ways that support other analyses of artifact form, including generalized Procrustes analysis, principal components analysis, and cluster analyses. We illustrate the use of GLiMR by presenting a basic case study that compares the geometric morphometry ofWestern Stemmed Tradition projectile points found in two cache features at Idaho’s Cooper’s Ferry site and from other sites in the Columbia River Plateau region of the Pacific Northwest. Cluster analyses of the generalized Procrustes analysis of 3D landmarks from Cooper’s Ferry cache points fail to separate the two caches from one another on the basis of their geometric morphometric attributes. We interpret these results to suggest that these stemmed projectile points were probably created by persons who shared a specific set of technological production guidelines for the manufacture of Western Stemmed Tradition projectile points. Cluster analyses indicate that Cooper’s Ferry Western Stemmed Tradition projectile points can be morpho-metrically separated from stemmed points found at other regional sites; however, significant overlaps were seen among stemmed projectile points from the Pilcher Creek site, which may suggest the existence of contemporaneous information sharing networks or macroband territorial movements. © W.

A 12-landmark configuration, including cusp tips and 8 points of the molar crown contour, were used to evaluate patterns of variation in lower molar shape among cercopithecoid primates and to predict the taxonomic attribution of 2 archaeological macaques from Roman time periods. The results showed that the lower molar shape of cercopithecoid primates reflects taxonomic affinities, mostly at a subfamily level and close to a tribe level. Thus, the cusp positions and crown contour were important elements of the pattern related to interspecific variation. Additionally, the archaeological specimens, attributed to Macaca sylvanus based on osteological information, were classified using the GM molar shape variability of the cercopithecoid primates studied. The results suggest that their molar shape resembled both M. sylvanus and M. nemestrina, and species attribution varied depending on the comparative sample used. © 2015 S.

Even if several studies have been carried out on this topic in the last decades, there are still some phenomena which need to be thoroughly understood. Here we try to quantify how can the depth of cut marks influence the shape of their cross-sections. This is of crucial important for a valid interpretation of shape data collected on archaeological BSMs. In particular, two groups of cut marks’ cross-sections experimentally produced with two flint burins on a cattle innominate are analysed in this paper by means of 3D microscopy and geometric morphometrics. The two sets of striae show a different depth and a different cross-sectional shape. In particular, shallower cross sections are characterized by less steep walls and consequently by a wider opening angle. If analysis moves to the characteristics of the cutting edge of the burins, it comes out that the different shape between the two groups of striations is probably a function of the way in which the tool penetrates into the bone. These results are relevant for taphonomy, since similar difference in cross-sectional shape were found between marks produced with different raw materials. This contribution highlights the importance of considering the characteristics of tool’s cutting edges in evaluating the meaning of shape variability of cut marks cross-sections. © 2019 International Conference on Metrology for Archaeology and Cultural Heritage.","source":"Scopus","title":"The cut runs deep: Linking the cut marks to the cutting tools","page start":"566","authors with affiliations":"Francesco, B., Università degli Studi di Siena, DSFTA, UR Ecologia Preistorica, Italy; Moretti, E., Università degli Studi di Siena, DSFTA, UR Ecologia Preistorica, Italy; Aureli, D., UMR 7041 ArScAn Equipe An-TET, Université Parigi Ouest Nanterre La Défense, France; Crezzini, J., Università degli Studi di Siena, DSFTA, UR Ecologia Preistorica, Italy; Arrighi, S., Dipartimento di Beni Culturali, Università di Bologna, Italy","author(s) id":"52263086000;57062036800;47061191200;20435708700;14068468600;","index keywords":"Biology; History; 3-D microscopy; Animal resource; Cross-sectional shape; Cultural evolution; Cutting edges; Different shapes; Geometric morphometrics; Shape variabilities; Cutting tools","document type":"Conference Paper","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Francesco B., Moretti E., Aureli D., Crezzini J., Arrighi S."},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Rhode M.P., Arriaza B.T.","x":1366.4410400390625,"y":-2740.771484375,"id":"8464","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33746217091","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"4","year":"2006","page end":"470","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-33746217091\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2fajpa.20333\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003da07ad958ec0daf4a0d8b0ee0a52249fd","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO 65201, United States; Centro de Investigaciones del Hombre en el Desierto, Departamento de Arqueología y Museología, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile; Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri-Columbia, 107 Swallow Hall, Columbia, MO 65201, United States","source title":"American Journal of Physical Anthropology","abstract":"Calculating biodistances among South American populations using cranial measurements is often hindered, as many available skeletal collections exhibit deformation. Acknowledging vault modifications, researchers have sought measurements in other regions which are unaffected by deformation. In the 1970s, a set of 10 \"relatively\" unaffected facial measurements was identified in Argentinean crania that later became the basis of numerous South American biodistance studies. These measurements include: minimum frontal breadth, bizygomatic breadth, orbit height, orbit breadth, palate breath, palate length, upper facial height, basion-prosthion length, nasal height, and nasal breadth. Palate length was excluded from the present analysis due to considerable measurement error. The suitability of these measurements in populations other than Argentineans has not been rigorously tested. Using a sample of 350 prehistoric crania from the Museo Arqueológico San Miguel de Azapa (MASMA, Arica, Chile), this project tested the hypothesis that these measurements are unaffected by either annular or tabular deformation. Results obtained from MANOVA analysis indicate this hypothesis cannot be fully supported. Among males, only 3 of the 9 measurements are unaffected by either form of deformation (palate breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth), while analysis of females indicates that 4 of the 9 measurements remain unaltered (minimum frontal breadth, orbit breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth). Additionally, analogous to the vault, facial measurements display patterns consistent with the deformation applied. Two implications can be drawn from this research: 1) previous studies using these measurements must be interpreted cautiously, and 2) researchers using these measurements must explicitly test their suitability in each population. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Influence of cranial deformation on facial morphology among prehistoric south central andean populations","volume":"130","page start":"462","authors with affiliations":"Rhode, M.P., Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO 65201, United States, Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri-Columbia, 107 Swallow Hall, Columbia, MO 65201, United States; Arriaza, B.T., Centro de Investigaciones del Hombre en el Desierto, Departamento de Arqueología y Museología, Universidad de Tarapacá, Arica, Chile","author(s) id":"15136680600;6602846124;","index keywords":"Argentina; article; calculation; Chile; craniofacial morphology; face malformation; geological time; measurement; multivariate analysis of variance; palate; population distribution; skull malformation; Cephalometry; Craniofacial Abnormalities; Facial Bones; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Skull; South America","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Artificial; Biodistance; Craniofacial; Face; Intentional; South America","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Rhode M.P., Arriaza B.T.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.20333"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"MatÉ-GonzÁlez M.Á., Aramendi J., Yravedra J., Blasco R., Rosell J., GonzÁlez-Aguilera D., DomÍnguez-Rodrigo M.","x":-4889.3876953125,"y":-680.2482299804688,"id":"8592","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85018756590","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.018556701030927835","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"3","year":"2017","page end":"370","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85018756590\u0026doi\u003d10.1111%2fjmi.12575\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d5409d08b4fd034aeaea114dd2b32a53d","affiliations":"Department of Cartography and Terrain Engineering, Polytechnic School of Avila, University of Salamanca, Avila, Spain; C.A.I.

Due to the difficulties in the correct identification of cut marks, many criteria for their description and classification have been suggested. Different techniques, such as three-dimensional digital microscope (3D DM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and micro-photogrammetry (M-PG) have been recently applied to the study of cut marks. Although the 3D DM and LSCM microscopic techniques are the most commonly used for the 3D identification of cut marks, M-PG has also proved to be very efficient and a low-cost method. M-PG is a noninvasive technique that allows the study of the cortical surface without any previous preparation of the samples, and that generates high-resolution models. Despite the current application of microscopic and micro-photogrammetric techniques to taphonomy, their reliability has never been tested. In this paper, we compare 3D DM, LSCM and M-PG in order to assess their resolution and results. In this study, we analyse 26 experimental cut marks generated with a metal knife.

Experiments with hafting, impact, and rejuvenation demonstrate that a single point-type may manifest more than one \"time-sensitive\" shape within its normal uselife. © Copyright Society for American Archaeology 1986.","source":"Scopus","title":"Morphological Projectile Point Typology: Replication Experimentation and Technological Analysis","volume":"51","page start":"603","authors with affiliations":"Flenniken, J.J., Laboratory of Lithic Technology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA  99164-4910, United States; Raymond, A.W., Laboratory of Lithic Technology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA  99164-4910, United States","author(s) id":"7801474689;7102813728;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Flenniken J.J., Raymond A.W.","doi":"10.2307/281755"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Guillaud E., Cornette R., Béarez P.","x":-386.324951171875,"y":-161.2987060546875,"id":"8634","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84949036039","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.004123711340206186","Modularity Class":"1","year":"2016","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84949036039\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2015.11.010\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dfade51ae7c89a1b701dfae13668f2be8","affiliations":"UMR 7209, CNRS/MNHN Archeozoologie, archéobotanique: societes, pratiques et environnement, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Département Écologie et Gestion de la Biodiversité (EGB), 55 rue Buffon, CP 56, Paris, 75005, France; UMR 7208, CNRS/MNHN/IRD/UPMC, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Département Milieux et Peuplements Aquatiques (DMPA), 7 rue Cuvier, Paris Cedex 05, 75231, France; UMR 7205, CNRS/MNHN/UPMC/EPHE, Institut de Systématique, Évolution et Biodiversité (ISYEB), Museum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Département Systématique et Évolution, 45 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France; UMS 2700, Outils et méthodes de la systématique intégrative, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Département Systématique et Evolution, 57 rue Cuvier, Paris Cedex 05, 75231, France","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Salmonids, especially Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and trout (Salmo trutta sspp.), are ubiquitous throughout the European Upper Paleolithic archaeological context; however, as these species are morphologically similar, species identification can be difficult. Here we present (I) a species classification rate for the two species using modern reference specimens, and (II) an application on archaeological vertebrae of Salmo sp. recovered from the cave of Le Taillis des Coteaux (Vienne, France). This cave contains a rich archaeological sequence with an exceptionally well preserved stratigraphy, encompassing the Upper Paleolithic from the Aurignacian to the Middle Magdalenian. To discriminate both species, we used a geometric morphometric approach to analyse vertebral form using landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks, coupled with k-Nearest Neighbour classification method. Other quantitative approaches like Principal Component Analyses exist, but the k-NN method increases the power of these analyses. Linear Discriminant Analysis was also used; however, the k-NN method provided better results. This study presents the initial results of geometric morphometric discrimination of European salmonid bones. The success rate of reassigning these to the modern reference specimens ranged from 84 to 100%, depending on the vertebrae studied, with the data indicating that S. trutta sspp. were the dominant taxon on site.

Location: Investigations were performed simultaneously on olive stones from extant wild populations, extant cultivated varieties from various Mediterranean countries, and archaeological assemblages of Spanish, French and Italian settlements. Methods: A combination of morphometrics (traditional and geometrical) allowed us to study both the size and shape of endocarp structure. Concerning shape, a size-standardized method coupled with fitted polynomial regression analysis was performed. Results: We found morphological criteria for discriminating between wild and cultivated olive cultivars, and established patterns of morphological variation of olive material according to the geographical origin (for extant material) and to the age of the olive forms (for archaeological material). Levels of morphological convergences and divergences between wild olive populations and cultivated varieties are presented as evidence. Main conclusions: Morphological changes of endocarps of olive under domestication at both geographical and chronological scales provide new criteria for the identification of olive cultivars. They allow to determine the origins of cultivated forms created and/or introduced in the north-western Mediterranean regions and to understand how human migrations affected the rest of the Western Mediterranean regions. A model of diffusion of olive cultivation is proposed. It shows evidence of an indigenous origin of the domestication process, which is currently recognized in the north-western area since the Bronze Age.","source":"Scopus","title":"Historical biogeography of olive domestication (Olea europaea L.) as revealed by geometrical morphometry applied to biological and archaeological material","volume":"31","authors with affiliations":"Terral, J.-F., Ctr.

Clovis may be the best documented Paleoamerican culture in North America, but much remains to be learned about the movement and interactions of Clovis peoples. Similarities among Clovis points from geographically diverse locations have led some researchers to suggest that a uniform projectile point technology existed across North America during Clovis times. Others have rejected this idea, proposing local and independent technological adaptations to different regional environments. To investigate these ideas, we used digital morphometrics to analyze 50 Clovis points from nine different contexts. First, 3D surface models of the points were created with a portable laser scanner. Next, these models were digitally cross-sectioned through both faces, yielding two-dimensional isoheight contours of flake scar patterns that reflect the original reduction techniques used to shape the projectile points. In the final step, the contours were transformed with elliptic Fourier analysis into Fourier coefficient series, and patterns of variation and symmetry were explored with principal components analysis. When compared to modern Clovis point replicas made by an expert knapper, the flake scar contours of the ancient Clovis points showed little morphological variation and a large degree of bifacial symmetry.

Here, trampling experiments were conducted to investigate these effects and to describe the types of surface modification that could occur on bone in coastal sediment. The results suggest that bone is significantly more likely to exhibit surface modification if trampled in shelly rather than sandy sediment. Burnt bone is less likely to display trampling modification. This is probably because, prior to trampling, burning exfoliates the cortex making the observation of markings on bone problematic. Pitting, trampling lines and sheen were found to be the most prevalent form of surface modification. Pitting is a particularly over-looked criterion and its presence on archaeological bone suggests that the effects of trampling should be considered in zooarchaeological analyses. The pervasiveness of sheen and trampling lines on the experimental bone makes it possible that some incidence of trampling could be mistaken for use-wear or intentional polish. However, the vast majority of trampled bone exhibits sheen which does not resemble anthropogenic specimens and trampling is unlikely to smooth bone fragment edges. This experiment demonstrates that modification caused by trampling can generally be differentiated from butchery markings. The high percentage of modified trampled bone in the shelly deposits suggests that some shell-marks may be mistaken for cut marks, if recovered in an archaeological context. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","source":"Scopus","title":"Trampling in coastal sites: An experimental study on the effects of shell on bone in coastal sediment","volume":"330","page start":"156","authors with affiliations":"Reynard, J.P., Evolutionary Studies Institute, University of the Witwatersrand, Private Bag 3, Wits 2050, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa","author(s) id":"55932321800;","index keywords":"archaeology; bone; coastal sediment; experimental study; shell; trampling","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Reynard J.P.","doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2013.11.007"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Cornette R., Herrel A., Stoetzel E., Moulin S., Hutterer R., Denys C., Baylac M.","x":-593.6965942382812,"y":-323.79437255859375,"id":"9186","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84911059124","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"1","year":"2015","page end":"330","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84911059124\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2014.10.020\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dcc0a3d4704c96f5d3c9bf123c9ffdc46","affiliations":"UMR CNRS/MNHN/UPMC/EPHE 7205, Institut de Systématique, Evolution, Biodiversité (ISYEB), Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, 45 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France; UMS CNRS/MNHN 2700, Outils et Méthodes de la Systématique Intégrative, Plate-forme de morphométrie, 45 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France; UMR CNRS/MNHN 7179, Mécanismes adaptatifs: des organismes aux communautés, 57 rue Cuvier, Paris cedex 05, 75231, France; Ghent University, Evolutionary Morphology of Vertebrates, K.L.

Consequently, they are poorly studied, even if they could possess species-specific information. Here, we use mandibles of white-toothed shrews and a taphonomic pattern of fragmentation composed of seven pieces to test their validity in species assignment. Using an extant non-ambiguous reference sample of five species, we explore the specific assignments of fragments obtained by a k-NN method of classification, artificially derived from the complete mandible.

We propose an approach to investigate the role of development for morphological asymmetry by means of morphometric methods. Our approach combines geometric morphometrics with the two-way ANOVA customary for conventional analyses of fluctuating asymmetry and can discover localized features of shape variation by examining the patterns of covariance among landmarks This approach extends the notion of form used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry from collections of distances between morphological landmarks to an explicitly geometric concept of shape characterized by the configuration of landmarks. We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings of tsetse files (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring of young and old females. The morphological landmarks differed markedly in their degree of variability, but multivariate patterns of landmark covariation identified by principal component analysis were generally similar between fluctuating asymmetry (within-individual variability) and variation among individuals. Therefore, there is no evidence that special developmental processes control fluctuating asymmetry. We relate some of the morphometric patterns to processes known to be involved in the development of fly wings.","source":"Scopus","title":"Geometric morphometrics of developmental instability: Analyzing patterns of fluctuating asymmetry with procrustes methods","volume":"52","page start":"1363","authors with affiliations":"Klingenberg, C.P., Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alta.

Recent consensus views cranial morphology as largely indicative of population history in humans, with some anatomical cranial regions/measurements being more informative on population history, while others being under selection pressure. We test earlier findings using the largest and most diverse cranial dataset available as yet: 7,423 male specimens from 135 geographic human population samples represented by 33 standard craniometric linear measurements. We calculated Mahalanobis D 2 for three datasets: complete cranial dataset; facial measurement dataset; and neurocranial measurement dataset; these morphological distance matrices were then compared to matrices of geographic distances as well as of several climatic variables. Additionally, we calculated Fst values for our cranial measurements and compared the results to the expected Fst values for neutral genetic loci. Our findings support the hypothesis that cranial, and especially neurocranial morphology, is phylogenetically informative, and that aspects of the face and cranium are subject to selection related to climatic factors. The Fst analysis suggest that selection to climate is largely restricted to groups living in extremely cold environments, including Northeast Asia, North America, and Northern Europe, though each of these regions appears to have arrived at their morphology through distinct adaptive pathways. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Climate signatures in the morphological differentiation of worldwide modern human populations","volume":"292","page start":"1720","authors with affiliations":"Hubbe, M., Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueológicas Y Museo, Universidad Católica del Norte, San Pedro de Atacama, Chile; Hanihara, T., Department of Anatomy, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Japan; Harvati, K., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany, Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology, University of Tübingen, Rümelinstrasse 19-23, 72070 Tübingen, Germany","author(s) id":"10338946900;7003959650;57203032637;","index keywords":"anatomical variation; article; climate; controlled study; data base; geography; human; human tissue; male; morphology; phylogeny; population; population differentiation; priority journal; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Anthropometry; Asia; Cephalometry; Climate; Cold Climate; Europe; Evolution; Facial Bones; Fossils; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Humans; Male; North America; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Population; Population Dynamics; Selection, Genetic; Skull","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Adaptation; Craniometrics; Fst; Human variation; Neanderthals; Population history","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Hubbe M., Hanihara T., Harvati K.","doi":"10.1002/ar.20976"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Rohlf F.J.","x":550.518798828125,"y":-1468.7774658203125,"id":"8879","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0002416668","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","Modularity Class":"4","year":"1996","page end":"129","source title":"Advances in Morphometrics","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Morphometric spaces, shape components and the effects of linear transformations","page start":"117","authors with affiliations":"Rohlf, F.J.","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Rohlf F.J."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Courtenay L.A., Maté-González M.A., Aramendi J., Yravedra J., González-Aguilera D., Domínguez-Rodrigo M.","x":-6070.14453125,"y":-421.16552734375,"id":"9062","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85049469892","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"7","year":"2018","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85049469892\u0026doi\u003d10.7717%2fpeerj.5133\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d5decd3305bf41a1b3566a9633d86faff","affiliations":"Área de Prehistoria, Universitat Rovira I Virgili Tarragona, Tarragona, Spain; Institut de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social (IPHES), Tarragona, Spain; Department of Prehistory, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; Department of Cartography and Terrain Engineering, Polytechnic School of Avila, University of Salamanca, Avila, Spain; IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Madrid, Spain","access type":"Open Access","source title":"PeerJ","abstract":"The analysis of bone surface modifications (BSMs) is a prominent part of paleoanthropological studies, namely taphonomic research.

It is intended to provide archaeologists with a simple and easy-to-use tool for performing 3-D landmarks-based geometric morphometric shape analysis on 3-D digital models of archaeological artifacts. It requires no prior knowledge of programming or proficiency in statistics. AGMT3-D consists of a data-acquisition procedure for automatically positioning 3-D models in space and fitting them with grids of 3-D semi-landmarks. It also provides a number of analytical tools and procedures that allow the processing and statistical analysis of the data, including generalized Procrustes analysis, principal component analysis, a warp tool, automatic calculation of shape variabilities and statistical tests. It provides an output of quantitative, objective and reproducible results in numerical, textual and graphic formats. These can be used to answer archaeologically significant questions relating to morphologies and morphological variabilities in artifact assemblages. Following the presentation of the software and its functions, we apply it to a case study addressing the effects of different types of raw material on the morphologies and morphological variabilities present in an experimentally produced Acheulian handaxe assemblage. The results show that there are statistically significant differences between the mean shapes and shape variabilities of handaxes produced on flint and those produced on basalt. With AGMT3-D, users can analyze artifact assemblages and address questions that are deducible from the morphologies and morphological variabilities of material culture assemblages. These questions can relate to issues of, among others, relative chronology, cultural affinities, tool function and production technology. AGMT3-D is aimed at making 3-D landmarks-based geometric morphometric shape analysis more accessible to archaeologists, in the hope that this method will become a tool commonly used by archaeologists. © 2018 Herzlinger, Grosman.

The Aterian is defined by the presence of \u0027tanged\u0027 or \u0027stemmed\u0027 tools, which have been widely assumed to be among the earliest projectile weapon tips. The present study systematically investigates morphological variation in a large sample of Aterian tools to test the hypothesis that these tools were hafted and/or used as projectile weapons. Methodology/Principal Findings: Both classical morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis of tool outlines are used to show that the shape variation in the sample exhibits size-dependent patterns consistent with a reduction of the tools from the tip down, with the tang remaining intact. Additionally, the process of reduction led to increasing side-to-side asymmetries as the tools got smaller. Finally, a comparison of shape-change trajectories between Aterian tools and Late Paleolithic arrowheads from the North German site of Stellmoor reveal significant differences in terms of the amount and location of the variation. Conclusions/Significance: The patterns of size-dependent shape variation strongly support the functional hypothesis of Aterian tools as hafted knives or scrapers with alternating active edges, rather than as weapon tips. Nevertheless, the same morphological patterns are interpreted as one of the earliest evidences for a hafting modification, and for the successful combination of different raw materials (haft and stone tip) into one implement, in itself an important achievement in the evolution of hominin technologies. © 2011 Radu Iovita.","source":"Scopus","title":"Shape variation in aterian tanged tools and the origins of projectile technology: A morphometric perspective on stone tool function","volume":"6","authors with affiliations":"Iovita, R., Department of Palaeolithic Studies, Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz, Schloss Monrepos, Neuwied, Germany","author(s) id":"6506567945;","index keywords":"article; elliptical Fourier analysis; fossil hominin; Fourier analysis; materials; morphometrics; Paleolithic; projectile weapon; Stone Age; tool use; weapon; weight, mass and size; archeology; devices; human; Archaeology; Equipment and Supplies; Fourier Analysis; Humans","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"e29029","pr_indegree":"9.0","authors":"Iovita R.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0029029"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":40.92000198364258},{"label":"Klingenberg C.P.","x":-196.86685180664062,"y":-406.53704833984375,"id":"9033","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-78650839801","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.05360824742268041","Modularity Class":"1","issue":"2","year":"2011","page end":"357","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-78650839801\u0026doi\u003d10.1111%2fj.1755-0998.2010.02924.x\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dd30b5ebcfc053aa3854553146529e97f","affiliations":"Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Michael Smith Building, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom","source title":"Molecular Ecology Resources","abstract":"Increasingly, data on shape are analysed in combination with molecular genetic or ecological information, so that tools for geometric morphometric analysis are required.

The plasticity of grapevine anatomical characters was quantified in relation to maturity or age of wood and environmental conditions. For the first time, quantitative eco-anatomical features of charcoal from archaeological sites (South of France, Bronze Age - Modern Period) were compared to the reference models established beforehand. This procedure allowed us to identify the status (wild or cultivated-domesticated) of certain sub-fossil samples. Our results complement data from archaeobotany and from traditional and geometric morphometric analyses of Vitis pips. They confirm the collection/use of the wild grapevine during the Bronze Age and the exploitation of cultivated forms on coastal or near coastal sites (Mediterranean), from the Iron Age up to the Modern Period.

So far, however, the impact of resharpening on the distinctiveness of the blades of Paleoindian projectile points has not been investigated quantitatively. With this in mind, we used geometric morphometric techniques to compare the blades of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points from the Southern Plains of North America. We evaluated two hypotheses. The first was that blade shape distinguishes the three types. We found that blade shape distinguished Clovis points from both Folsom and Plainview points, but did not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The second hypothesis we tested was that resharpening eliminates blade shape differences among the types. To test this hypothesis, we used size as a proxy for -resharpening. The results of this analysis were similar to those obtained in the first analysis.

The shoulder joint facilitates a wide range of combined motions due to the simultaneous motion of all three bones: clavicle, scapula, and humerus. Accordingly, we used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyze shape differences in the glenoid cavity and linear morphometrics to obtain the degree of directional asymmetry in a medieval population. Methods: To calculate directional asymmetry, clavicles, humeri, and scapulae from 100 individuals (50 females, 50 males) were measured. Landmarks and semilandmarks were placed within a three-dimensional reconstruction of the glenoid cavity for analysis of shape differences between sides of the body within sexes. Results: Linear morphometrics showed significant directional asymmetry in both sexes in all bones. Geometric morphometrics revealed significant shape differences of the glenoid cavity between sides of the body in females but not in males. Both indicators of directional asymmetry (%DA and %AA) did not show significant differences between sexes. PLS analysis revealed a significant correlation between glenoid shape and two humeral head diameters only in females on the left side of the body. Conclusions: The studied population, perhaps due to a high level of activity, exhibited slightly greater upper-limb bone bilateral asymmetry than other agricultural populations. Results suggest that the upper limbs were involved in similar activity patterns in both sexes but were characterized by different habitual behaviors. To obtain comprehensive results, studies should be based on sophisticated methods such as geometric morphometrics as well as standard measurements. Am. J. Hum.

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis.

The traditional model argues for an early use of the throwing spear followed by the spearthrower and bow and arrow. A major difficulty in testing this model is identifying the functional variables that characterize different weaponry. The evolution of prehistoric weaponry is reexamined here from an evolutionary perspective where projectile points are considered part of the complete weapon system and variation within that system is identified. The engineering of four weapon systems, the thrusting spear, throwing spear, spearthrower, and bow, are examined to identify those point variables that enhance the success of the system. These variables are then measured on a 9000-year sequence of projectile points from northwestern Wyoming to examine time/space patterns. The patterns reveal that the spearthrower was in use prior to 7500 years ago.","source":"Scopus","title":"Getting to the point: Evolutionary change in prehistoric weaponry","volume":"5","page start":"345","authors with affiliations":"Hughes, S.S., Department of Anthropology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, United States","author(s) id":"57199311700;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Engineering of primitive weaponry; Mummy Cave © 1998 plenum publishing corporation; Prehistoric weaponry; Projectile point; Weapon evolution","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Hughes S.S.","doi":"10.1007/BF02428421"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Buchanan B., Collard M.","x":2906.6640625,"y":2312.95947265625,"id":"9061","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-34548042992","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.016494845360824743","Modularity Class":"5","issue":"3","year":"2007","page end":"393","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-34548042992\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jaa.2007.02.005\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dd8922fad2821139f00357c8580f5d35f","affiliations":"Laboratory of Biological Anthropology, Department of Anthropology, University of British Columbia, 6303 NW Marine Drive, Vancouver, V6T 1Z1, Canada; AHRC Centre for the Evolution of Cultural Diversity, University College London, United Kingdom","source title":"Journal of Anthropological Archaeology","abstract":"The initial colonization of North America remains a controversial topic. There is widespread agreement that Clovis and related cultures of the Early Paleoindian period (∼11,500-10,500 BP) represent the first well-documented indications of human occupation, but considerable differences of opinion exist regarding the origins of these cultures. Here, we report the results of a study in which data from a continent-wide sample of Early Paleoindian projectile points were analyzed with cladistic methods in order to assess competing models of colonization as well as several alternative explanations for the variation among the points, including adaptation to local environmental circumstances, cultural diffusion, and site type effects. The analyses suggest that a rapidly migrating population produced the Early Paleoindian projectile point assemblages. They also suggest that the population in question is unlikely to have entered North America from either the Isthmus of Panama or the Midatlantic region. According to the analyses, the Early Paleoindians are more likely to have entered North America via either the ice-free corridor between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that is hypothesized to have opened around 12,000 BP, or the Northwest Coast. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Taphonomic and experimental approaches have been systematically applied in an effort to understand the technical and artistic procedures followed. In this study, we applied a new combination of 3-dimensional microscopy (focus variation optical microscope) and micro-CT scanning to the analysis of two Magdalenian engraved specimens: a reindeer antler from the site of Neschers (France), engraved with the partial image of a horse in left profile, and a horse metatarsal from Courbet Cave, Penne (France), engraved with a horse head also in left profile. Results of the analysis suggest that both the Neschers and Courbet Cave engravings had been prepared before being carved. The overall contours of the horse body/head were incised first, while anatomical features were added afterwards. In the Neschers case, the incision resulted from the repeated scratching of a previously made incision in order to enlarge the engraving, possibly reflecting the engraver\u0027s aesthetic sense. The combination of the techniques used in this study is applicable to fragile or unique archaeological specimens. Micro-CT scanning, in particular, provides non-invasive means for identifying engravings that are obscured by encrusted sediment. The application of these techniques can potentially open new avenues for the authentication, technical and gestural recognition and interpretation of incised forms and artistic creativity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Application of 3-dimensional microscopy and micro-CT scanning to the analysis of Magdalenian portable art on bone and antler","volume":"40","page start":"2464","authors with affiliations":"Bello, S.M., Department of Earth Sciences, The Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD, United Kingdom; De Groote, I., Department of Earth Sciences, The Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD, United Kingdom, Research Centre in Evolutionary Anthropology and Palaeoecology, School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University, Byrom Street, Liverpool L3 3AF, United Kingdom; Delbarre, G., Department of Earth Sciences, The Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"10139236300;35791611100;55609071600;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; art; bone; Paleolithic; taphonomy; France; Animalia; Equidae; Rangifer tarandus","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Courbet Cave; Engraving; Focus variation microscopy; Magdalenian portable art; Micro-CT; Neschers","pr_indegree":"6.0","authors":"Bello S.M., De Groote I., Delbarre G.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.12.016"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":29.279998779296875},{"label":"Shott M.J., Ballenger J.A.M.","x":2426.237548828125,"y":4834.3623046875,"id":"8936","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33847764928","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"1","year":"2007","page end":"175","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-33847764928\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f40035302\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d094b33e9c46ae0b16869fe2961f2da91","affiliations":"Department of Classical Studies, Anthropology, and Archaeology, University of Akron, Akron, OH 44325-1910, United States; Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, United States","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"Stone tools were reduced during use, with implications both for classification and curation rates.

The chance of attaining a high level of accuracy regarding sex allocations is related to the skeletal component analyzed and the ability of the techniques employed to describe shape and size differences among the sexes. Current opinion regards the hip bone as the most reliable sex indicator because it is the most dimorphic bone, particularly in adult individuals. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the greater sciatic notch and the ischiopubic complex morphology by employing geometric morphometric techniques, based on semilandmark and multivariate statistical methods, in order to develop a reliable and accurate technique for adult sex estimation. The sample analyzed consisted of 121 adult left hip bones randomly selected from the collection of documented skeletons housed at the Museu Antropologico de Coimbra. Morphometric analysis was based on coordinates of landmarks and semilandmarks of the ilium and ischiopubic regions that were digitized on 2D photographic images. Discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation and k-means clustering of shape and shape-size variables were used in order to classify individuals by sex. For the greater sciatic notch, average accuracy of 90.9% was achieved with both multivariate analyses based on shape variables. For the ischiopubic complex, the values obtained with shape variables were 93.4% and 90.1% for discriminant and k-means, respectively. Females were misclassified more frequently than males, especially for the ischiopubic complex. When multivariate statistical analyses were performed using shape-size variables, the percentages of correct classifications were lower than those obtained with shape variables. We conclude that the use of geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics is a reliable method to quantify pelvic shape differences between the sexes and could be applied to discriminate between females and males. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Radiometric dates and the archaeological context (Acheulo-Yabrudian) bracket the associated cave layers to between 200 and 500ka (thousands of years ago), making it one of the earliest cranial fossils discovered in the Near East thus far. Its geographic position, at the corridor between Africa and Eurasia, in combination with its probable Middle Pleistocene date make it a crucial specimen for interpreting later human evolution. Since its discovery, qualitative descriptive and traditional morphometric methods have variously suggested affinities to Homo erectus (Zhoukoudian), Homo neanderthalensis (Tabun), and early Homo sapiens (Skhul and Qafzeh). To better determine the taxonomic affinities of the Zuttiyeh fossil, this study uses 3D semilandmark geometric morphometric techniques and multivariate statistical analyses to quantify the frontal and zygomatic region and compare it with other Middle to Late Pleistocene African and Eurasian hominins.Our results show that the frontal and zygomatic morphology of Zuttiyeh is most similar to Shanidar 5, a Near East Neanderthal, Arago 21, a European Middle Pleistocene hominin, and Skhul 5, an early H.sapiens.

However, given that it most likely postdates the split between these two lineages, Zuttiyeh might also be an early representative of the Neanderthal lineage.

Virtual reconstruction of the remainder of the cranium was accomplished using mirror-imaging and reference-based methods, employing 3D geometric morphometrics from a sample of recent human crania to compute coordinate-based estimates of the missing parts.

Each part combines a number of techno-functional units, and various processes may be responsible for the shape variability of these units. In order to investigate the relative contribution of each process to the overall variability of a projectile implement, one must identify the point of demarcation between its techno-functional units. In the present paper, the concept of shape modularity is introduced to precisely identify this locus. The application of geometric morphometrics and shape modularity to the study of two Aurignacian osseous projectile point types, i.e., split- and massive-based points, reveals interesting patterns. On both types, the maximum width delimits the distal and proximal techno-functional units of these objects. When focusing on the morphometric variability and the geographic distribution of the implements’ proximal unit, the eight shapes identified for split-based points are found over vast regions of Europe. On the other hand, the two proximal shapes defined for massive-based points show a pattern of local, or regional, aggregation. These proximal shapes were likely considered fit for hafting and hunting by the prehistoric populations who reproduced them, and they are interpreted as a proxy for the socially shared rules of production that guided the manufacture of these tool types. They could therefore be used in future studies that aim to identify group membership amongst the Aurignacian metapopulation and the extent of their interactions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"On the shape of things: A geometric morphometrics approach to investigate Aurignacian group membership","volume":"101","page start":"99","authors with affiliations":"Doyon, L., Institute of Cultural Heritage, Shandong University, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan, 250100, China, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR 5199 – PACEA, Université de Bordeaux, Bât.

Here, we report an attempt to resolve this argument using a large sample of Clovis points from dated assemblages and a suite of shape analysis methods known as geometric morphometrics. The study tested the two main hypotheses that have been put forward in the debate: the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis, which holds that Clovis points do not vary regionally, and the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis, which holds that there is regional variation as a consequence of Clovis groups adjusting their food-getting toolkits to local conditions. We used discriminant function analysis and a multivariate extension of the t test to assess whether differences in shape exist at two scales. The first set of analyses compared points from the most obvious environmental regions in North America, the East and the West. The second set of analyses investigated differences among points from subregions within the East and West. The analyses revealed significant differences between points from the East and the West and among points from some subregions. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these differences are not the result of the most common confounding factors, raw material quality and resharpening.

One prominent example of this debate is Clovis technology (13,350-12,500 calendar years before present), which represents the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America. Clovis projectile points appear to have been made the same way regardless of region, but several studies have documented differences in shape that appear to be regional. Two processes have been proposed for shape variation: (1) stochastic mechanisms such as copy error (drift) and (2) Clovis groups adapting their hunting equipment to the characteristics of prey and local habitat. We used statistical analysis of Clovis-point flake-scar pattern and geometric morphometrics to examine whether drift alone could cause significant differences in the technology of Stone Age colonizing hunter-gatherers. Importantly, our analysis was intraregional to rule out a priori environmental adaptation. Our analysis confirmed that the production technique was the same across the sample, but we found significant shape differences in Clovis point populations made from distinct stone outcrops. Given that current archaeological evidence suggests stone outcrops were \"hubs\" of regional Clovis activity, our dichotomous, intraregional results quantitatively confirm that Clovis foragers engaged in two tiers of social learning. The lower, ancestral tier relates to point production and can be tied to conformist transmission of tool-making processes across the Clovis population. The upper, derived tier relates to point shape, which can be tied to drift that resulted from increased forager interaction at different stone-outcrop hubs and decreased forager interaction among groups using different outcrops. Given that Clovis artifacts represent the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America, our results suggest that we need to alter our theoretical understanding of how quickly drift can occur within a colonizing population and create differences among socially learned technological characters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Social learning and technological evolution during the Clovis colonization of the New World","volume":"80","page start":"159","authors with affiliations":"Eren, M.I., Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO  65211, United States, Department of Archaeology, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Cleveland, OH  44106, United States; Buchanan, B., Department of Anthropology, University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK  74104, United States; O\u0027Brien, M.J., Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO  65211, United States","author(s) id":"23975681200;11241802300;36128081000;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; archaeology; artifact; colonization; dispersal; hunter-gatherer; learning; morphometry; new world order; Pleistocene; Stone Age; North America; archeology; cultural anthropology; human; migration; North America; social learning; weapon; Archaeology; Cultural Evolution; Human Migration; Humans; North America; Social Learning; Weapons","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Cultural transmission; Dispersals; Drift; Geometric morphometrics; Hunter-gatherers; Peopling of the Americas","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Eren M.I., Buchanan B., O\u0027Brien M.J.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.01.002"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Domínguez-Rodrigo M., de Juana S., Galán A.B., Rodríguez M.","x":-5171.77587890625,"y":-1072.391845703125,"id":"8826","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-70349783751","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.016494845360824743","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"12","year":"2009","page end":"2654","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-70349783751\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2009.07.017\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003da373b089296c5023568181278b5f2d5a","affiliations":"Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, c/Prof. Aranguren s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Microscopic signatures have previously been used to emphasize the similarities of butchery and trampling marks. The experimental background applied to differentiate both types of marks has been rather limited and authors have sometimes reached conflicting conclusions. This is partly due to methodological reasons: some authors have used very high magnification to examine microscopic features, whereas others have relied on more reduced magnification. Likewise, some experiments have exposed bones to trampling for reduced periods (minutes) whereas others have used longer time periods (hours). The present study stresses that the use of a scanning electronic microscope is not practical for identifying the impact of butchery and trampling marks in complete bone assemblages. It also emphasizes that previous studies have not addressed all the possible variables that could potentially be used to discriminate these marks, nor have they quantified the morphological patterns of each type of mark. Here we present a multivariate analysis of more than a dozen variables and show that butchery and trampling marks have very distinctive microscopic morphology. We advocate the use of a low magnification approach (≤40×), which can enable the analysis of complete assemblages using either hand lenses or binocular lenses. We also show the morphological criteria that differentiate butchery cut marks made with simple and retouched tools. We show that whereas complete discrimination of marks is impossible due to some degree of overlap, the list of criteria derived through multivariate analyses can be confidently used to correctly differentiate butchery and trampling marks in more than 90% of cases. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, recent experiments on trampling animals and biting crocodiles have shown each to be capable of producing mimics of such marks.

Bone modifications among Ethiopian Plio–Pleistocene hominid and faunal remains at Asa Issie, Maka, Hadar, and Bouri were reassessed in light of these findings. The results show that crocodiles were important modifiers of these bone assemblages. The relative roles of hominids, mammalian carnivores, and crocodiles in the formation of Oldowan zooarchaeological assemblages will only be accurately revealed by better bounding equifinality.

The origins and production patterns of large bifacial cutting tools (‘LCTs’) – the marker of the Acheulean techno-complex – and the systematic changes in this behaviour through time are gaining increasing interest in paleoanthropology. Here we provide a synthesis of early Acheulean LCT variation in a landscape context by analysing assemblages from four different quasi-contemporaneous (∼1.4 Ma) sites from the Koobi Fora Formation. We characterize this variation using both 3D geometric morphometric and descriptive approaches. The expansive lateral exposures of fluvial and lacustrine sediments, as well as the associated tephrostratigraphy of the Koobi Fora Formation provide the landscape context that enables these comparative analyses. Our study demonstrates that when multiple contemporaneous early Acheulean localities are analysed together, a broader picture of LCT variability is elucidated. Four sites at Koobi Fora appear to represent a single system of lithic economy, characterized by a discrete trajectory of changes in LCT size and shape. These sites have ranges of LCT forms which appear to represent different but overlapping stages on a single reduction trajectory. Certain sites exhibit the full reduction trajectory while others exhibit only fragments of this trajectory. Other inter-site lithic proxies further complement these patterns in LCT variability. We explore patterns of site function, mobility and hominin landscape use, all of which may be suggestive of a depth of planning in early Acheulean hominins wherein technological activities were undertaken in substantial anticipation of future needs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"Site fragmentation, hominin mobility and LCT variability reflected in the early Acheulean record of the Okote Member, at Koobi Fora, Kenya","volume":"125","page start":"159","authors with affiliations":"Presnyakova, D., Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology, University of Tübingen, Schloss Hohentübingen, Tübingen, 72070, Germany; Braun, D.R., Center for the Advanced Study of Hominid Paleobiology, George Washington UniversityWashington, DC  20052, United States; Conard, N.J., Department of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology, University of Tübingen, Schloss Hohentübingen, Tübingen, 72070, Germany; Feibel, C., Department of Anthropology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ  08901-1414, United States; Harris, J.W.K., Department of Anthropology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ  08901-1414, United States; Pop, C.M., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, 04103, Germany; Schlager, S., Biological Anthropology, Faculty of Medicine, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, 79098, Germany; Archer, W., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, 04103, Germany, Department of Archaeology, University of Cape Town7700, South Africa","author(s) id":"56429690500;23972180300;6603626316;6603873935;55740177800;55860417700;48662907600;35085743300;","index keywords":"Acheulean; anthropology; chronology; hominid; landscape; mobility; morphometry; tool use; animal; archeology; hominid; Kenya; technology; Animals; Archaeology; Hominidae; Kenya; Technology","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Early Acheulean; Geometric morphometrics; Hominin behaviour; Landscape scale variation; Large cutting tools; Lithic analysis","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Presnyakova D., Braun D.R., Conard N.J., Feibel C., Harris J.W.K., Pop C.M., Schlager S., Archer W.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhevol.2018.07.008"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"O\u0027Higgins P.","x":593.8407592773438,"y":3971.8974609375,"id":"9220","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0001065047","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","authors with affiliations":"O\u0027Higgins, P.","Modularity Class":"6","year":"2000","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Vertebrate Ontogeny and Phylogeny: Implications for the Study of Hominid Skeletal Evolution","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"3.0","title":"Quantitative approaches to the study of craniofacial growth and evolution: Advances in morphometric techniques","authors":"O\u0027Higgins P."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Bonney H.","x":-6290.63623046875,"y":-1852.9705810546875,"id":"9305","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84904042270","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"4","year":"2014","page end":"584","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84904042270\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2fajpa.22558\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003db73fd110bfd32a88a01871fa98bbed44","affiliations":"Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 5BD, United Kingdom","source title":"American Journal of Physical Anthropology","abstract":"Analysis of cut marks in bone is largely limited to two dimensional qualitative description.

These pieces are non-standardized knapping products produced by discoidal and orthogonal core technologies. Moreover, macro-wear studies attest to various activities on diverse materials with no evidence of hafting or projectile use. The aim of this paper is to test the geometric morphometric approach on non-standardized artefacts applying the Elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA) to 3D contours and to assess the potential relationship between size and shape, technology and function. This study is innovative in that it is the first time that this method, considered to be a valuable complement for describing technological and functional attributes, is applied to 3D contours of lithic products. Our results show that this methodology ensures a very good degree of accuracy in describing shape variations of the sharp edges of technologically non-standardized convergent tools. EFA on 3D contours indicates variations in deviations of the outline along the third dimension (i.e., dorso-ventrally) and yields quantitative and insightful information on the actual shape variations of tools. Several statistically significant relationships are found between shape variation and use-wear attributes, though the results emphasize the large variability of the shape of the convergent tools, which, in general, does not show a strong direct association with technological features and function. This is in good agreement with the technological context of this chronological period, characterized by a wide diversity of non-standardized tools adapted to multipurpose functions for varied subsistence activities. © 2016 Chacón et al.

The correct identification of bone modifications, including percussion, cut and tooth marks, is a key issue within this debate. While many authors have shown that carnivore and human modifications can be easily distinguished, it is true that sometimes percussion marks without associated microstriations and tooth pits overlap morphologically, causing confusion, especially when unmodified hammerstones are used. In order to solve this equifinality problem, many investigations have focused their efforts on other pieces of evidence such as the identification of notches, fragmentation patterns and frequencies, among others. These studies, however, cannot be considered as fully conclusive. Within this paper we address the problem of equifinality when identifying percussion marks produced with unmodified hammerstones and tooth pits created by carnivores using new methodologies based on the 3D reconstruction of marks and their statistical multivariate analysis. For the purpose of this study a total of 128 marks– 39 percussion marks produced with an unmodified quartzite hammerstone, and 89 pits generated by different carnivores–were virtually modelled with the aid of a DAVID structured-light scanner SLS-2 and later analyzed by means of geometric morphometrics. Our results show that percussion marks not associated with striae fields and the pits generated by the carnivores studied here can be successfully distinguished. © 2018 Yravedra et al.

In regions with great taxonomic diversity, such as the Indo-Pacific, the identification of fish vertebrae to species is difficult. This results in taxonomic lists with many skeletal elements identified only to family. However family level identifications often tell us little about the environmental preferences of the fish and thus, by inference, human fishing practices. Here we apply geometric morphometrics (GM) to examine shape variations within vertebrae in modern specimens of a variety of pelagic and reef species to determine if this method can be used to reliably inform on habitat preferences. Digitized vertebral elements of reef (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae) and pelagic/open water (Scombridae and Carangidae) families were scored using 2D landmarks. These were subjected to Generalized Procrustes Analysis and discriminatory multivariate analyses (Linear Discriminant Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis) in order to assess whether shape can be used to differentiate habitats. Our results suggest that geometric morphometrics do allow the differentiation of habitat in vertebrae and provide an alternative method for the classification of archaeological fish assemblages. These analyses were applied to a sample of archaeological fish remains from a site in Alor Island (Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia) and compared with the results of an earlier traditional comparative icthyoarchaeological analysis. We found that the main component of the Pleistocene marine human diet comprised reef species, with the sporadic addition of open water species, supporting the pattern recorded with traditional analyses. This methodology could be widely applied to archaeological fish material from across the Indo-Pacific allowing a greater number of bones in assemblages to contribute to insights into human exploitation of coastal habitats and fishing techniques over time. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"Shape does matter: A geometric morphometric approach to shape variation in Indo-Pacific fish vertebrae for habitat identification","volume":"99","page start":"124","authors with affiliations":"Samper Carro, S.C., School of Archaeology and Anthropology, College of Arts and Social Sciences, Australian National UniversityACT  0200, Australia, Department of Archaeology and Natural History, College of Asia and the Pacific, Australian National UniversityACT  0200, Australia, Centre d\u0027Estudis del Patrimoni Arqueològic de la Prehistoria, Facultat de Lletres, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain; Louys, J., Australian Research Centre of Human Evolution (ARCHE), Environmental Futures Research Institute, Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia; O\u0027Connor, S., Department of Archaeology and Natural History, College of Asia and the Pacific, Australian National UniversityACT  0200, Australia, ARC Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage, Australian National UniversityACT  0200, Australia","author(s) id":"55914468200;15136337000;8707659200;","index keywords":"archaeology; fish; geometry; habitat; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Pleistocene; taxonomy; zoology; Alor Islands; East Nusa Tenggara; Lesser Sunda Islands; Sunda Isles; Acanthuridae; Balistidae; Carangidae; Gabaza; Labridae; Lethrinidae; Lutjanidae; Scombridae; Serranidae","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Fish habitat; Geometric morphometrics; Icthyoarchaeology; Vertebrae; Wallacea; Zooarchaeology","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Samper Carro S.C., Louys J., O\u0027Connor S.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2018.09.010"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Bookstein F.L., Gunz P., Mittercker P., Prossinger H., Schæfer K., Seidler H.","x":941.6749877929688,"y":-3295.334228515625,"id":"8593","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0037307376","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"2","year":"2003","page end":"187","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0037307376\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fS0047-2484%2802%2900201-4\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dfb615501d9d1e255562d15c036ac28c7","affiliations":"Institute for Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, Vienna 1091, Austria; Institute for Gerontology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States","source title":"Journal of Human Evolution","abstract":"This study addresses some enduring issues of ontogenetic and evolutionary integration in the form of the hominid cranium.

For each specimen 84 landmarks and semilandmarks were located on the midsagittal plane and converted to Procrustes shape coordinates. Integration was quantified by the method of singular warps, a new geometric-statistical approach to visualizing correlations among regions. The two classic patterns of integration, evolutionary and ontogenetic, were jointly explored by comparing analyses of overlapping subsamples that span ranges of different hypothetical factors. Evolutionary integration is expressed in the subsample of 24 adult Homo, and ontogenetic integration in the subsample of 34 H. sapiens. In this data set, vault, cranial base, and face show striking and localized patterns of covariation over ontogeny, similar but not identical to the patterns seen over evolution. The principal differences between ontogeny and phylogeny pertain to the cranial base. There is also a component of cranial to height ratio not reducible to either process.

Proponents of the single-origin model often view this group as a distinct species with little or no contribution to the evolution of modern humans. Adherents to the regional continuity model consider Neanderthals a subspecies or population of Homo sapiens, which contributed significantly to the evolution of early modern Europeans. Paleontologists generally agree that fossil species should be equivalent to extant ones in the amount of their morphological variation. Recognition of fossil species therefore hinges on analogy to living species. A previous study by one of the authors and recent work by other researchers [Schillachi, M. A. \u0026 Froelich, J. W. (2001) Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 115, 157-166] have supported specific status for Neanderthals based on analogy to chimpanzees and Sulawesi macaques, respectively. However, these taxa may not be the most appropriate models for Pleistocene humans. Here we test the hypothesis that Neanderthals represent a subspecies of H. sapiens by comparing the degree of their morphological differentiation from modern humans to that found within and between 12 species of extant primates. The model taxa comprised \u003e1,000 specimens, including phylogenetic (modern humans and African apes) and ecological (eight papionin taxa) models for Pleistocene humans. Morphological distances between model taxon pairs were compared to the distances between Neanderthals and modern humans obtained by using a randomization technique.

The evidence collected so far highlights the great variability of the species and provides a baseline to be used for the interpretation of ancient material. It is shown that not only the size, but also the shape of teeth and mandibles can help in highlighting patterns of variability in wild boar from different areas. A number of geographic trends are identified in the variation of S. scrofa across its range, mainly concerning the differentiation of insular forms, and the existence of South-North and West-East clines. Other factors such as hybridisation with domestic stock, feralisation and human-induced movement of animals may also play an important role. A comparison with ancient material emphasises the existence of similarities as well as differences between modern and ancient populations. Although some of the geographic trends identified on the basis of the analysis of modern material seem to date back to early Holocene times, the morphological history of the species appears to be complex, and in more than one area fluctuations in body size seem to have occurred. © 2009 Maney Publishing.","source":"Scopus","title":"Size and shape of the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), with a view to the reconstruction of its Holocene history","volume":"14","page start":"103","authors with affiliations":"Albarella, U., Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S1 4ET, United Kingdom; Dobney, K., Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom; Rowley-Conwy, P., Department of Archaeology, University of Durham, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"8267110000;6602595568;57204378841;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Biometry; Bones; Teeth; Wild boar; Zooarchaeology; Zoogeography","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Albarella U., Dobney K., Rowley-Conwy P.","doi":"10.1179/146141009X12481709928283"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Rohlf F.J.","x":264.2381896972656,"y":2503.792236328125,"id":"8382","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-46749110881","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.012371134020618556","authors with affiliations":"Rohlf, F.J.","Modularity Class":"6","year":"2006","publication stage":"Final","source title":"TpsDig, Version 2.10","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"6.0","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Rohlf F.J."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":29.279998779296875},{"label":"Eren M.I., Lycett S.J.","x":3485.303955078125,"y":463.2516174316406,"id":"9143","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84856112566","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.010309278350515464","Modularity Class":"5","issue":"1","year":"2012","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84856112566\u0026doi\u003d10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0029273\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d6f86dd90408d39a185a8ff9d0449f3fc","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, United Kingdom","access type":"Open Access","source title":"PLoS ONE","abstract":"Background: Middle Palaeolithic stone artefacts referred to as \u0027Levallois\u0027 have caused considerable debate regarding issues of technological predetermination, cognition and linguistic capacities in extinct hominins. Their association with both Neanderthals and early modern humans has, in particular, fuelled such debate. Yet, controversy exists regarding the extent of \u0027predetermination\u0027 and \u0027standardization\u0027 in so-called \u0027preferential Levallois flakes\u0027 (PLFs). Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an experimental and morphometric approach, we assess the degree of standardization in PLFs compared to the flakes produced during their manufacture. PLFs possess specific properties that unite them robustly as a group or \u0027category\u0027 of flake. The properties that do so, relate most strongly to relative flake thicknesses across their surface area. PLFs also exhibit significantly less variability than the flakes generated during their production. Again, this is most evident in flake thickness variables. A further aim of our study was to assess whether the particular PLF attributes identified during our analyses can be related to current knowledge regarding flake functionality and utility. Conclusions/Significance: PLFs are standardized in such a manner that they may be considered \u0027predetermined\u0027 with regard to a specific set of properties that distinguishes them statistically from a majority of other flakes. Moreover, their attributes can be linked to factors that, based on current knowledge, are desirable features in flake tools (e.g. durability, capacity for retouch, and reduction of torque). As such, our results support the hypothesis that the lengthy, multi-phase, and hierarchically organized process of Levallois reduction was a deliberate, engineered strategy orientated toward specific goals. In turn, our results support suggestions that Levallois knapping relied on a cognitive capacity for long-term working memory. This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that cognitive distinctions between later Pleistocene hominins such as the Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans were not as sharp as some scholars have previously suggested. © 2012 Eren, Lycett.","source":"Scopus","title":"Why Levallois?

This practice results in confusions when large-scale assemblage comparisons are made with the aim of investigating phylogenetic relationships, as functional and cultural information is aggregated.

The subject of this article is a quantitative method for extracting and comparing resharpening trajectories. The method is an adaptation of ontogenetic scaling methods from biology, and is based on obtaining a mathematical representation of shape and size, and finding a relationship between the two. Elliptical Fourier analysis is applied to stone tool contours in order to extract shape information, and then a series of regressions of shape on size provide trajectory vectors. The angles between these are then calculated and subjected to a variety of multivariate statistical tests. A case study involving several European Middle Paleolithic bifacial and unifacial tool assemblages is presented.

Eleven statistical techniques are evaluated in reference to one broadly interspecific data set (craniometries of adult Old World monkeys) and one narrowly intraspecific data set (anthropometries of adult Native American males). Three different types of residuals are compared to three versions of shape ratios, and these are contrasted to “cscores,” Penrose shape, and multivariate adjustments based on the first principal component of the logged variance‐covariance matrix; all methods are also compared to raw and logged raw data. In order to help us identify appropriate; methods for size‐adjustment, geometrically similar or “isometric” versions of the male vervet and the Inuit male were created by scalar multiplication of all variables. The geometric mean of all variables is used as overall “size” throughout this investigation, but our conclusions would be the same for most other size variables. Residual adjustments failed to correctly identify individuals of the same shape in both sampkles. Like residuals, cscores are also sample‐specific and incorrectly attribute different shape values to individuals known to be identical in shape. Multivariate “residuals” (e.g., discarding the first principal component and Burnaby\u0027s method) are plagued by similar problems. If one of the goals of an analysis is to identify individuals (OTUs) of the same shape after accounting for overalll size differences, then none of these methods can be recommended. We also reject the assertion that size‐adjusted variables should be unciorrelated with size of “size‐free”; rather, whether or not shape covaries with size is an important empirical determination in any analysis. Without explicit similarity criteria, “lines of subtraction” can be very misleading. Only variables in the Mosimann family of shape rations allowed us to identify sized individuals of the same shape (“Iso‐OUTs”). Residuals from isometric lines in logarithmic space, projections of logged data to a plane orthogonal to an isometric vector, and Penrose shape distance based on logged data are also part of this shape family. Shape defined in this manner can be significantly correlated with size in allometric data sets (e.g., guenon craniometrics); ratio shape differences may be largely independent of size in narrowly intraspecific or intrasexual data sets (e.g., Native American anthropometrics).

Homology is similarity because of common descent and ancestry, homoplasy is similarity arrived at via independent evolution. However, given that there is but one tree of life, all organisms, and therefore all features of organisms, share some degree of relationship and similarity one to another. That sharing may be similarity or even identity of structure and the sharing of a most recent common ancestor - as in the homology of the arms of humans and apes - or it may reflect some (often small) degree of similarity, such as that between the wings of insects and the wings of birds, groups whose shared ancestor lies deep within the evolutionary history of the Metazoa. It may reflect sharing of entire developmental pathways, partial sharing, or divergent pathways. This review compares features classified as homologous with the classes of features normally grouped as homoplastic, the latter being convergence, parallelism, reversals, rudiments, vestiges, and atavisms. On the one hand, developmental mechanisms may be conserved, even when a complete structure does not form (rudiments, vestiges), or when a structure appears only in some individuals (atavisms). On the other hand, different developmental mechanisms can produce similar (homologous) features. Joint examination of nearness of relationship and degree of shared development reveals a continuum within an expanded category of homology, extending from homology → reversals → rudiments → vestiges → atavisms → parallelism, with convergence as the only class of homoplasy, an idea that turns out to be surprisingly old. This realignment provides a glimmer of a way to bridge phylogenetic and developmental approaches to homology and homoplasy, a bridge that should provide a key pillar for evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo). It will not, and in a practical sense cannot, alter how homoplastic features are identified in phylogenetic analyses. But seeing rudiments, reversals, vestiges, atavisms and parallelism as closer to homology than to homoplasy should guide us toward searching for the common elements underlying the formation of the phenotype (what some have called the deep homology of genetic and/or cellular mechanisms), rather than discussing features in terms of shared or independent evolution.","source":"Scopus","title":"Descent with modification: The unity underlying homology and homoplasy as seen through an analysis of development and evolution","volume":"78","page start":"409","authors with affiliations":"Hall, B.K., Department of Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","author(s) id":"57203106489;","index keywords":"embryo development; evolutionary homology; eye development; homoplasy; human; lens; natural selection; nonhuman; regeneration; review; Animals; Biodiversity; Developmental Biology; Evolution; Models, Biological; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Selection (Genetics); Species Specificity; Aves; Hexapoda; Metazoa","document type":"Review","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Atavisms; Convergence; Descent with modification; Embryonic development; Evolution; Homology; Homoplasy; Parallelism; Reversals; Rudiments; Vestiges","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Hall B.K.","doi":"10.1017/S1464793102006097"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"MacLeod N.","x":1402.39111328125,"y":3726.58642578125,"id":"9321","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85055626269","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.004123711340206186","Modularity Class":"6","year":"2018","page end":"348","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85055626269\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.quascirev.2018.08.024\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dc71b8447562d5ab09c09cb3e4fcfe3d2","affiliations":"The Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London, SW7 5BD, United Kingdom; Department of Earth Sciences, University College, London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom; Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 39 Beijing, Donglu, Nanjing, China","source title":"Quaternary Science Reviews","abstract":"Archaeologists often wish to distinguish between groups of cultural artifacts using information collected from descriptions or measurements of their morphological forms. Morphometric methods have played an increasingly large role in such quantitative assessments. However, standard approaches to morphometric analyses are often poorly suited to many artifact types as much variation of interest to archeologists cannot be quantified adequately by sparse sets of landmarks or semilandmarks. Use of measurement conventions also requires that investigators know which aspects of the artifacts under consideration are important to include at the outset of an investigation. In this review results obtained from landmark-semilandmark-based, and image pixel-based assessments of a common set of Paleoindian fluted projectile points are compared. Results confirm that, by itself, PCA is unsuited for the assessment of between-group differences irrespective of data type, but can be useful as a transformation to reduce the dimensionality of a morphological dataset while retaining its effective information content. Landmark-semilandmark data analysed using geometric morphometric methods delivered the lowest-quality results whereas image pixel data analysed by the Naïve Bayes machine-learning classifier delivered the highest. Direct analyses of artifact images using geometric morphometric methods delivered very good results. These findings suggest that the direct analyses of digital images and 3D scans, using either geometric morphometric data-analysis methods or machine-learning procedures, can provide archaeologists with tools that improve and extend the scope of their assessments of a wide range of artifact types. © 2018","source":"Scopus","title":"The quantitative assessment of archaeological artifact groups: Beyond geometric morphometrics","volume":"201","page start":"319","authors with affiliations":"MacLeod, N., The Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London, SW7 5BD, United Kingdom, Department of Earth Sciences, University College, London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 39 Beijing, Donglu, Nanjing, China","author(s) id":"57200347364;","index keywords":"Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data reduction; Discriminant analysis; Geometry; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Metadata; Pixels; Projectiles; Morphometrics; North America; Paleogeography; Paleoindian; Quaternary; Typology; Image analysis; archaeology; artifact; data assimilation; discriminant analysis; geometry; machine learning; morphometry; paleogeography; pixel; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; typology","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Data analysis; Discriminant analysis; Machine learning; Morphometrics; North America; Paleogeography; Paleoindian; Projectile points; Quaternary; Typology","pr_indegree":"2.0","authors":"MacLeod N.","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.08.024"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":13.760000228881836},{"label":"Smith H.L., Smallwood A.M., Dewitt T.J.","x":765.633056640625,"y":2397.866455078125,"id":"9180","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84937131457","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","Modularity Class":"6","year":"2014","page end":"180","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84937131457\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d322fd2cf6c1036691a740ae2dcea7d4a","affiliations":"Center for the Study of the First Americans, Department of Anthropology, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, United States; Department of Anthropology, University of West Georgia, Carrollton, GA, United States; Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, United States","source title":"Clovis: On the Edge of a New Understanding","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Defining the normative range of Clovis fluted point shape using geographic models of geometric morphometric variation","page start":"161","authors with affiliations":"Smith, H.L., Center for the Study of the First Americans, Department of Anthropology, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, United States; Smallwood, A.M., Department of Anthropology, University of West Georgia, Carrollton, GA, United States; Dewitt, T.J., Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, United States","author(s) id":"55805377100;36085157600;7005129580;","document type":"Book Chapter","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Smith H.L., Smallwood A.M., Dewitt T.J."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"McNabb J., Binyon F., Hazelwood L.","x":4769.29638671875,"y":-218.57339477539062,"id":"8567","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33747638080","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"5","year":"2004","page end":"677","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-33747638080\u0026doi\u003d10.1086%2f423973\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d0852887a01dff220ba1ba5d234414bdb","affiliations":"Centre for Archaeology of Human Origins, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BF, United Kingdom","source title":"Current Anthropology","abstract":"Handaxes and cleavers are the keystone of the Acheulean, a stone-tool-making phenomenon which was made for over a million years (ca. \u003c 1.7 to \u003c 0.25 million years).

Usually these analyses have been performed by means of classic morphometric methods, including the measurement of relative cusp areas or the angles defined between cusps. Although these studies have provided valuable information for the morphological characterization of some hominin species, we believe that the analysis of this particular tooth could be more conclusive for taxonomic assignment. In this study, we have applied geometric morphometric methods to explore the morphological variability of the upper first molar (M1) across the human fossil record. Our emphasis focuses on the study of the phenetic relationships among the European middle Pleistocene populations (designated as H. heidelbergensis) with H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, but the inclusion of Australopithecus and early Homo specimens has helped us to assess the polarity of the observed traits. H. neanderthalensis presents a unique morphology characterized by a relatively distal displacement of the lingual cusps and protrusion in the external outline of a large and bulging hypocone. This morphology can be found in a less pronounced degree in the European early and middle Pleistocene populations, and reaches its maximum expression with the H. neanderthalensis lineage. In contrast, modern humans retain the primitive morphology with a square occlusal polygon associated with a round external outline. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This pilot study aims to deliver a new method that goes beyond mirror imaging, giving the possibility to reconstruct crania characterized by large missing areas, which might be useful in the fields of paleoanthropology, bioarcheology, and forensics. We test the accuracy of digital reconstructions in cases where two-thirds or more of a human cranium were missing. A three-dimensional (3D) virtual model of a human cranium was virtually damaged twice to compare two destruction-reconstruction scenarios. In the first case, a small fraction of the midsagittal region was still preserved, allowing the application of mirror imaging techniques. In the second case, the damage affected the complete midsagittal region, which demands a new approach to estimate the position of the midsagittal plane. Reconstructions were carried out using CT scans from a sample of modern humans (12 males and 13 females), to which 3D digital modeling techniques and geometric morphometric methods were applied. As expected, the second simulation showed a larger variability than the first one, which underlines the fact that the individual midsagittal plane is of course preferable in order to minimize the reconstruction error. However, in both simulations the Procrustes mean shape was an effective reference for the reconstruction of the entire cranium, producing models that showed a remarkably low error of about 3 mm, given the extent of missing data. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Virtual Reconstruction of Very Large Skull Defects Featuring Partly and Completely Missing Midsagittal Planes","volume":"296","page start":"745","authors with affiliations":"Senck, S., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Coquerelle, M., Department of Paleobiology, Paleoanthropology group, Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCM-CSIC), C/José Gutiérrez Abascal 2, Madrid, 28006, Spain; Weber, G.W., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, 1090 Vienna, Austria; Benazzi, S., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz 6, Leipzig, 04103, Germany","author(s) id":"36188870600;36140239700;56370482200;24068504800;","index keywords":"archeology; article; computer assisted tomography; female; forensic science; human; image reconstruction; male; paleoanthropology; priority journal; sex difference; skull; skull defect; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Fossils; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Sex Characteristics; Skull; Young Adult; Crania","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Cranial reconstruction; Geometric morphometrics; Mirror imaging; Virtual anthropology","pr_indegree":"1.0","authors":"Senck S., Coquerelle M., Weber G.W., Benazzi S.","doi":"10.1002/ar.22693"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":9.880000114440918},{"label":"Gunz P., Neubauer S., Maureille B., Hublin J.-J.","x":-828.3837280273438,"y":-4007.81640625,"id":"9102","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-78149327133","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"21","year":"2010","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-78149327133\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.cub.2010.10.018\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dc58cb87aef1bcd1dffbca18fdbe4c152","affiliations":"Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Deutscher Platz 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Université de Bordeaux, Laboratoire d\u0027Anthropologie des Populations du Passé, CNRS Université Bordeaux 1, F-33405 Talence cedex, France","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Current Biology","abstract":"Neanderthals had brain sizes comparable to modern humans, but their brain cases were elongated and not globular as in Homo sapiens [1,2].

In this study, samples of modern and prehistoric hunter–gatherers and agriculturalists are used to test the hypothesis that there are systematic differences in patterns of tooth wear related to major differences in subsistence and food preparation. Flatness of molar wear is compared for five groups of hunter–gatherers (N \u003d 298) and five groups of early agriculturalists (N \u003d 365). Hunter–gatherers are predicted to develop flatter molar wear due to the mastication of tough and fibrous foods, whereas agriculturalists should develop oblique molar wear due to an increase in the proportion of ground and prepared food in the diet. A method is presented for the quantitative measurement and analysis of flatness of molar wear. Comparisons of wear plane angle are made between teeth matched for the same stage of occlusal surface wear, thus standardizing all groups to the same rate of wear. Agriculturalists develop highly angled occlusal wear planes on the entire molar dentition. Their wear plane angles tend to exceed hunter–gatherers by about 10° in advanced wear.

Today, they are widely spread and represent a major pest to local human populations. This complex, therefore, represents an accurate model for investigating the roles of climate change and human impact in shaping Quaternary faunal diversity and distribution. Many gray areas still exist regarding the systematics, ecology and geographical distribution of this complex, for both present and past populations. The purpose of this study is to compare modern genotyped and fossil Meriones specimens in order to 1) clarify the current systematics and distribution of the Meriones populations of the shawii/grandis complex, 2) document the taxonomic diversity in fossil Meriones from northwestern Africa, and 3) track their phenotypic and biogeographic evolution through time. To answer these questions we used geometric morphometrics on skulls (landmarks) and first upper molars (landmarks and sliding landmarks). We evidenced the existence of two morpho-groups within the M. shawii/grandis complex, with a clear geographic pattern (M. grandis in Morocco vs. M. shawii in Algeria and Tunisia). Currently only one morpho-group, attributed to M. grandis, seems to exist in Morocco, with a small overlap with M. shawii in the most eastern part of the country. However, according to fossil data, M. shawii was also present in Atlantic Morocco during the Late Pleistocene. We have also highlighted the impact of Holocene climate change and habitat anthropization on this arid adapted group. During the Middle Holocene, a major climatic event (last interglacial optimum) seems to have induced a demographic collapse in Moroccan populations and the disappearance of the shawii clade from Morocco (except in the most eastern areas). Both species then re-expanded, benefitting from the increasing aridity and the new ecological niche driven by agriculture dispersal from the Neolithic onwards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"Systematics and evolution of the Meriones shawii/grandis complex (Rodentia, Gerbillinae) during the Late Quaternary in northwestern Africa: Exploring the role of environmental and anthropogenic changes","volume":"164","page start":"199","authors with affiliations":"Stoetzel, E., HNHP UMR 7194, CNRS, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités, UPVD, Musée de l\u0027Homme, Palais de Chaillot, 17 place du Trocadéro, Paris, 75016, France; Cornette, R., ISyEB UMR 7205, CNRS, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités - UPMC - EPHE, CP 51, 55 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France; Lalis, A., ISyEB UMR 7205, CNRS, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités - UPMC - EPHE, CP 51, 55 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France; Nicolas, V., ISyEB UMR 7205, CNRS, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités - UPMC - EPHE, CP 51, 55 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France; Cucchi, T., Archéozoologie, CNRS, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités, Archéobotanique UMR 7209, CP 56, 55 rue Buffon, Paris, France; Denys, C., ISyEB UMR 7205, CNRS, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités - UPMC - EPHE, CP 51, 55 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France","author(s) id":"23111731600;6506350460;15136229600;14825723800;6506822509;7006755120;","index keywords":"Climate models; Ecology; Geographical distribution; Mammals; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Anthropic impact; Geometric morphometrics; Gerbillinae; Holocenes; Late Pleistocene; Maghreb; Climate change; abundance; anthropogenic effect; archaeology; climate variation; environmental change; fossil record; geographical distribution; geometry; Holocene; morphometry; paleobiogeography; Pleistocene; rodent; species complex; Morocco; North Africa; Gerbillinae; Meriones; Rodentia","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Anthropic impact; Climate change; Geometric morphometrics; Gerbillinae; Holocene; Late Pleistocene; Maghreb","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Stoetzel E., Cornette R., Lalis A., Nicolas V., Cucchi T., Denys C.","doi":"10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.04.002"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Archer W., Braun D.R.","x":5029.654296875,"y":8.898775100708008,"id":"8432","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-70350780084","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.030927835051546393","Modularity Class":"5","issue":"1","year":"2010","page end":"209","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-70350780084\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2009.09.033\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d05d7b51b183bf76a6ead7d77733b1a4a","affiliations":"Department of Archaeology, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, 7701 Western Cape, South Africa","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"This study applies a new three-dimensional measurement technique to determine the major source of variation in the Acheulian bifacial tool collection from the Middle Pleistocene site of Elandsfontein, South Africa.

Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace.

Analyses of incremental features in teeth provide an accurate means of assessing the age at death of developing dentitions, facilitating direct comparisons with fossil and modern humans. It is currently unknown when and where the prolonged modern human developmental condition originated. Here, an application of x-ray synchrotron microtomography reveals that an early Homo sapiens juvenile from Morocco dated at 160,000 years before present displays an equivalent degree of tooth development to modern European children at the same age. Crown formation times in the juvenile\u0027s macrodont dentition are higher than modern human mean values, whereas root development is accelerated relative to modern humans but is less than living apes and some fossil hominins. The juvenile from Jebel Irhoud is currently the oldest-known member of Homo with a developmental pattern (degree of eruption, developmental stage, and crown formation time) that is more similar to modern H. sapiens than to earlier members of Homo.

The Acheulian data set is based on previously published data with the addition here of a study of the handaxes from the site of Boxgrove, England. The MTA data set is based on four classic sites from southwest France with large handaxe collections. Both standard caliper-based morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis applied to coordinate data taken from digitized images of handaxes are used to assess shape. The result is that, contrary to expectations based on assumptions of evolving technological skill, handaxes in the MTA are as or more variable in shape than Acheulian ones. This variation is allometric in Acheulian handaxes, and is linked to resharpening from the tip down to the base, but is not related to size in the MTA samples. These results suggest that the goals and constraints of handaxe manufacture, but particularly handaxe reduction as a result of reworking during use, were quite different in the MTA and Acheulian, implying that conclusions about hominin cognition drawn from patterns in shape variability in handaxes must be understood in the context of artifact life histories. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"The handaxe reloaded: A morphometric reassessment of Acheulian and Middle Paleolithic handaxes","volume":"61","authors with affiliations":"Iovita, R., Forschungsbereich Altsteinzeit, Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz, Schloß Monrepos, D-56567 Neuwied, Germany; McPherron, S.P., Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","author(s) id":"6506567945;6506777264;","index keywords":"Acheulean; artifact; hominid; life history; morphometry; Paleolithic","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Acheulian; Boxgrove; Elliptical Fourier analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Handaxe; Life-history; MTA; Shape variability","pr_indegree":"7.0","authors":"Iovita R., McPherron S.P.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.02.007"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":33.15999984741211},{"label":"Terral J.-F., Newton C., Ivorra S., Gros-Balthazard M., de Morais C.T., Picq S., Tengberg M., Pintaud J.-C.","x":40.83024215698242,"y":193.05050659179688,"id":"8698","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84859839004","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"1","issue":"5","year":"2012","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84859839004\u0026doi\u003d10.1111%2fj.1365-2699.2011.02649.x\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003db0df9eebe11ef63001475d5e7f2d0689","affiliations":"Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie, UMR 5059 CNRS/Université Montpellier 2/EPHE/INRAP, Institut de Botanique, 163 Rue Auguste Broussonet, 34090 Montpellier, France; Université Montpellier 2, Place Eugène Bataillon, 34095 Montpellier, France; Department of Archaeology, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, United Kingdom; UMR DIADE, équipe DYNADIV, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, 911 Avenue Agropolis, 34394 Montpellier, France; Archéozoologie Archéobotanique: Sociétés, Pratiques et Environnements (UMR 7209 CNRS/MNHN Paris), 55 Rue Buffon - CP 56, 75005 Paris, France; Laboratoire d\u0027Archéologie et de Patrimoine, Université du Québec à Rimouski, 300 allée des Ursulines, Rimouski, QC G5L 3AI, Canada; Ecosystem Management, Department of Environmental Science, ETH Zürich, Universitätstrasse 16, Zurich 8092, Switzerland","source title":"Journal of Biogeography","abstract":"Aim The main purpose of this work is to understand the origin, history, historical biogeography and mechanisms of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) domestication. Location Seeds of uncultivated Phoenix individuals from isolated Oman populations, cultivated date palm varieties of various geographical origins and other related Phoenix species were analysed. Additionally, well-preserved seeds from Egyptian archaeological sites (14th century bc to 8th century ad) were compared with the morphometric reference model based on the analysis of modern material. Methods Elliptic Fourier transforms (EFT), a morphometric method applied to shape outline analysis, were used to characterize seed shape and to quantify morphological diversity in P. dactylifera and related species. Results Analysis of seed outlines by EFT (1) showed that P. dactylifera can be differentiated from other Phoenix species and (2) enabled the quantification of patterns of shape differentiation in the genus Phoenix at different taxonomic, geographical and chronological levels. Date palm agrobiodiversity, partitioned in distinct morphotypes, appeared to be complex in terms of geographical structure. Allocation of archaeological seeds to different modern Phoenix forms and date palm morphotypes allowed us to reveal ancient forms consumed and/or exploited in Egypt and finally to determine spatial and temporal changes in agrobiodiversity. Main conclusions Based on the morphological diversity quantified in P. dactylifera and related species, we characterized ancestral seed shape features present in uncultivated populations. The geographical distribution pattern of seed shapes points to human dispersal routes that spread cultivation from one or more initial \u0027domestication centres\u0027. Finally, this work provides a powerful tool to identify ancient forms as demonstrated by the analysis of well-preserved Egyptian archaeological seeds, dating from the 14th century bc to the 8th century ad.

Mice remains collected from a Chalcolithic burnt house in southern Romania, provided a unique opportunity to document which of the two house mouse subspecies was the commensal taxa of the late Neolithic Romania and question the factors of its invasive process. To obtain the subspecific status of the Mus remains, we performed molar shape analysis with geometric morphometrics, using 160 specimens sampling the extant Eastern European Mus taxa as modern comparatives. Along with an overwhelming majority of eastern house mice (Mus musculus musculus) living constantly in the Chalcolithic house, indigenous small mammals (common hamster, field mice, voles and white toothed shrews) were also occupying the settlement sporadically, highlighting the antiquity of the synanthropisation of European small mammals. This secured occurrence of the eastern house mouse in late Neolithic Romania, led us to propose two testable research hypotheses: first, an eastern house mouse commensalism center in Eastern Europe happening during the sixth millennium BC, when neolithization reached the natural distribution of free living populations of Mus musculus musculus in the Pontic steppes of Ukraine;

This paper presents one such case study: Niah Cave in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, famous for the discovery in 1958 in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of a modern human skull, the \u0027Deep Skull,\u0027 controversially associated with radiocarbon dates of ca. 40,000 years before the present. A new chronostratigraphy has been developed through a re-investigation of the lithostratigraphy left by the earlier excavations, AMS-dating using three different comparative pre-treatments including ABOX of charcoal, and U-series using the Diffusion-Absorption model applied to fragments of bones from the Deep Skull itself. Stratigraphic reasons for earlier uncertainties about the antiquity of the skull are examined, and it is shown not to be an \u0027intrusive\u0027 artifact. It was probably excavated from fluvial-pond-desiccation deposits that accumulated episodically in a shallow basin immediately behind the cave entrance lip, in a climate that ranged from times of comparative aridity with complete desiccation, to episodes of greater surface wetness, changes attributed to regional climatic fluctuations. Vegetation outside the cave varied significantly over time, including wet lowland forest, montane forest, savannah, and grassland. The new dates and the lithostratigraphy relate the Deep Skull to evidence of episodes of human activity that range in date from ca. 46,000 to ca. 34,000 years ago. Initial investigations of sediment scorching, pollen, palynomorphs, phytoliths, plant macrofossils, and starch grains recovered from existing exposures, and of vertebrates from the current and the earlier excavations, suggest that human foraging during these times was marked by habitat-tailored hunting technologies, the collection and processing of toxic plants for consumption, and, perhaps, the use of fire at some forest-edges. The Niah evidence demonstrates the sophisticated nature of the subsistence behavior developed by modern humans to exploit the tropical environments that they encountered in Southeast Asia, including rainforest. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Paleomagnetic analyses, biostratigraphical studies, and quantitative data obtained through nuclide cosmogenic methods, place this specimen in the Early Pleistocene (1.2-1.3 Ma). This finding, together with archaeological evidence from different European sites, suggests that Western Europe was colonised shortly after the first hominin expansion out of Africa around the Olduvai subchron. Our analysis of the ATE9-1 mandible includes a geometric morphometric analysis of the lower second premolar (LP4), a combined and detailed external and internal assessment of ATE9-1 roots through CT and microCT techniques, as well as a comparative study of mandibular and other dental features. This analysis reveals some primitive Homo traits on the external aspect of the symphysis and the dentition shared with early African Homo and the Dmanisi hominins. In contrast, other mandibular traits on the internal aspect of the symphysis are derived with regard to African early Homo, indicating unexpectedly large departures from patterns observed in Africa. Reaching the most occidental part of the Eurasian continent implies that the first African emigrants had to cross narrow corridors and to overcome geographic barriers favouring genetic drift, long isolation periods, and adaptation to new climatic and seasonal conditions. Given these conditions and that we are dealing with a long time period, it is possible that one or more speciation events could have occurred in this extreme part of Eurasia during the Early Pleistocene, originating in the lineages represented by the Sima del Elefante-TE9 hominins and possibly by the Gran Dolina-TD6 hominins.

It consists of a newly developed tool for automated positioning of 3D digital models and the following placement of 3D homologous landmarks for geometric morphometric analysis. It provides a quick and easy method for acquiring high-resolution 3D landmark coordinate data. This tool is applicable to a wide range of objects which have two opposed faces of relatively similar size and can be consistently positioned along their maximal length in planform view. The acquired data can be subjected to common multivariate statistical procedures for the quantitative description and analysis of shape variability in an assemblage. The method is applied here to a case study of experimentally produced assemblages of Acheulian handaxe replicas made by six knappers of differing skill levels. An analysis is performed to test whether the shapes of the handaxes can be used to classify them according to their knapper\u0027s skill level. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA) are applied to the landmarks\u0027 coordinates. The results indicate that applying DA to PC scores allows a reliable classification of artifacts according to the skill level of their knappers, with a minimal misclassification rate. Thus, this method demonstrates that application of high-resolution 3D geometric morphometric methods can be used for the quantitative differentiation of skill levels based on tool morphology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"A new method for 3D geometric morphometric shape analysis: The case study of handaxe knapping skill","volume":"14","page start":"163","authors with affiliations":"Herzlinger, G., Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mt.

Some cranial regions, particularly the face and neurocranium, are believed to be influenced by the environment and prone to convergence. Others, such as the temporal bone, are thought to reflect more accurately phylogenetic relationships. Direct testing of these hypotheses was not possible until the advent of large genetic data sets. The few relevant studies in human populations have had intriguing but possibly conflicting results, probably partly due to methodological differences and to the small numbers of populations used. Here we use three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics methods to test explicitly the ability of cranial shape, size, and relative position/orientation of cranial regions to track population history and climate. Morphological distances among 13 recent human populations were calculated from four 3D landmark data sets, respectively reflecting facial, neurocranial, and temporal bone shape; shape and relative position; overall cranial shape; and centroid sizes. These distances were compared to neutral genetic and climatic distances among the same, or closely matched, populations. Results indicate that neurocranial and temporal bone shape track neutral genetic distances, while facial shape reflects climate; centroid size shows a weak association with climatic variables; and relative position/orientation of cranial regions does not appear correlated with any of these factors.

We study the shell shape of the species comparing present day\u0027s specimens from the harbor zone with those collected in the same zone before the increasing of maritime activity and pre-Hispanic archaeological Middens. We demonstrated that harbor pollution produces globular shell shape in B. globulosus, an effect that probably allows gastropods to isolate themselves from the external adverse environment. On the contrary, shells from pre-Hispanic periods, unpolluted sites and those collected before the expansion of maritime activities, presented an elongated shell shape. Our study confirms that shell shape variation in marine gastropods can be used as a biomarker of harbor pollution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"Shell shape as a biomarker of marine pollution historic increase","volume":"114","page start":"816","authors with affiliations":"Márquez, F., LARBIM, Instituto de Biología de Organismos Marinos (IBIOMAR-CCT CONICET-CENPAT), Blvd. Brown 2915 (U9120ACD), Puerto Madryn, Argentina, UNPSJB — Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Blvd. Brown 3100, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; Primost, M.A., LARBIM, Instituto de Biología de Organismos Marinos (IBIOMAR-CCT CONICET-CENPAT), Blvd. Brown 2915 (U9120ACD), Puerto Madryn, Argentina; Bigatti, G., LARBIM, Instituto de Biología de Organismos Marinos (IBIOMAR-CCT CONICET-CENPAT), Blvd. Brown 2915 (U9120ACD), Puerto Madryn, Argentina, UNPSJB — Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Blvd. Brown 3100, Puerto Madryn, Argentina","author(s) id":"14832998300;26026486400;6603270408;","index keywords":"Biomarkers; Molluscs; Shells (structures); Adverse environment; Gastropod shell; Geometric morphometrics; Maritime activities; Maritime industry; Morphological changes; Patagonia; Shape variations; Marine pollution; biomarker; gastropod; marine pollution; morphology; morphometry; shell; animal behavior; animal shell; archeology; Article; Buccinanops globulosus; controlled study; environmental impact; gastropod; Hispanic; history; human activities; marine environment; morphology; nonhuman; sea pollution; shell shape; water pollution indicator; analysis; animal; Argentina; body size; drug effects; environmental monitoring; gastropod; growth, development and aging; physiology; procedures; reproduction; toxicity; water pollutant; Atlantic Ocean; Nuevo Gulf; Patagonia; Gastropoda; biological marker; organotin compound; water pollutant; Animals; Argentina; Biomarkers; Body Size; Environmental Monitoring; Gastropoda; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Reproduction; Trialkyltin Compounds; Water Pollutants, Chemical","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Gastropod shell; Geometric morphometrics; Harbor pollution; Patagonia","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Márquez F., Primost M.A., Bigatti G.","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.11.018"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"White T., Folkens P.","x":-436.3792724609375,"y":-1428.253173828125,"id":"9318","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85013823175","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"4","year":"2005","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85013823175\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fC2009-0-00102-0\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d21da982a376225f2140bfad1bfd54fd5","affiliations":"Human Evolution Research Center (HERC), The Department of Integrative Biology, The University of California, Berkeley, CA, United States","source title":"The Human Bone Manual","abstract":"Tim White and Pieter Folkens, the team behind the bestselling text, Human Osteology, Second Edition, have created the ideal concise guide for professional anthropologists, osteologists, law enforcement officers, and forensic specialists working with human bones in the field or laboratory.

However, at the onset of the Middle Postclassic (1200–1400 AD) only few individuals still exhibit clear signs of ACM. Some authors have suggested that, rather than disappearing entirely, ACM may have become less visible anatomically, making it difficult to identify based on simple visual analyses. Here, we used 3D geometric morphometric methods to investigate the extent to which ACM persisted during the Postclassic in this region. Materials and methods: We measured the 3D vault\u0027s shape changes in a sample of surface-scanned human crania: 55 individuals from the Postclassic Zacapu basin and a control group of 31 individuals from a Huichol Mexican Indian sample and a French medieval series from La Granède. We used a principal component analysis to explore the shape variation within the sample and employed the neighbor joining method to identify morphological groups. Finally, we quantified each individual\u0027s asymmetry. Results: We identified three groups displaying shape features diverging from those of the control group. The first group is characterized by marked fronto-obelionic ACM, whereas the other two show mild forms of ACM. The individuals in all three groups display moderate to high degrees of asymmetry compared to the control group. Discussion: The marked fronto-obelionic modification is clear evidence of a specific ACM technique. The two types of mild ACM most likely result from different techniques but their moderate degree of modification brings into question the intentions behind their production. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Neurocranial shape variation among Tarascan populations: Evidence for varying degrees in artificially modified crania in pre-Hispanic West Mexico (1200–1400 AD)","volume":"170","page start":"418","authors with affiliations":"Natahi, S., Université de Bordeaux, CNRS, MCC, UMR 5199 PACEA, Pessac, France; Coquerelle, M., Department of Medicine and Surgery (Stomatology Area), Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Alcorcón, Spain; Pereira, G., UMR 8096, Archéologie des Amériques, CNRS, Maison René-Ginouvès, Nanterre, France; Bayle, P., Université de Bordeaux, CNRS, MCC, UMR 5199 PACEA, Pessac, France","author(s) id":"57210429853;36140239700;36192143700;35434353800;","index keywords":"adult; archeology; article; brain; controlled study; female; Hispanic; human; human experiment; human tissue; major clinical study; male; Mexico; Middle Ages; morphometry; neighbor joining method; principal component analysis","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"3D geometric morphometrics; artificial cranial modification; asymmetry; Mesoamerican Archaeology","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Natahi S., Coquerelle M., Pereira G., Bayle P.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.23917"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Ferembach D., Schwidetzky I., Stloukal M.","x":-136.09347534179688,"y":-765.0111694335938,"id":"8996","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0000884253","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","Modularity Class":"4","year":"1980","page end":"549","source title":"J Hum Evol","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Recommendations for age and sex diagnoses of skeletons","volume":"9","page start":"517","authors with affiliations":"Ferembach, D.; Schwidetzky, I.; Stloukal, M.","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Ferembach D., Schwidetzky I., Stloukal M."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Larson G., Albarella U., Dobney K., Rowley-Conwy P., Schibler J., Tresset A., Vigne J.-D., Edwards C.J., Schlumbaum A., Dinu A., Bǎlǎçsescu A., Dolman G., Tagliacozzo A., Manaseryan N., Miracle P., Van Wijngaarden-Bakker L., Masseti M., Bradley D.G., Cooper A.","x":-987.7312622070312,"y":206.90972900390625,"id":"9223","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-34848916115","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"1","issue":"39","year":"2007","page end":"15281","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-34848916115\u0026doi\u003d10.1073%2fpnas.0703411104\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d9ae742b76950ade1c6688328621dabbe","affiliations":"Department of Zoology, Henry Wellcome Ancient Biomolecules Centre, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, United Kingdom; Department of Archaeology, Durham University, South Road, Durham DH1 3L, United Kingdom; Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala Biomedical Center, Box 597, S-751 24 Uppsala, Sweden; Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield, Northgate House, West Street, Sheffield 51 4ET, United Kingdom; Institute for Prehistory and Archaeological Science, Basel University, Spalenring 145, CH-4055 Basel, Switzerland; Department of Ecology and Biodiversity Management, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, 57 rue Cuvier, F-75231 Paris Cedex 05, France; Molecular Population Genetics, Smurfit Institute, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland; Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin, 5240 Social Science Building, 1180 Observatory Drive, Madison, WI 53706, United States; National History Museum of Romania, National Center of Pluridisciplinary Research, 12 Calea Victoriei, 30026 Bucharest, Romania; Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, University of Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; Soprintendenza Speciale al Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico L.

The oldest sites are in Africa at around 1.6 million years ago and the most recent approach the last 100,000 years. The geographical extent is also enormous, ranging across Africa, the Middle East, most of Europe and large parts of Asia. Is it however a real tradition? The Acheulean represents a set of stone-working ideas that endure, but the strength of \u0027tradition\u0027 is often an assumption made by archaeologists. This paper re-examines Acheulean biface variation, looking at sets of assemblages measured in different ways, but amenable to discriminant analysis (DFA), which is able to highlight differences useful in classification. The analyses show significant differences between European and African assemblages. In the case of the Far East, in line with others, we provide further analyses suggestive of technological differences between putative \u0027handaxes\u0027 from Korea and some \u0027classic\u0027 western assemblages. However, it is not yet fully clear how far a \u0027typical\u0027 Acheulean tradition is represented, as matching of Far Eastern assemblages to other parts of the world depends to an extent upon the criteria used. With regard to the more general Acheulean paradox, the paper notes parallels in biological studies with the idea that a single widely extending phenomenon can incorporate elements of both unity and diversity.","source":"Scopus","title":"On questions surrounding the Acheulean \u0027tradition\u0027","volume":"40","page start":"295","authors with affiliations":"Lycett, S.J., British Academy Centenary Research Project, SACE, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; Gowlett, J.A.J., British Academy Centenary Research Project, SACE, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"9434693200;6603228354;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; archaeology; cultural history; cultural tradition; discriminant analysis; documentary source; historical geography; human settlement; Paleolithic","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Acheulean; Handaxes; Movius Line; Social transmission; Traditions; Variation","pr_indegree":"7.0","authors":"Lycett S.J., Gowlett J.A.J.","doi":"10.1080/00438240802260970"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":33.15999984741211},{"label":"Shott M.","x":6.000762939453125,"y":3490.745361328125,"id":"8529","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-61749101731","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.012371134020618556","Modularity Class":"6","year":"2005","source title":"BAR International Series","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The reduction thesis and its discontents: overview of the volume","volume":"1408","authors with affiliations":"Shott, M.","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"6.0","authors":"Shott M."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":29.279998779296875},{"label":"Lycett S.J., von Cramon-Taubadel N., Foley R.A.","x":3689.298828125,"y":-2469.67041015625,"id":"8981","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33645078897","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.032989690721649485","Modularity Class":"5","issue":"6","year":"2006","page end":"861","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-33645078897\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2005.10.014\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d0941f76714b1a033debac0223bb90b3f","affiliations":"Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies, University of Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Street, Cambridge CB2 1QH, United Kingdom","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Over the last four decades, there has been surprisingly little advance in the quantitative morphometric analysis of Palaeolithic stone tools, especially compared to that which has taken place in biological morphometrics over a comparable time frame. In Palaeolithic archaeology\u0027s sister discipline of palaeoanthropology, detailed quantitative morphometric, geometric morphometric, and even 3D geometric morphometric analyses are now seen almost as routine. This period of relative methodological stasis may have been influenced by the lack of homologous landmarks on many lithic tools (essential for any comparative analysis), especially core-based technologies of the Lower Palaeolithic. Archaeological field conditions may also prohibit the use of expensive and delicate precision instruments in certain cases. Here we present a crossbeam co-ordinate caliper that - crucially - both geometrically locates and measures distances between morphologically homologous landmarks upon lithic nuclei via a single protocol. Intra- and inter-observer error tests provide evidence that error levels associated with the instrument fall within acceptable ranges. In addition, we present empirical examples of application in the form of a multivariate analysis of 55 discrete morphometric variables, and a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of co-ordinate landmark configurations derived from Pleistocene lithic nuclei (i.e. \u0027cores\u0027 sensu lato).

Certain archaeological situations, especially those dealing with the recovery and analysis of battle casualties, may raise questions about what type(s) of bladed weapon was used in a particular conflict (e.g., the battle of Kamakura, Japan, AD 1333; the battle of Wisby, Sweden, AD 1361; the battle of Towton, England, AD 1461). Little work has been done, however, on developing criteria to differentiate sword cut marks from other types of cut marks, or to distinguish between marks created by different sword types. To develop such criteria, bovine tibiae (n \u003d 7) were struck using six different types of bladed weapon and the resulting marks (n \u003d 92) were analyzed. Eight traits describing the morphology of the cut mark - such as shape, the presence and unilateral/bilateral state of flaking and feathering, the presence of bone shards, associated breaks, etc. - are defined and related to blade type used. Sword marks were found to be easily distinguishable from knife marks. The variation in marks made by different sword types is significantly correlated with differences in blade weight (p \u003c 0.0001), grip (p \u003c 0.0113), and sharpness (p ≤ 0.0179). The criteria and analyses developed and implemented in this study will be of use to researchers in forensics and osteoarchaeology who want to infer bladed weapon type from marks on bones. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Since these physical properties are integrated to accomplish that function, examining design variables and their pattern of integration or modularity is of interest to estimate the past function of a point. Here we analyze a composite sample of lithic points from southern Patagonia likely formed by arrows, thrown spears and hand-held points to test if they can be viewed as a two-module system formed by the blade and the stem, and to evaluate the degree in which shape, size, asymmetry, blade: stem length ratio, and tip angle explain the observed variance and differentiation among points supposedly aimed to accomplish different functions. To do so we performed a geometric morphometric analysis on 118 lithic points, departing from 24 two-dimensional landmark and semi landmarks placed on the point\u0027s contour. Klingenberg\u0027s covariational modularity tests were used to evaluate different modularity hypotheses, and a composite PCA including shape, size, asymmetry, blade: stem length ratio, and tip angle was used to estimate the importance of each attribute to explaining variation patterns. Results show that the blade and the stem can be seen as \"near decomposable units\" in the points integrating the studied sample. However, this modular pattern changes after removing the effects of reduction. Indeed, a resharpened point tends to show a tip/rest of the point modular pattern. The composite PCA analyses evidenced three different patterns of morphometric attributes compatible with arrows, thrown spears, and hand-held tools. Interestingly, when analyzed independently, these groups show differences in their modular organization. Our results indicate that stone tools can be approached as flexible designs, characterized by a composite set of interacting morphometric attributes, and evolving on a modular way. © 2012 Gonzalez-Jose, Charlin.","source":"Scopus","title":"Relative Importance of Modularity and Other Morphological Attributes on Different Types of Lithic Point Weapons: Assessing Functional Variations","volume":"7","authors with affiliations":"González-José, R., Unidad de Investigación en Diversidad, Sistemática y Evolución, Centro Nacional Patagónico-CONICET, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; Charlin, J., Instituto Multidisciplinario de Historia y Ciencias Humanas-CONICET, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina","author(s) id":"6602423911;26658892500;","index keywords":"Argentina; arrow; article; blade; Chile; lithic point weapon; morphometrics; prehistoric period; principal component analysis; sample; spear; stone tool; variance; weapon; History, Ancient; Humans; Principal Component Analysis; South America; Weapons","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"e48009","pr_indegree":"8.0","authors":"González-José R., Charlin J.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0048009"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":37.040000915527344},{"label":"Crezzini J., Boschin F., Boscato P., Wierer U.","x":-4541.5478515625,"y":592.3431396484375,"id":"8830","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84898796061","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"1","year":"2014","page end":"60","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84898796061\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.quaint.2013.12.056\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d87980917e71efac8ff3c973290dcda6e","affiliations":"Università di Siena, Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche, Della Terra e dell\u0027Ambiente, U.R.

A reasonable amount of wild cat remains, some bearing cut marks, were recovered during the archaeological excavations of the rock shelter site Galgenbühel/Dos de la Forca, located in South Tyrol (Adige Valley, Bolzano, Italy). The site was frequented from approximately 8500 to 7500BC cal. by Sauveterrian groups whose economy was centered on the exploitation of nearby wetlands and the forested valley bottom and slopes. The fauna comprises abundant fish remains, molluscs, pond turtles as well as mammals, the latter dominated by the beaver, the wild boar and the red deer. In the reconstruction of hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies, it often thought that carnivores were exploited primarily for their fur. The present taphonomic study was carried out to verify if the exploitation of wild cat by Mesolithic groups was related to the procurement of additional resources. The analysis of the archaeological sample regarding skeletal frequencies and cut-mark distribution was integrated by an experimental work conducted on modern cats in order to reconstruct the chaîne opératoire adopted by man for the treatment of the carcasses. The 3D digital microscope analysis provided for each stria morphometrical parameters in order to identify the origin of cut marks. The anthropic traces found in the wild cat assemblage of Galgenbühel/Dos de la Forca are only partly related to skinning.

Admixture has long been studied after molecular data. Nevertheless, few efforts have been made to explain the morphological outcome in human craniofacial samples. The Spanish-Amerindian contact can be considered a good scenario for such an analysis. Here we present a comparative analysis of craniofacial shape changes observed between two putative ancestor groups, Spanish and precontact Aztecs, and two diachronic admixed groups, corresponding to early and late colonial periods from the Mexico\u0027s Central Valley. Quantitative shape comparisons of Amerindian, Spanish, and admixed groups were used to test the expectations of quantitative genetics for admixture events. In its simplest form, this prediction states that an admixed group will present phenotypic values falling between those of both parental groups. Results show that, in general terms, although the human skull is a complex, integrated structure, the craniofacial morphology observed fits the theoretical expectations of quantitative genetics. Thus, it is predictive of population structure and history. In fact, results obtained after the craniofacial analysis are in accordance with previous molecular and historical interpretations, providing evidence that admixture is a main microevolutionary agent influencing modern Mexican gene pool. However, expectations are not straightforward when moderate shape changes are considered. Deviations detected at localized structures, such as the upper and lower face, highlight the evolution of a craniofacial pattern exclusively inherent to the admixed groups, indicating that quantitative characters might respond to admixture in a complicated, nondirectional way. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Phenotypic evolution of human craniofacial morphology after admixture: A geometric morphometrics approach","volume":"129","page start":"387","authors with affiliations":"Martínez-Abadías, N., Departament de Biologia Animal, Facultat de Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona 08028, Spain, Unitat d\u0027Antropologia, Facultat de Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Av.

Initial attempts at dating were based on correlation with extinct fauna, the \"geologic-climatic\" dating method, and stratigraphic relationships of artifacts within sites. By the time radiocarbon dating was developed (1950), the basic Paleoindian sequence (oldest to youngest) was: Clovis-Folsom-unfluted lanceolates (such as Plainview, Eden, and Scottsbluff). Initial applications of radiocarbon dating in the 1950s did little to further resolve age relationships. In the 1960s, however, largely through the efforts of C. V. Haynes, a numerical geochronology of Paleoindian occupations on the Great Plains began to emerge On the Southern Great Plains the radiocarbon-dated artifact chronology is: Clovis (11,600-11,000 yr B.P.); Folsom and Midland (10,900-10,100 yr B.P.); Plainview, Milnesand, and Lubbock (10,200-9800 yr B.P.); Firstview (9400-8200 yr B.P.); St. Mary\u0027s Hall, Golondrina, and Texas Angostura (9200-8000 yr B.P.). The chronology for the Northern Great Plains is: Clovis (11,200-10,900 yr B.P.); Goshen (ca. 11,000 yr B.P.); Folsom (10,900-10,200 yr B.P.); Agate Basin (10,500-10,000 yr B.P.); Hell Gap (10,500-9500 yr B.P.); Alberta, Alberta-Cody (10,200-9400 yr B.P.); Cody (Eden-Scottsbluff) (9400-8800 yr B.P.); Angostura, Jimmy Allen, Frederick, and other parallel-oblique types (9400-7800 yr B.P.). Fifty years after the development of radiocarbon dating, the basic typological sequence has not changed significantly except for the realization that there probably was significant temporal overlap of some point types, and that the old unilinear sequence does not account for all the known typological variation.

Studies of these sharp-edged stone tools show that they were most probably used as cutting implements. However, the only substantial evidence of this is the presence of cut marks on the bones of animals found in association with stone tools in ancient deposits. Numerous studies have aimed to quantify the frequency and placement of these marks. At present there is little consensus on the meaning of these marks and how the frequency relates to specific behaviours in the past. Here we investigate the possibility that mechanical properties associated with edges of stone tools as well as the properties of bones themselves may contribute to the overall morphology of these marks and ultimately their placement in the archaeological record. Standardized tests of rock mechanics (Young’s modulus and Vickers hardness) indicate that the hardness of tool edges significantly affects cut-mark morphology. In addition, we show that indentation hardness of bones also impacts the overall morphology of cut marks. Our results show that rock type and bone portions influence the shape and prevalence of cut marks on animal bones. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Using free software and an example dataset from two geographical populations of sessile oak leaves, we describe in detailed but simple terms how to: a) compute size and shape variables using Procrustes methods; b) test measurement error and the main levels of variation (population and trees) using a hierachical design; c) estimate the accuracy of group discrimination; d) repeat this estimate after controlling for the effect of size differences on shape (i.e., allometry). Measurement error was completely negligible; individual variation in leaf morphology was large and differences between trees were generally bigger than within trees; differences between the two geographic populations were small in both size and shape; despite a weak allometric trend, controlling for the effect of size on shape slighly increased discrimination accuracy. Procrustes based methods for the analysis of landmarks were highly efficient in measuring the hierarchical structure of differences in leaves and in revealing very small-scale variation. In taxonomy and many other fields of botany and biology, the application of geometric morphometrics contributes to increase scientific rigour in the description of important aspects of the phenotypic dimension of biodiversity. Easy to follow but detailed step by step example studies can promote a more extensive use of these numerical methods, as they provide an introduction to the discipline which, for many biologists, is less intimidating than the often inaccessible specialistic literature. © 2011 Viscosi, Cardini.","source":"Scopus","title":"Leaf morphology, taxonomy and geometric morphometrics: A simplified protocol for beginners","volume":"6","authors with affiliations":"Viscosi, V., Museo Erbario del Molise, Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie per l\u0027Ambiente e il Territorio, Università del Molise, Contrada Fonte Lappone, Pesche, Italy;

Zooarchaeologists have attempted to study these changes osteologically in their search for the geographic and temporal origins of initial animal domestication during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. Traditional biometric approaches have explored broad changes in body size over time, but this approach provides poor resolution. Here we investigate whether geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of cranial shape can be used to provide better resolution between wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), since shape is less affected by environmental factors than size. GMM combined with traditional multivariate statistics were applied to the crania of 42 modern domestic pigs (representing 6 breeds), 10 wild×domestic first generation hybrid pigs and 55 adult wild boar. Further analyses were carried out on morphologically discrete portions of the crania to simulate the fragmented nature of archaeological mammal remains. We found highly significant discrimination between wild and domestic pigs, both on the whole crania, and subsets including the parietal, the basicranium, the angle of the nasal and the zygomatic. We also demonstrate that it is possible to discriminate different domestic breeds on the basis of cranial morphology, and that 1st generation hybrid wild×domestic pig morphology more closely resembles wild pigs than domestic, suggesting that a wild phenotype (here represented by morphology) is dominant over a recessive domestic one. Our data demonstrate that GMM techniques can provide a quantifiable, clear classification between wild and domestic Sus (even using partial cranial remains) which has significant implications for zooarchaeological research. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","volume":"43","page start":"159","authors with affiliations":"Owen, J., Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, School of Geosciences, St. Mary\u0027s Building, Elphinstone Road, United Kingdom, Human Evolutionary Studies Program, Simon Fraser University, Education Building 9635, 8888 University Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; Dobney, K., Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, School of Geosciences, St. Mary\u0027s Building, Elphinstone Road, United Kingdom; Evin, A., Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, School of Geosciences, St. Mary\u0027s Building, Elphinstone Road, United Kingdom, CNRS-Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, UMR 7209, Archéoozoologie, Histoire des sociétés humaines et de peuplements animaux, 55 rue Buffon, 75005 Paris, France; Cucchi, T., Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, School of Geosciences, St. Mary\u0027s Building, Elphinstone Road, United Kingdom, CNRS-Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, UMR 7209, Archéoozoologie, Histoire des sociétés humaines et de peuplements animaux, 55 rue Buffon, 75005 Paris, France; Larson, G., Durham Evolution and Ancient DNA, Department of Archaeology, University of Durham, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom; Strand Vidarsdottir, U., Department of Anthropology, University of Durham, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"55980924700;6602595568;23977570900;6506822509;8280762100;55349385000;","index keywords":"archaeology; biometry; body size; domestication; Holocene; morphometry; phenotype; pig; three-dimensional modeling; Animalia; Crania; Mammalia; Suidae; Sus; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Classification; Crania; Domestication; Geometric morphometrics; Sus scrofa; Zooarchaeology","authors":"Owen J., Dobney K., Evin A., Cucchi T., Larson G., Strand Vidarsdottir U.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2013.12.010"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Rohlf F.J.","x":1124.5029296875,"y":-2817.276611328125,"id":"8991","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003042557","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","authors with affiliations":"Rohlf, F.J.","Modularity Class":"6","year":"1990","source title":"Proceedings of the Michigan Morphometrics Workshop","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"4.0","title":"Rotational fit (Procrustes) methods","authors":"Rohlf F.J."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"von Cramon-Taubadel N.","x":536.4078369140625,"y":-2824.90087890625,"id":"8708","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84895168539","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"4","year":"2014","page end":"77","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84895168539\u0026doi\u003d10.4436%2fJASS.91010\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dc9a1d3041a37ef8e34e643d374655877","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent, Canterbury, CT2 7NR, United Kingdom","source title":"Journal of Anthropological Sciences","abstract":"The study of cranial variation has a long, and somewhat difficult, history within anthropology. Much of this difficulty is rooted in the historical use of craniometric data to justify essentialist typological racial classification schemes. In the post-war era of the \u0027New Physical Anthropology\u0027 (sensu Washburn, 1951), anthropologists began to analyse human variation in an explicitly populationist and evolutionary philosophical and analytical framework. However, even within recent decades, substantially different approaches have been employed; some advocate a focus on the analysis of individual traits or clines, while others are explicitly adaptationist, with a focus on natural selection as the preeminent force of phenotypic diversification. In recent years, a series of studies have analysed craniometric data in an explicitly quantitative genetic framework, which emphasises the importance of neutral forces such as migration, gene flow and genetic drift in creating global patterns of phenotypic diversity. This approach has revealed that global patterns of cranial variation can largely be explained on the basis of neutral theory. Therefore, human cranial data can be productively employed as a proxy for neutral genetic data in archaeological contexts. Moreover, there is a growing recognition that regions of the cranium differ in the extent to which they fit a neutral model of microevolutionary expectation, allowing for a more detailed assessment of patterns of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity within the human skull. Taking an historical perspective, the current state of knowledge regarding patterns of cranial adaptation in response to climatic and dietary effects is reviewed. Further insights will be gained by better incorporating the study of cranial and postcranial variation, as well as understanding the impact of neutral versus non-neutral evolution in creating amongspecies diversity patterns in primates more generally. However, this will most effectively be achieved when comparative anatomy studies are situated within an explicitly quantitative genetic evolutionary framework.","source":"Scopus","title":"Evolutionary insights into global patterns of human cranial diversity: Population history, climatic and dietary effects","volume":"92","page start":"43","authors with affiliations":"von Cramon-Taubadel, N., Department of Anthropology, School of Anthropology and Conservation, University of Kent, Canterbury, CT2 7NR, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"23471109300;","index keywords":"adaptation; anatomy and histology; cephalometry; climate; evolution; feeding behavior; human; phenotype; physical anthropology; physiology; population genetics; skull; Adaptation, Physiological; Anthropology, Physical; Biological Evolution; Cephalometry; Climate; Food Habits; Genetics, Population; Humans; Phenotype; Skull","document type":"Review","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Adaptation; Cranial variation; Microevolution; Population history; Quantitative genetics","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"von Cramon-Taubadel N.","doi":"10.4436/JASS.91010"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Elewa A.M.T.","x":1106.9876708984375,"y":454.09619140625,"id":"9255","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79955381930","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","authors with affiliations":"Elewa, A.M.T.","Modularity Class":"6","year":"2010","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Morphometrics for Nonmorphometricians","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"4.0","title":"Morphometrics for Nonmorphometricians.

In mammals, teeth are well preserved in archaeological remains and are known to be taxonomically informative. In this study, we compare three sets of dental morphometric descriptors in wild and domestic pigs (Sus scrofa) - maximum length, size and shape variables from 2D geometric morphometrics - in order to assess which of the three provides the best ability to correctly distinguish current wild and domestic West Palaearctic pigs. For this purpose, we used predictive linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation taking into account potential bias due to heterogeneous sample sizes and important number of predictors. Classification accuracy of wild and domestic status ranged between 77.3 and 93% depending of the tooth and the descriptor analyzed. However, individual posterior probabilities of correct classification were appreciably smaller when using tooth length and centroid size compared to shape variables. Size appeared to be a poor indicator of wild and domestic status, contrary to shape which in addition provides a high degree of confidence in the wild versus domestic predictions.

Some workers consider this fossil human group to represent a different species. Homo neanderthalensis, while others see it as a subspecies of Homo sapiens. This study developed two models of morphological variation to be applied to a comparison between Neanderthals and modern humans: modern human populations provided a measure of intra-specific variation, while the species and subspecies of Pan provided measures of both intra- and inter-specific morphological differences. Although such an approach has been advocated strongly, it has not been systematically undertaken until recently. The techniques of geometric morphometrics were used to collect data in the form of three-dimensional coordinates of craniofacial landmarks. The data were processed using generalized procrustes analysis, and analyzed by an array of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components analysis, canonical variates analysis and Mahalanobis D2. The morphological distances between Neanderthals and modern humans, and between Neanderthals and Late Paleolithic/early anatomically modern specimens, are consistently greater than the distances among recent human populations, and greater than the distances between the two chimpanzee species. Furthermore, no strong morphological similarities were found between Neanderthals and Late Paleolithic Europeans.

The majority of these points were collected from the pampas region of Argentina, Uruguay, central Chile, and southern Patagonia. These artifacts are defined by a convex blade, rounded shoulders, slightly concave stem sides, concave base, and occasional fluting on one or both faces. The presence of fluting and the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene chronological assignment have been proposed as evidence in support of a cultural relationship between these points and the early points of North America. To explore projectile point shape and related size variation in a quantitative way, we applied geometric morphometric techniques over a sample of 24 Fishtail points from Uruguay. The major trends of shape variation were tested against metric attributes, geographical provenance, and lithic raw material type. Results suggest no relationships between geographical provenance or lithic raw material type and shape variation. However, a significant correlation between size and shape was observed, which indicates an allometric relationship. Finally, we discuss some implications of these results in terms of the design and life history of projectile points and their relationship with the hunter-gatherer technology of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene.

Controversy has arisen over which method is the \"best\" for quantifying the morphological difference between forms and for making proper statistical statements about the detected differences. This paper explains that many of these arguments are superfluous to the real issues that need to be understood by those wishing to apply morphometric methods to biological data. Validity, the ability of a method to find the correct answer, is rarely discussed and often ignored. We explain why demonstration of validity is a necessary step in the evaluation of methods used in morphometrics. Focusing specifically on landmark data, we discuss the concepts of size and shape, and reiterate that since no unique definition of size exists, shape can only be recognized with reference to a chosen surrogate for size. We explain why only a limited class of information related to the morphology of an object can be known when landmark data are used. This observation has genuine consequences, as certain morphometric methods are based on models that require specific assumptions, some of which exceed what can be known from landmark data. We show that orientation of an object with reference to other objects in a sample can never be known, because this information is not included in landmark data. Consequently, a descriptor of form difference that contains information on orientation is flawed because that information does not arise from evidence within the data, but instead is a product of a chosen orientation scheme. To illustrate these points, we apply superimposition, deformation, and linear distance-based morphometric methods to the analysis of a simulated data set for which the true differences are known. This analysis demonstrates the relative efficacy of various methods to reveal the true difference between forms. Our discussion is intended to be fair, but it will be obvious to the reader that we favor a particular approach. Our bias comes from the realization that morphometric methods should operate with a definition of form and form difference consistent with the limited class of information that can be known from landmark data. Answers based on information that can be known from the data are of more use to biological inquiry than those based on unjustifiable assumptions.

We suggest how developmental and functional criteria can be used to predict where in the skeleton of fossil hominins we should expect more, or less, within-species variation. We present and test three hypotheses about the factors contributing to craniodental variation in extant primate taxa, and then apply these results to the interpretation of the P. boisei hypodigm. Within the comparative samples of extant Homo, Pan, Gorilla, Pongo, and Colobus, variables from the cranial base, neurocranium, and face that are not subject to high magnitudes of strain have consistently lower levels of intraspecific variation than variables from regions of the face subject to high levels of strain. Dental size variables are intermediate in terms of their reliability. P. boisei is found to have a low degree of variability relative to extant primates for variables shown to be generally useful for testing taxonomic hypotheses. Contrary to the claims of Suwa et al. ([1997] Nature 389:489-492), the recently discovered material from Konso falls within the range of variation of the \"pre-Konso\" hypodigm of P. boisei for available conventional metrical variables. Those aspects of the Konso material that appear to extend the range of the P. boisei hypodigm involve regions of the skull predicted to be prone to high levels of within-species variation.

The results from the experimental study show that there is a good fit between raw material type and cut mark morphology, enabling us to confidently apply this method to the analysis of the cut marks of the BK fossil assemblage.

Here we report a three-part study in which we investigated the transition using radiocarbon dates from Clovis and Folsom sites. In the first part of the study, we used dates from Folsom site-phases to determine when and where Folsom originated. In the second part of the study, we employed Clovis and Folsom dates in analyses designed to determine whether Folsom spread via demic diffusion or cultural diffusion. In the third part of the study we investigated the velocity of the Clovis-Folsom transition. The analyses suggest that Folsom first appeared around 12,800 calBP in the northern High Plains and spread north and south from there. They also suggest that the spread of Folsom was, at least in part, the result of population expansion. In addition, the analyses indicate that the spread of Folsom was relatively fast for a prehistoric diffusion but well below the maximum velocity that has been estimated for such events. These findings, in turn, have implications for the hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the Clovis-Folsom transition. They refute the idea that the Clovis-Folsom transition resulted from an extraterrestrial impact over northern North America at 12,900 ± 100 calBP but are consistent with the alternative proposal that the transition was a response to climate-driven environmental change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Spatiotemporal dynamics of the Clovis-Folsom transition","volume":"37","page start":"2513","authors with affiliations":"Collard, M., Laboratory of Human Evolutionary Studies, Department of Archaeology, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada, Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, United States; Buchanan, B., Laboratory of Human Evolutionary Studies, Department of Archaeology, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada, Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, United States; Hamilton, M.J., Department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, United States, Department of Biology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, United States, Santa Fe Institute, Santa Fe, United States; O\u0027Brien, M.J., Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, United States","author(s) id":"7102608373;11241802300;8578778600;36128081000;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; cultural history; cultural tradition; environmental change; human settlement; Paleolithic; radiocarbon dating; spatiotemporal analysis; Great Plains","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Clovis; Demic diffusion; Folsom; Paleoindian; Radiocarbon dates","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Collard M., Buchanan B., Hamilton M.J., O\u0027Brien M.J.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2010.05.011"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"James Rohlf F., Marcus L.F.","x":-1065.8370361328125,"y":-1215.931640625,"id":"8740","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0242462501","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.03711340206185567","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"4","year":"1993","page end":"132","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0242462501\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2f0169-5347%2893%2990024-J\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d14afd83efbc93ae5f62d49a4829a5597","affiliations":"Dept of Ecology and Evolution, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5245, United States; Dept of Biology, Queen\u0027s College, CUNY, Flushing, NY 11367, United States","source title":"Trends in Ecology and Evolution","abstract":"We are now in the midst of a revolution in morphometric methodology.

We based this appreciation upon the detailed morphology of the distal part of the metapodials. Landmark approaches were applied to archaeological and palaeontological samples from three distinct areas: Switzerland Plateau, Paris Basin, and Charente (France). Little differences of isometric size characterized the three regional samples. Multivariate analyses of shape (principal component analysis, discriminant, canonical variates and neural network analyses) revealed similar sets of complex shape features on both metacarpals and metatarsals. In addition, regional groups appeared clearly differentiated by well defined shape patterns, the functional implications of which remain to be established. These results evidence the existence of a regional structuration of populations (particularly clear on the CVA of both metacarpals and metatarsals) suggesting the absence of long distance migrations. Finally, it appears that the distinction between size and shape systematically operated by geometric morphometrics can provide better insights into the study of the mobility of ancient populations.

It probably originated in Africa, spreading to Europe and Asia perhaps as early as ∼1million years (Myr) ago. The origin of the Acheulian is thought to have closely coincided with major changes in human brain evolution, allowing for further technological developments. Nonetheless, the emergence of the Acheulian remains unclear because well-dated sites older than 1.4Myr ago are scarce. Here we report on the lithic assemblage and geological context for the Kokiselei 4 archaeological site from the Nachukui formation (West Turkana, Kenya) that bears characteristic early Acheulian tools and pushes the first appearance datum for this stone-age technology back to 1.76Myr ago. Moreover, co-occurrence of Oldowan and Acheulian artefacts at the Kokiselei site complex indicates that the two technologies are not mutually exclusive time-successive components of an evolving cultural lineage, and suggests that the Acheulian was either imported from another location yet to be identified or originated from Oldowan hominins at this vicinity. In either case, the Acheulian did not accompany the first human dispersal from Africa despite being available at the time. This may indicate that multiple groups of hominins distinguished by separate stone-tool-making behaviours and dispersal strategies coexisted in Africa at 1.76Myr ago. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here, we test this hypothesis quantitatively with matrix correlation statistics. Using a sample of Early Paleoindian point assemblages from across the continent we attempt to correlate variation in point shape with several measures of late Pleistocene period regional variation including net primary production, prey availability, prey selection, and prey body size. We find no significant correlations between point shape and measures of regional variation, suggesting that functional modifications to points within specific regional biomes were minimal. We do find evidence of spatial autocorrelation as the regional variation in point shape correlates positively with geographic distances among sites, a pattern consistent with recent, shared ancestry. Our findings provide support for the drift hypothesis posed by Morrow and Morrow (1999). We interpret these results as suggesting that despite the wide variation in regional environmental conditions across late Pleistocene period North America not enough time elapsed during the Early Paleoindian period for these local selective gradients to have led to significant changes in point shape. Recientemente se ha sugerido que las variaciones encontradas en las puntas de proyectiles a lo largo de Norteamerica durante la etapa temprana del periodo Paleoindio file el resultado de deriva, en lugar de la adaptacion regional (Morrow y Morrow 1999).

Tests for allometry and asymmetry were not significant. The test of morphological disparity indicates that Gahagan bifaces produced at the Mounds Plantation site occupy a more restricted range of morphospace than those produced at Gahagan Mound, providing indirect evidence for standardisation and diversity in Caddo biface production. While the sample includes a wide range of variation in biface shapes, the test of morphological integration indicates that Gahagan bifaces are significantly integrated, meaning that those traits used to characterise their shape (blade and base) vary in a coordinated manner.

Related to this problem is the absence of a robust statistical technique for comparing variation between different kinds of assemblages. This paper addresses these issues. The Weber fraction for line-length estimation describes the minimum difference that humans can perceive through unaided visual inspection. This value is used to derive a constant for the coefficient of variation (CV \u003d 1.7 percent) that represents the highest degree of standardization attainable through manual human production of artifacts. Random data are used to define a second constant for the coefficient of variation that represents variation expected when production is random (CV \u003d 57.7 percent). These two constants can be used to assess the degree of standardization in artifact assemblages regardless of kind. Our analysis further demonstrates that CV is an excellent measure of standardization and provides a robust statistical technique for comparing standardization in samples of artifacts.

A. Mead discovered a spear in association with an elephant skeleton near Miami in Roberts County, Texas. During 1937 this locality was excavated. The elephant bones were found in an old, now completely filled, sink which had been a water-hole. The lower part of the fill in the sink contained no recognizable fossils, but at a level 1 or 1% feet below the present surface was a bone layer extending entirely across the sink. Above this level, no additional bones were found. No bones other than elephant were present. The conditions of occurrence indicate that several elephants are present, ranging in age from very young to mature. In the bone bed were found one scraper and three spears. One of the spears lay about 3 inches from, and at the same level as, the first cervical vertebra of an elephant. Another spear and the scraper were near elephant bones. The artifacts are of the Folsom or Folsom-like culture type. Whether the elephants were trapped or bogged at this water-hole or suffered from drought or illness is unknown. The sink in which the fossils are found is much older than the modern sinks of this region, as shown by the fact that it had become completely filled. The age of the deposits is not fully determined.

With the simultaneous use of five characters of the hip bone, it is possible to provide a correct sexual diagnosis in 95% of all cases, with an error of 2% and an inability to identify sex in only 3%.

In addition, this method of sex determination increases the probability of a correct diagnosis with isolated fragments of the hip bone, provided that a combination of elements of one character is found to be typically male or female. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"A method for visual determination of sex, using the human hip bone","volume":"117","page start":"157","authors with affiliations":"Bruzek, J., U.M.R. 5809 du C.N.R.S., Laboratoire d\u0027Anthropologie des Populations du Passé, Université Bordeaux I, 33405 Talence, France, Laboratoire d\u0027Anthropologie des Populations du Passé, UMR 5809 du CNRS, Université Bordeaux I, Avenue des Facultés, 33405 Talence, France","author(s) id":"6602595244;","index keywords":"article; controlled study; error; female; hip; human; male; methodology; sex determination; visual system","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Human pelvis; Method; Morphological traits; Sex determination","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Bruzek J.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.10012"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Bordes F.","x":4990.3974609375,"y":-366.14324951171875,"id":"8759","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003911253","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","authors with affiliations":"Bordes, F.","Modularity Class":"5","year":"1961","source title":"Typologie du Paléolithique Ancien et Moyen","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"3.0","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Bordes F."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Corny J., Galland M., Arzarello M., Bacon A.-M., Demeter F., Grimaud-Hervé D., Higham C., Matsumura H., Nguyen L.C., Nguyen T.K.T., Nguyen V., Oxenham M., Sayavongkhamdy T., Sémah F., Shackelford L.L., Détroit F.","x":689.8980712890625,"y":-2340.263671875,"id":"3852","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85032992386","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"4","year":"2017","page end":"56","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85032992386\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jhevol.2017.08.017\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d32657401d3c99aa0df4cac4d3d08bc97","affiliations":"Aix Marseille Université, CNRS, EFS, ADES UMR 7268, Marseille, 13916, France; University College Dublin, School of Archaeology, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland; Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Musée de l\u0027Homme, Département Homme et environnement, CNRS, UMR 7206, Paris, 75116, France; Università degli Studi di Ferrara, Dipartimento Studi Umanistici, Ferrara, 44121, Italy; Université Paris-Descartes, Faculté de chirurgie dentaire, UMR 5288 CNRS, AMIS, Montrouge, 92120, France; Center for GeoGenetics, Copenhagen, Denmark; Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Musée de l\u0027Homme, Département Homme et environnement, CNRS, UMR 7194, Paris, 75116, France; University of Otago, Department of Anthropology and Archaeology, Dunedin, 9054, New Zealand; Sapporo Medical University, School of Health Science, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan; Institute of Archaeology, Hanoi, Viet Nam; Center for Southeast Asian Prehistory, 96/203 Hoang Quoc Viet, Hanoi, Viet Nam; Australian National University, School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Canberra, ACT  0200, Australia; Department of National Heritage, Ministry of Information and Culture, Vientiane, United Kingdom; University of Illinois, Department of Anthropology, Urbana, IL  61801, United States","source title":"Journal of Human Evolution","abstract":"The population history of anatomically modern humans (AMH) in Southeast Asia (SEA) is a highly debated topic. The impact of sea level variations related to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Neolithic diffusion on past population dispersals are two key issues. We have investigated competing AMH dispersal hypotheses in SEA through the analysis of dental phenotype shape variation on the basis of very large archaeological samples employing two complementary approaches. We first explored the structure of between- and within-group shape variation of permanent human molar crowns. Second, we undertook a direct test of competing hypotheses through a modeling approach. Our results identify a significant LGM-mediated AMH expansion and a strong biological impact of the spread of Neolithic farmers into SEA during the Holocene. The present work thus favors a “multiple AMH dispersal” hypothesis for the population history of SEA, reconciling phenotypic and recent genomic data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"Dental phenotypic shape variation supports a multiple dispersal model for anatomically modern humans in Southeast Asia","volume":"112","page start":"41","authors with affiliations":"Corny, J., Aix Marseille Université, CNRS, EFS, ADES UMR 7268, Marseille, 13916, France; Galland, M., University College Dublin, School of Archaeology, Belfield, Dublin, Ireland, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Musée de l\u0027Homme, Département Homme et environnement, CNRS, UMR 7206, Paris, 75116, France; Arzarello, M., Università degli Studi di Ferrara, Dipartimento Studi Umanistici, Ferrara, 44121, Italy; Bacon, A.-M., Université Paris-Descartes, Faculté de chirurgie dentaire, UMR 5288 CNRS, AMIS, Montrouge, 92120, France; Demeter, F., Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Musée de l\u0027Homme, Département Homme et environnement, CNRS, UMR 7206, Paris, 75116, France, Center for GeoGenetics, Copenhagen, Denmark; Grimaud-Hervé, D., Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Musée de l\u0027Homme, Département Homme et environnement, CNRS, UMR 7194, Paris, 75116, France; Higham, C., University of Otago, Department of Anthropology and Archaeology, Dunedin, 9054, New Zealand; Matsumura, H., Sapporo Medical University, School of Health Science, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan; Nguyen, L.C., Institute of Archaeology, Hanoi, Viet Nam; Nguyen, T.K.T., Institute of Archaeology, Hanoi, Viet Nam; Nguyen, V., Center for Southeast Asian Prehistory, 96/203 Hoang Quoc Viet, Hanoi, Viet Nam; Oxenham, M., Australian National University, School of Archaeology and Anthropology, Canberra, ACT  0200, Australia; Sayavongkhamdy, T., Department of National Heritage, Ministry of Information and Culture, Vientiane, United Kingdom; Sémah, F., Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Musée de l\u0027Homme, Département Homme et environnement, CNRS, UMR 7194, Paris, 75116, France; Shackelford, L.L., University of Illinois, Department of Anthropology, Urbana, IL  61801, United States; Détroit, F., Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Musée de l\u0027Homme, Département Homme et environnement, CNRS, UMR 7194, Paris, 75116, France","author(s) id":"55928735500;56919438200;15822094900;7005967102;8519621800;56168771500;7003507065;8519622500;7202156601;57209165953;55960997400;8264446500;24339512600;7003586205;6701493845;6504774261;","index keywords":"anatomy; archaeology; dentition; genomics; Last Glacial Maximum; morphometry; Neolithic; phenotype; population characteristics; Southeast Asia; Homo sapiens; anatomy and histology; biological variation; human; mandible; migration; molar tooth; physical anthropology; population dynamics; Southeast Asia; Anthropology, Physical; Asia, Southeastern; Biological Variation, Population; Human Migration; Humans; Mandible; Molar; Population Dynamics","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Contour analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Homo sapiens; Last Glacial Maximum; Neolithic expansion; Population history","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Corny J., Galland M., Arzarello M., Bacon A.-M., Demeter F., Grimaud-Hervé D., Higham C., Matsumura H., Nguyen L.C., Nguyen T.K.T., Nguyen V., Oxenham M., Sayavongkhamdy T., Sémah F., Shackelford L.L., Détroit F.","doi":"10.1016/j.jhevol.2017.08.017"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Bookstein F.L.","x":-362.32025146484375,"y":1427.3623046875,"id":"8952","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84972512610","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"2","year":"1986","page end":"222","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84972512610\u0026doi\u003d10.1214%2fss%2f1177013696\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d98c2176a274e08130b8f03506a13c0a4","affiliations":"Center for Human Growth and Development, Consortium for Research in Developmental and Reproductive Biology, Department of Biostatistics of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Statistical Science","abstract":"Biometrie studies of the forms of organisms usually consider size and shape variations in the geometric configuration of landmarks, points that correspond biologically from form to form. The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle ΔABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0, 0) and landmark B to (1, 0). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S, which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling’s T2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions at an angle averaging 90° in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth.

We found that the phylogenetic hypotheses based on the craniodental data were incompatible with the molecular phylogenies for the groups. Given the robustness of the molecular phylogenies, these results indicate that little confidence can be placed in phylogenies generated solely from higher primate craniodental evidence.

The basin, 23 m diameter × 1.6 m deep, filled with (1) dark gray silty clay, and (2) near the top of the section, a lens of well-sorted silt or loess. The basin started to fill ca. 13,700 yr B.P., the loess dates to ca. 11,400 yr B.P., and the bone bed probably dates to ca. 11,400-10,500 yr B.P.

The bone is heavily weathered and there are no clear indications of human modification.

In turn, this has led to suggestions that the temporal bone is particularly reliable in analyses of primate phylogeny and human population history. While several reasons have been suggested to explain the temporal bone\u0027s strong fit with neutral expectation, the temporal bone has never systematically been compared against other individual cranial bones defined using the same biological criteria. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the shapes of all cranial bones possess reliable information regarding neutral genetic evolution, or whether the temporal bone is unique in this respect. This study tests the hypothesis that the human temporal bone is more congruent with neutral expectation than six other individual cranial bones by correlating population affinity matrices generated using neutral genetic and 3D craniometric data. The results demonstrate that while the temporal bone shows the absolute strongest correlation with neutral genetic data compared with all other bones, it is not statistically differentiated from the sphenoid, frontal, and parietal bones in this regard. Potential reasons for the temporal bone\u0027s consistently strong fit with neutral expectation, such as its overall anatomical complexity and/or its contribution to the architecture of the basicranium, are examined.

The sample included 73 H. neanderthalensis, 67 contemporary H. sapiens, 5 A. africanus, and 24 Pan lower molars. Results indicate general agreement in the morphology observed on the dentine and enamel surfaces. All but one H. neanderthalensis molar shows some trigonid crest development, whereas trigonid crests occur in low frequency in contemporary humans. Pan and A. africanus both also show high frequencies of a continuous trigonid crest. However, the origin of the trigonid crest differs among groups.

Genetic drift may explain the high frequency of trigonid crests in H.neanderthalensis. However, H. neanderthalensis still appears to be derived relative to Pan and A. africanus in its high frequency of the mesial-mesial trigonid crest configuration.

Here, the relationship between global mandibular shape variation and subsistence economy is tested, while controlling for the potentially confounding effects of shared population history, geography, and climate. The results demonstrate that the mandible, in contrast to the cranium, significantly reflects subsistence strategy rather than neutral genetic patterns, with hunter-gatherers having consistently longer and narrower mandibles than agriculturalists. These results support notions that a decrease in masticatory stress among agriculturalists causes the mandible to grow and develop differently. This developmental argument also explains why there is often a mismatch between the size of the lower face and the dentition, which, in turn, leads to increased prevalence of dental crowding and malocclusions in modern postindustrial populations.

While there is considerable comparative evidence to support this idea, most experimental tests of this hypothesis have been on non-human primates or other very prognathic mammals (rodents, swine) raised on hard versus very soft (nearly liquid) diets. Here, we examine facial growth and in vivo strains generated in response to raw/dried foods versus cooked foods in a retrognathic mammal, the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis). The results indicate that the hyrax cranium resembles the non-human primate cranium in having a steep gradient of strains from the occlusal to orbital regions, but differs from most non-anthropoids in being primarily twisted; the hyrax mandible is bent both vertically and laterally. In general, higher strains, as much as two-fold at some sites, are generated by masticating raw versus cooked food. Hyraxes raised on cooked food had significantly less growth (approximately 10%) in the ventral (inferior) and posterior portions of the face, where strains are highest, resembling many of the differences evident between humans raised on highly processed versus less processed diets.

Along with its influence on warfare, the horse transformed land transportation, radically altering the distance that humans could travel in a day, week, month or lifetime. Over the last century horse domestication has been investigated by zooarchaeologists using morphometric, morphological and (more recently) biomolecular approaches in attempts to identify distinct \u0027domestic\u0027 phenotypes in the fossil record. However, identification of domestic morphotypes have been complicated by the low variation in equid cranial morphology and apparent limited changes brought about through the domestication process compared with other domestic taxa. Furthermore, cranial morphology is too prone to ecophenotypic plasticity to provide relevant taxonomic markers. Even dental morphology (of primary importance for taxonomic investigation in the fossil record) has been dismissed as a useful marker for horse domestication, since variations in tooth size and enamel patterns are considered to be too greatly influenced by age and continuous tooth wear. The proof-of-concept study presented here re-evaluates the potential of cheek teeth shape to capture significant differences between horse populations. Using geometric morphometrics (GMM), we study the enamel-folding pattern of the upper P2 and M3, selected for their distinctive morphology amongst the cheek teeth. Curated specimens of known age and sex from two horse (Equus caballus) breeds - Icelandic and Thoroughbred - were used to investigate whether the effects of age (through occlusal wear), sexual dimorphism and allometry (size-related change in shape) should be regarded as confounding factors preventing any accurate discrimination between these two populations. The results show that a landmark based approach applied to the occlusal enamel folding of the P2 and M3 captures significant differences in size (centroïd) and shape between the horses breeds studied. Age-related factors, allometric scaling and sexual dimorphism are not confounding factors in their discrimination, encouraging the use of dental form in population-based research on ancient horse remains. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"A geometric morphometric re-evaluation of the use of dental form to explore differences in horse (Equus caballus) populations and its potential zooarchaeological application","volume":"41","page start":"904","authors with affiliations":"Seetah, K., Department of Anthropology, Stanford University, Main Quad, Building 50, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 943205-2034, United States, McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3ER, United Kingdom; Cucchi, T., CNRS, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Département Ecologie et Gestion de la Biodiversité, UMR 7209, Archéozoologie, Archéobotanique: Sociétés, Pratiques et, Environnements, case postale (bâtiment d\u0027anatomie comparée), F-75231 Paris cedex 05, France, Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, St Mary\u0027s Building, Elphinstone Road, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland, United Kingdom; Dobney, K., Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, St Mary\u0027s Building, Elphinstone Road, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, Scotland, United Kingdom; Barker, G., McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3ER, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"23971935000;6506822509;6602595568;7202030377;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; archaeology; domestication; horse; morphometry; morphotype; paleontology; phenotype; sexual dimorphism; tooth; cranium; fossil record; geometry; Animalia; Equidae; Equus caballus","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Age effect; Equus caballus; Population discrimination; Sexual dimorphism; Teeth; Zooarchaeology","pr_indegree":"1.0","authors":"Seetah K., Cucchi T., Dobney K., Barker G.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2013.10.022"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":9.880000114440918},{"label":"Eren M.I., Roos C.I., Story B.A., von Cramon-Taubadel N., Lycett S.J.","x":4562.259765625,"y":2010.656494140625,"id":"8535","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84903479054","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","Modularity Class":"5","issue":"1","year":"2014","page end":"487","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84903479054\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2014.05.034\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d58655aa09ab985e7b4a5c72ca66faef1","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, United States; Department of Archaeology, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Cleveland, OH 44106-1767, United States; Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275, United States; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275, United States; Department of Anthropology, University at Buffalo SUNY, 380 MFAC-Ellicott Complex, Buffalo, NY 14261-0005, United States","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Lithic raw material differences are widely assumed to be a major determining factor of differences in stone tool morphology seen across archaeological sites, but the security of this assumption remains largely untested. Two different sets of raw material properties are thought to influence artifact form. The first set is internal, and related to mechanical flaking properties. The second set is external, namely the form (size, shape, presence of cortex) of the initial nodule or blank from which flakes are struck. We conducted a replication experiment designed to determine whether handaxe morphology was influenced by raw materials of demonstrably different internal and external properties: flint, basalt, and obsidian. The knapper was instructed to copy a \"target\" model handaxe, produced by a different knapper, 35 times in each toolstone type (n\u003d105 handaxes). On each experimental handaxe, 29 size-adjusted (scale-free) morphometric variables were recorded to capture the overall shape of each handaxe in order to compare them statistically to the model. Both Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) were used to determine if raw material properties were a primary determinate of patterns of overall shape differences across the toolstone groups. The PCA results demonstrated that variation in all three toolstones was distributed evenly around the model target form. The MANOVA of all 29 size-adjusted variables, using two different tests, showed no statistically significant differences in overall shape patterns between the three groups of raw material. In sum, our results show that assuming the primacy of raw material differences as the predominant explanatory factor in stone tool morphology, or variation between assemblages, is unwarranted. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"The role of raw material differences in stone tool shape variation: An experimental assessment","volume":"49","page start":"472","authors with affiliations":"Eren, M.I., Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, 65211, United States, Department of Archaeology, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Cleveland, OH 44106-1767, United States; Roos, C.I., Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275, United States; Story, B.A., Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275, United States; von Cramon-Taubadel, N., Department of Anthropology, University at Buffalo SUNY, 380 MFAC-Ellicott Complex, Buffalo, NY 14261-0005, United States; Lycett, S.J., Department of Anthropology, University at Buffalo SUNY, 380 MFAC-Ellicott Complex, Buffalo, NY 14261-0005, United States","author(s) id":"23975681200;43061437300;35766942100;23471109300;9434693200;","index keywords":"Acheulean; archaeological evidence; archaeology; artifact; experimental study; lithic fragment; tool use","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Acheulean; Experiment; Experimental archaeology; Handaxes; Raw material","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Eren M.I., Roos C.I., Story B.A., von Cramon-Taubadel N., Lycett S.J.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2014.05.034"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Blasco R., Rosell J., Fernández Peris J., Cáceres I., Vergès J.M.","x":-5332.13232421875,"y":-1428.773681640625,"id":"8903","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-42149160313","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"6","year":"2008","page end":"1618","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-42149160313\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2007.11.007\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003df36fad2f0ed28a88fd7ce31df1d1aa49","affiliations":"IPHES (Institut Català de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolució Social), Área de Prehistoria, Universtat Rovira i Virgili, Pça Imperial Tarraco, 1, 43005 Tarragona, Spain; SIP (Servei de Investigació Prehistòrica), Museo de Prehistoria, Diputacion de Valencia, C/Corona, 36, 46003 Valencia, Spain","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"In Level XII of Bolomor Cave (Valencia, Spain) modifications have been observed on some of the bone fragments that make up the faunal record.

The frequency at which these modifications appear in the assemblage has obliged to plan several experimental series to know the process that causes them. To be more exact, this study aims to verify whether these small chips are the result of trampling. For this purpose, two experimental series have been developed. The first of which has the objective of differentiating between the variables related to the original state of the bone (green, semi-dry and dry) and the second is aimed at reproducing the modifications observed in the archaeological set, taking into account the data obtained in the previous series. Following these experiments, the appearance of small notches is observed on the oblique fracture angles of some bones in semi-dry state. These resulting chips are similar to those documented in Bolomor Cave, Level XII. Therefore, it is deduced that trampling is the principle cause of these modifications in the bone record.

Similarities in form between Victoria West cores, in terms of surface morphology and the removal of large flakes from a prepared surface, led to hypothesized schemes of technological evolution from Victoria West cores through to fully developed Levallois cores. However, the phylogenetic basis of this Victoria West \"proto-Levallois\" hypothesis, and the assumptions of phylogenetic homology upon which it rests, have never been tested formally. In recent years, archaeologists have begun to use phylogenetic methods drawn from biology to test hypotheses of technological and cultural evolution. Here, the phylogenetic assumptions of the Victoria West \"proto-Levallois\" hypothesis are tested directly using a cladistic (maximum parsimony) protocol. The cladistic analyses indicate that Victoria West cores are not the basal sister taxon of a Levallois clade, as predicted by the proto-Levallois hypothesis. Moreover, character analyses demonstrate that several characters relating to core surfaces and flake scar morphology are not phylogenetically homologous, but result from convergent technological evolution within the Acheulean techno-complex. Post hoc analyses further determine that these results are not confounded by choice of outgroup or raw material factors. The results were also shown to be robust on the basis of the ensemble retention index statistic, bootstrap analyses, and permutation tests. Hence, it is concluded that Victoria West cores do not represent a \"proto-Levallois\" core form, and that the term \"para-Levallois\" should more correctly be applied on phylogenetic grounds. It is further argued that even in cases where different technologies are found to share phylogenetically homologous features, use of the term \"proto\" is questionable on theoretical grounds. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Latin authors described donkeys as being particularly suitable for the transport of goods and farm work. In addition, they were also bred to produce prized hybrids, particularly mules, which were perfectly adapted to the long-distance transport of people and goods. However, although the historical sources extensively describe their economic importance, both donkey and hybrid remains are surprisingly scarce in the archaeological record. This apparent contradiction is probably due to the difficulties involved in correctly identifying their bones: relatively few bones displaying morphological and metrical criteria can be used for identification, so it is often based purely on bone size. The aim of this study, therefore, is to propose solutions to identify domestic equid bones using 3D geometric morphometrics on isolated and combinations of anatomical elements. A set of 3D coordinates were registered on the 18 main skull and limb bones of 111 modern reference specimens (i.e. 42 horses, 44 donkeys and 25 hybrids). In this paper, we present the classification rate obtained on this reference sample using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The application of this method on archaeological skeletons from Roman to modern sites is also presented. The percentage of correctly classified specimens was between 77% and 95% for all 18 bones, and higher than 80% for 10 of the fragmentation patterns we defined. Using a combination of several bones enabled us to increase the rate of correct reclassification to a maximum of 97%. The application to archaeological skeletons proved the ability of this method to identify domestic horses and donkeys from archaeological samples. Correspondingly, some bones, and especially combinations of bones, provided good rates to identify hybrids. This method has proved reliable in detecting the presence of donkeys and hybrids from the archaeological samples of equid bones, and should enrich our knowledge regarding their spread across Europe. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"Identifying domestic horses, donkeys and hybrids from archaeological deposits: A 3D morphological investigation on skeletons","volume":"78","page start":"88","authors with affiliations":"Hanot, P., Laboratoire Archéozoologie et Archéobotanique: Sociétés, Pratiques et Environnements, UMR 7209, CNRS, MNHN, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités, 55 rue Buffon CP 56, Paris, France; Guintard, C., École Nationale Vétérinaire, de l\u0027Agroalimentaire et de l\u0027Alimentation, Nantes Atlantique – ONIRIS, route de Gachet, CS 40706, Nantes, 44307, France; Lepetz, S., Laboratoire Archéozoologie et Archéobotanique: Sociétés, Pratiques et Environnements, UMR 7209, CNRS, MNHN, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités, 55 rue Buffon CP 56, Paris, France; Cornette, R., Institut de Systématique Évolution Biodiversité, ISYEB, UMR 7205, CNRS, MNHN, UPMC, EPHE, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Sorbonne Universités, 45 rue Buffon, Paris, France","author(s) id":"56303948700;6602112945;26036377000;6506350460;","index keywords":"algorithm; archaeological evidence; archaeology; domestication; horse; morphometry; skeleton; three-dimensional modeling; Equidae; Equus; Equus asinus; Equus caballus","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"3D geometric morphometrics; Equus; Species identification; Zooarchaeology","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Hanot P., Guintard C., Lepetz S., Cornette R.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2016.12.002"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Buchanan B., Eren M.I., Boulanger M.T., O\u0027Brien M.J.","x":768.9905395507812,"y":2642.495849609375,"id":"9052","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84929612436","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.01443298969072165","Modularity Class":"6","year":"2015","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84929612436\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jasrep.2015.05.011\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d36eca1afe8992978d844e441c58b3016","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK  74104, United States; Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO  65211, United States; Department of Archaeology, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Cleveland, OH  44106, United States; Archaeometry Laboratory, University of Missouri Research Reactor, Columbia, MO  65211, United States","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","abstract":"Resharpening is considered to be a common technique for extending the use life of stone tools in certain prehistoric contexts. For Clovis peoples, the earliest well-documented North Americans, resharpening is believed to have been particularly important because foraging territories were unknown or poorly known. Gardner (1983, Archaeol East N Amer 11, 49-64) proposed a spatial model of Clovis point resharpening wherein the effects of resharpening increase with distance from stone outcrop. Here we report a study that quantitatively assesses Gardner\u0027s model using a large sample of Clovis points from three high-quality chert sources in the Midwest. To investigate the predictions of the model, we used least-cost pathway distances from outcrop locations to each Clovis point and three measures of point resharpening. Our expectations, derived from the model, are that as distance from outcrop increases, points should show evidence of increased resharpening and therefore be smaller in size; should deviate from the classic shape; and should exhibit greater outer-to-inner flake-scar ratios. Our results indicate that there is no spatial patterning of these three measures of point resharpening and therefore do not support Gardner\u0027s model. Further analyses suggest that resharpening was not a significant source of Clovis-point variation at the population level and that Clovis points in the Midwest may not have served as the long-life tools as has been generally assumed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Size, shape, scars, and spatial patterning: A quantitative assessment of late Pleistocene (Clovis) point resharpening","volume":"3","authors with affiliations":"Buchanan, B., Department of Anthropology, University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK  74104, United States; Eren, M.I., Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO  65211, United States, Department of Archaeology, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Cleveland, OH  44106, United States; Boulanger, M.T., Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO  65211, United States, Archaeometry Laboratory, University of Missouri Research Reactor, Columbia, MO  65211, United States; O\u0027Brien, M.J., Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO  65211, United States","author(s) id":"11241802300;23975681200;15520464200;36128081000;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Clovis; Flake-scar pattern; Geometric morphometrics; Great Lakes; Least-cost pathway; Resharpening","pr_indegree":"7.0","authors":"Buchanan B., Eren M.I., Boulanger M.T., O\u0027Brien M.J.","doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.05.011"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":33.15999984741211},{"label":"Isaac G.L.","x":4546.2822265625,"y":-1818.122802734375,"id":"8570","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003874881","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.010309278350515464","authors with affiliations":"Isaac, G.L.","Modularity Class":"5","year":"1977","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Olorgesailie: Archaeological Studies of a Middle Pleistocene Lake Basin in Kenya","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"5.0","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Isaac G.L."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":25.399999618530273},{"label":"Strait D.S., Weber G.W., Neubauer S., Chalk J., Richmond B.G., Lucas P.W., Spencer M.A., Schrein C., Dechow P.C., Ross C.F., Grosse I.R., Wright B.W., Constantino P., Wood B.A., Lawn B., Hylander W.L., Wang Q., Byron C., Slice D.E., Smith A.L.","x":-1220.6907958984375,"y":-2900.11328125,"id":"9059","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-60549109629","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"7","year":"2009","page end":"2129","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-60549109629\u0026doi\u003d10.1073%2fpnas.0808730106\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d6892f6e5953387625a186a0ee9575bb4","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University at Albany, 1400 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12222, United States; Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz 6, 04103 Leipzig, Germany; Center for the Advanced Study of Hominid Paleobiology, Department of Anthropology, George Washington University, 2110 G Street NW, Washington, DC 20052, United States; Human Origins Program, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC 20560, United States; School of Human Evolution and Social Change, Institute of Human Origins, Arizona State University, Box 874101, Tempe, AZ 85287-4104, United States; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Texas A and M Health Science Center, Baylor College of Dentistry, 3302 Gaston Avenue, Dallas, TX 75246, United States; Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, University of Chicago, 1027 East 57th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, United States; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Massachusetts, 160 Governor\u0027s Drive, Amherst, MA 01003-2210, United States; Department of Anatomy, Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences, 1750 Independence Avenue, Kansas City, MO 64106-1453, United States; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8500, United States; Department of Biological Anthropology and Anatomy, Duke University, Box 90383, Durham, NC 27708-0383, United States; Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, 1550 College Street, Macon, GA 31207, United States; Department of Biology, Mercer University, 1400 Coleman Avenue, Macon, GA 31207, United States; Department of Scientific Computing, Florida State University, Dirac Science Library, Tallahassee, FL 32306-4120, United States","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","abstract":"The African Plio-Pleistocene hominins known as australopiths evolved a distinctive craniofacial morphology that traditionally has been viewed as a dietary adaptation for feeding on either small, hard objects or on large volumes of food. A historically influential interpretation of this morphology hypothesizes that loads applied to the premolars during feeding had a profound influence on the evolution of australopith craniofacial form. Here, we test this hypothesis using finite element analysis in conjunction with comparative, imaging, and experimental methods. We find that the facial skeleton of the Australopithecus type species, A. africanus, is well suited to withstand premolar loads. However, we suggest that the mastication of either small objects or large volumes of food is unlikely to fully explain the evolution of facial form in this species. Rather, key aspects of australopith craniofacial morphology are more likely to be related to the ingestion and initial preparation of large, mechanically protected food objects like large nuts and seeds. These foods may have broadened the diet of these hominins, possibly by being critical resources that australopiths relied on during periods when their preferred dietary items were in short supply.

They then spread across the Middle and Near East and westward into Europe alongside early agriculturalists. European pigs were either domesticated independently or more likely appeared so as a result of admixture between introduced pigs and European wild boar. As a result, European wild boar mtDNA lineages replaced Near Eastern/Anatolian mtDNA signatures in Europe and subsequently replaced indigenous domestic pig lineages in Anatolia. The specific details of these processes, however, remain unknown. To address questions related to early pig domestication, dispersal, and turnover in the Near East, we analyzed ancient mitochondrial DNA and dental geometric morphometric variation in 393 ancient pig specimens representing 48 archeological sites (from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic to the Medieval period) from Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. Our results reveal the first genetic signatures of early domestic pigs in the Near Eastern Neolithic core zone. We also demonstrate that these early pigs differed genetically from those in western Anatolia that were introduced to Europe during the Neolithic expansion. In addition, we present a significantly more refined chronology for the introduction of European domestic pigs into Asia Minor that took place during the Bronze Age, at least 900 years earlier than previously detected. By the 5th century AD, European signatures completely replaced the endemic lineages possibly coinciding with the widespread demographic and societal changes that occurred during the Anatolian Bronze and Iron Ages. © 2012 The Author 2012.

The pattern of facial cortical remodelling in this species is already well mapped from an earlier study. In this paper we consider the extent to which these remodelling maps relate to ontogenetic changes in size and shape of the face. This study is based on 31 facial landmarks taken from 49 adult and subadult faces. Our analysis draws on some of the tools of geometric morphometrics and we take this opportunity to describe our implementation of these tools for 3D data. The geometric analysis permits the known remodelling maps to be interpreted in the context of the general pattern of facial growth in this species. We are also able to examine sexual dimorphism in the face of this species and consider the extent to which males and females share similar ontogenetic allometries. Our findings indicate that the general pattern of size-related shape variation during facial growth is more or less identical for males and females up to eruption of the third permanent maxillary molar (M3). After this, ontogenetic allometries appear to diverge. The finding of a common growth allometry that is well approximated for younger specimens by a simple linear model is consistent with the earlier findings of a consistent pattern of facial remodelling up to M3 eruption. We consider the implications of these findings in terms of the potential for these approaches in the study of comparative growth in related species.","source":"Scopus","title":"Facial growth in Cercocebus torquatus: An application of three-dimensional geometric morphometric techniques to the study of morphological variation","volume":"193","page start":"251","authors with affiliations":"O\u0027Higgins, P., Evolutionary Anatomy Unit, Dept. of Anat. and Devmtl.

Because we lack genetic data from the time when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, between 200,000 and 60,000 years ago, instead we exploit the phenotype of neurocranial geometry to compare the variation in early modern human fossils with that in other groups of fossil Homo and recent modern humans. Variation is assessed as the mean-squared Procrustes distance from the group average shape in a representation based on several hundred neurocranial landmarks and semilandmarks. We find that the early modern group has more shape variation than any other group in our sample, which covers 1.8 million years, and that they are morphologically similar to recent modern humans of diverse geographically dispersed populations but not to archaic groups. Of the currently competing models of modern human origins, some are inconsistent with these findings. Rather than a single out-of-Af rica dispersal scenario, we suggest that early modern humans were already divided into different populations in Pleistocene Africa, after which there followed a complex migration pattern. Our conclusions bear implications for the inference of ancient human demography from genetic models and emphasize the importance of focusing research on those early modern humans, in particular, in Africa.","source":"Scopus","title":"Early modern human diversity suggests subdivided population structure and a complex out-of-Africa scenario","volume":"106","page start":"6094","authors with affiliations":"Gunz, P., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria, Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; Bookstein, F.L., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria, Department of Statistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, United States; Mitteroecker, P., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria, Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research, Adolf Lorenz Gasse 2, A-3422 Altenberg, Austria, Theoretical Biology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Stadlmayr, A., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Seidler, H., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; Weber, G.W., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","author(s) id":"6506472733;7004606384;6507135382;26536780900;7004117563;7402213147;","index keywords":"Africa; Antiquity; article; demography; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; geometry; human; migration; morphology; morphometrics; phenotype; Pleistocene; population structure; priority journal; animal; evolution; population dynamics; time; Africa; Animals; Evolution; Humans; Population Dynamics; Time Factors","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Early anatomically modern humans; Evolution; Migration; Morphological; Morphometrics","pr_indegree":"8.0","authors":"Gunz P., Bookstein F.L., Mitteroecker P., Stadlmayr A., Seidler H., Weber G.W.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0808160106"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":37.040000915527344},{"label":"Shott M., Trail B.","x":1569.0965576171875,"y":1380.5042724609375,"id":"8739","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84857114130","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.020618556701030927","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"2","year":"2010","source title":"Lithic Technology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Exploring New Approaches to Lithic Analysis: Laser Scanning and Geometric Morphometrics","volume":"35","authors with affiliations":"Shott, M.; Trail, B.","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"10.0","authors":"Shott M., Trail B."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":44.79999923706055},{"label":"Kuhl F.P., Giardina C.R.","x":-739.719970703125,"y":1225.3701171875,"id":"8440","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0019999399","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.016494845360824743","Modularity Class":"2","year":"1982","page end":"258","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0019999399\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2f0146-664X%2882%2990034-X\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dea63cbddf26061fc35c2e16d85041161","affiliations":"U.S. Army Armament Research and Development Command, Dover, NJ 07801, United States; Fairleigh Dickinson University, Teaneck, NJ 07070, United States","source title":"Computer Graphics and Image Processing","abstract":"A direct procedure for obtaining the Fourier coefficients of a chain-encoded contour is presented.

The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies. © 2017","source":"Scopus","title":"Archaeology, biology, and borrowing: A critical examination of Geometric Morphometrics in Archaeology","volume":"101","authors with affiliations":"Okumura, M., Laboratório de Estudos Evolutivos Humanos, Departamento de Genética e Biologia Evolutiva, Instituto de Biociências, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil; Araujo, A.G.M., Instituto de Estudos Avançados, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil, Museu de Arqueologia e Etnologia, Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil","author(s) id":"8562919300;36730594400;","index keywords":"archaeology; evolutionary biology; geometry; interdisciplinary approach; ontogeny; phylogenetics; tool use","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Evolutionary Archaeology; Geometric Morphometrics; Interdisciplinarity; Stone tools","pr_indegree":"2.0","authors":"Okumura M., Araujo A.G.M.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2017.09.015"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":13.760000228881836},{"label":"Walker P.L.","x":-5864.8935546875,"y":-1186.759521484375,"id":"8788","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84972320449","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"4","year":"1978","page end":"715","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84972320449\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f279502\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dfb301dba69920a8607ebfdb254c98d92","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA  93106, United States","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"Experiments were performed to determine the effectiveness of obsidian tools with different forms of edge treatment for animal processing.

Thus, exploring variability on the original designs can be informative of cultural adaptive processes on past populations. However, the complex life-cycle of a stone tool includes loops of damage due to use followed by breakage and resharpening that dramatically blur the size and shape attributes defining the original design. Here we use the Factor Model, a statistical approach recently modified to be used in landmark data, to evaluate original design attributes versus changes attributed to maintenance activities on a sample of Southern Patagonia lithic stemmed points, including arrows and spears. The model enables the separation of shape aspects that tend to covary because of common factors affecting simultaneously the two fundamental modules of a classical stemmed weapon (blade/stem), from those shape features explained only by local factors affecting modules independently. Our results show that original design differences explain most of the total shape variation, and also indicate that maintenance patterns differ among point types considered as different weapon systems (arrows and spears). Whereas arrow reduction is focused on tip modifications, spears present a broader array of shape changes including the tip and the shoulders. These results demonstrate that disentangling the sophisticated interaction among original design and maintenance activities of lithic projectile points enables a proper and independent exploration of adaptation to functional demands and cognitive models of past populations.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Identifying design and reduction effects on lithic projectile point shapes","volume":"41","page start":"297","authors with affiliations":"de Azevedo, S., Centro Nacional Patagónico-CONICET, Bvd.

A newly developed digitizing method is used to capture 12 interlandmark characters from coordinate data to describe point form. Principal components analysis is used to investigate size and shape variation in point form, and the symmetry and allometry of characters are used to explore the effects of resharpening on point dimensions. Size allometry illustrates the degree of association of relative point proportions, and other aspects of point form, with point size. Blade length, the leading edge of the weapon, was found to be isometric with point size, suggesting that this character was critical to the proper functioning of weapon tips. The regulation of blade length to point size supports a fixed-in-haft model for Folsom point resharpening. Multivariate analyses show that reduction in point forms do not correlate with distance-to-source but are more consistent with the model of the cyclical resharpening and replacement of points.

However, poor chronological control has dissuaded similar studies of fluted points found in Alaska and northern Yukon and our understanding of their adaptive role in early arctic adaptations remains unclear. Two new archeological sites have provided reliable radiocarbon data and for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of northern fluted points is possible. Here, technological and morphological analyses of northern fluted points are presented, including variables statistically evaluated and compared to a collection of fluted Folsom artifacts serving as a reference. Variation in tool shape was measured using geometric morphometrics, and a new approach to landmark placement designed to characterize basal morphology and allow the analysis to include tool fragments is presented. Results confirm that northern fluted points represent a cohesive technological strategy and are used to formulate hypotheses suggesting its service as a risk-management system promoting ease-of-replacement-after-failure to offset transport costs and reduce risk during long-distance travel. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","source":"Scopus","title":"The northern fluted point complex: technological and morphological evidence of adaptation and risk in the late Pleistocene-early Holocene Arctic","volume":"9","page start":"1799","authors with affiliations":"Smith, H.L., Center for the Study of the First Americans, Department of Anthropology, Texas A\u0026M University, College Station, TX  77843-4352, United States; DeWitt, T.J., Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences, Texas A\u0026M University, College Station, TX  77843-2258, United States","author(s) id":"55805377100;7005129580;","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Arctic archeology; Fluted projectile points; Geometric morphometrics; Late Paleoindian; Technological risk","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Smith H.L., DeWitt T.J.","doi":"10.1007/s12520-016-0335-y"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Walker P.L., Long J.C.","x":-5776.0908203125,"y":-2426.688720703125,"id":"9262","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0011577199","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.008247422680412371","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"4","year":"1977","page end":"616","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0011577199\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f278934\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d24cb2b63c79ad56d94932abc50088408","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA  93106, United States; Department of Anthropology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ  85281, United States","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"Experiments were performed to establish correlations between the edge characteristics of a series of tools and the marks they produce when applied to bone.

Several Paleolithic sites with lithic assemblages attributable to the Acheulean Industrial Complex (Mode 2) have yielded bifacial bone artifacts. Many of these bone implements are similar to classic handaxes in plan shape. The arbitrary imposition of form represented by these bone bifaces suggests the deliberate application of certain operational concepts that originate from particular Acheulean technological behaviors, namely, stone handaxe manufacture. In addition, the presence of these bone tools suggests an application of specific reductive techniques that originated in both Mode 1 (i.e., Oldowan) and Mode 2 (i.e., Acheulean) lithic technologies. How does the Acheulean model for stone biface shape compare to that observed for bone biface shape? In order to understand the degree to which Acheulean stone bifaces may have served as a model of form in flaked bone technology, an objective method for evaluating form is necessary. The dimensionless approach of geometric morphometrics was applied to the study of 2D bone and stone biface plan shape. The similarity of bone and stone bifaces from the Middle Pleistocene (∼300 kya) Acheulean site Castel di Guido, Latium, Italy was evaluated by a geometric morphometric analysis of 2D outlines. The null hypothesis that there is no difference in the 2D shape of each artifact material class was tested by principal component analysis (PCA) and MANOVA/CVA of eigenshape scores. Results of the analysis show no significant difference between the plan morphology of bone and stone bifaces. These results may indicate that Acheulean concepts of preferred 2D shape were applied in the production of some bifacial bone tools and that a great disparity in raw materials did not significantly influence 2D biface morphology. Furthermore, these results lend support to the idea that Mode 2 stone flaking techniques and tool types were directly applied to bone materials in some instances. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.","source":"Scopus","title":"A geometric morphometric assessment of plan shape in bone and stone acheulean bifaces from the Middle Pleistocene site of Castel di Guido, Latium, Italy","page start":"23","authors with affiliations":"Costa, A.G., Human Origins and Primate Evolution Laboratory (HOPE), Department of Anthropology, Indiana University, 107 S Indiana Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405, United States","author(s) id":"36999872500;","document type":"Book Chapter","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"11.0","authors":"Costa A.G.","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4419-6861-6_2"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":48.68000030517578},{"label":"Maté González M.T., Yravedra J., González-Aguilera D., Palomeque-González J.F., Domínguez-Rodrigo M.","x":-4543.17919921875,"y":406.4374694824219,"id":"9292","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84939196614","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.02268041237113402","Modularity Class":"3","year":"2015","page end":"142","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84939196614\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2015.08.006\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003da094740ad951c20a34351eaf2c2947c8","affiliations":"Department of Cartography and Terrain Engineering, Polytechnic School of Avila, University of Salamanca, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila, 05003, Spain; Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain; IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Museo de los Orígenes, Plaza de San Andrés 2, Madrid, 28005, Spain","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"In the last few years, the study of cut marks on bone surfaces has become fundamental for the interpretation of archaeological sites and prehistoric butchery practices.

A widely held assumption is that bifacial handaxe (i.e. Acheulean or \u0027Mode 2\u0027) technologies evolved in Africa and dispersed into northern and western Eurasia via subsequent hominin migrations. To date, however, few formal tests of this hypothesis have been presented. Here, we use a combination of morphometrics, cultural transmission theory, and a dispersal model drawn from population genetics in order to test this hypothesis. The iterative founder effect (repeated bottlenecking) model is assumed to be supported if a significant inverse relationship is found between geographic distance from source along an estimated dispersal route and within-assemblage variance. The results of our analyses support the hypothesis that Acheulean technologies evolved in Africa and dispersed with migrating hominin populations into northern and western Eurasia under the assumptions of this iterative founder effect model. Based on our results we suggest that the occurrence of certain Mode 1 technologies such as those east of the Movius Line, and some assemblages assigned to the Clactonian of Britain, plausibly represent instances where effective population sizes in colonising populations dropped below levels where Mode 2 technologies could be maintained. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Micromorphological analyses of cut-marks have been shown to further the interpretation of hominin behavioural patterns. However, to date, the microscopic investigation of cut-marks has been limited to two-dimensional analyses or to the qualitative assessment of three-dimensional (3D) morphology. A new technology using the Alicona 3D InfiniteFocus imaging microscope reported here surpasses any current observational or microscopic method for the analysis of cut-marks. By creating a series of image planes and overlapping focus levels to construct a 3D composite image, vertical variations in the surface structure can be used to interpret differences in the mechanical impact caused by different types of tool and different butchery techniques. Three case studies are presented. The first describes cut-marks observed on the human anterior teeth from the Middle Pleistocene site of Boxgrove (West Sussex, England) which are interpreted as indications of two possible types of human behaviour: the use of the mouth as a third hand and postmortem treatment of the body. The second case study, an analysis of cut-marks on human remains at the Later Upper Palaeolithic (Magdalenian) site of Gough\u0027s Cave (Somerset, England), questions the interpretation of cannibalism previously accepted for this site by suggesting the hypothesis of burial ritual involving the butchering, but not the consumption, of human bodies. Finally, the butchery techniques adopted at Boxgrove and Gough\u0027s Cave are compared. This third study indicates that differences in the micromorphological characteristics of cut-marks reflect diversity in the type of tools used at these two sites. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","source":"Scopus","title":"New Results from the Examination of Cut-Marks Using Three-Dimensional Imaging","volume":"14","page start":"249","authors with affiliations":"Bello, S.M., Department of Palaeontology, The Natural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London, SW7 5BD, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"10139236300;","document type":"Book","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Boxgrove; Butchery technique; Cannibalism; Cut-marks; Gough\u0027s Cave; Human behaviour","pr_indegree":"6.0","authors":"Bello S.M.","doi":"10.1016/B978-0-444-53597-9.00013-3"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":29.279998779296875},{"label":"Domínguez-Rodrigo M.","x":-4427.75732421875,"y":71.57075500488281,"id":"9213","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85053340004","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.010309278350515464","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"6","year":"2019","page end":"2725","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85053340004\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs12520-018-0684-9\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d6f26ec096877fe107e7b2d654ab1c897","affiliations":"Institute of Evolution in Africa (IDEA), University of Alcalá de Henares, Covarrubias 36, Madrid, 28010, Spain; Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Madrid, 28040, Spain","source title":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","abstract":"Here, I show that powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms can efficiently classify most BSM of any given controlled experimental assemblage.

The use of multivariate approaches in which variables are independently scored by the analyst introduces a subjective bias. In this work, I show that different analysts producing raw data on the same testing data set can lead to widely divergent BSM classifications and interpretations using the same powerful ML algorithms.

Among the principal difficulties in these evaluations is the absence of discrete, discernible, and comparable anatomical structures for rigorous quantitative assessment. Previous research has addressed either internal crown surface features (such as cusps and fossae) or the morphology of the crown outline. In the present paper, we integrate both types of information in the examination of morphological variation of lower P4s (n \u003d 96) among various fossil hominin species with an emphasis on genus Homo. We use a set of 34 2D landmarks combining coordinate data from four classical dental landmarks on the occlusal surface and 30 sliding semilandmarks of the crown outline. Our results indicate that external shape variation is closely related to the configuration of the occlusal morphological features and influenced by dental size. The external and internal shapes of P4 are polymorphic but still useful in depicting a primitive-derived gradient. The primitive pattern seems to have been an asymmetrical contour with a mesially displaced metaconid, development of a bulging talonid, and a broad occlusal polygon. The trend toward dental reduction during the Pleistocene produced different morphological variants with a reduced occlusal polygon and decreased lingual occlusal surface in later Homo species. Homo heidelbergensis/neanderthalensis have fixed plesiomorphic traits in high percentages, whereas in modern humans a symmetrical outline with a centered metaconid and talonid reduction evolved. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The lower archaeological levels of BK are characterized by anthropogenic activity related to the exploitation of megafauna (elephant, hippopotamus, Sivatherium) and smaller game (zebra, wildebeest and antelopes). These remains display a high frequency of cut marks. The exceptional state of preservation of the BK fossil assemblage has allowed a wide range of different analyses that, among other things, detected the use of quartzite in butchering activities through the study of cut marks. Following up previous analyses, this paper presents the study of a series of cut marks from the BK faunal assemblage using a 3D geometric morphometric methodological approach in order to determine the mineralogical properties of the quartzite used at the site. BK cut marks are compared with experimentally produced cut marks using 9 mineralogically different quartzite types from Olduvai Gorge. This comparative analysis provides valuable hints about the exact nature of the raw materials used in butchering activities.

There are several reasons handaxes are used for this purpose, but principal among these is the notion that handaxe shape is an arbitrary imposition of form, on varied raw material, that reflects shared mental templates. If this is so, then changes in handaxe shape through time and space may speak directly to evolving mental capabilities. It is argued here, however, that far too little attention has been paid to much simpler levels of explanation that may say much less about mental capabilities. This point is illustrated by re-examining some data sets that have been used by others to show patterns in handaxe shape interpreted as reflecting differences in mental constructs or for elevated mental abilities. It will be argued here that some very basic factors, such as raw materials and reduction intensity, are better able to explain the observed patterns. As a result, the existence of mental templates for preferred handaxe shapes seems unlikely.

One can thus incorporate information from incomplete specimens in a comparative morphometric analysis while keeping track of the uncertainties that result from partial preservation or deformation. We exemplify our approach by reconstructing the fossil crania Arago XXI, Taung, and KNM-WT 15000. As different assumptions and algorithms lead to different estimations, there exists no \"all-purpose\" reconstruction. Instead one creates multiple reconstructions-a posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense. This distribution reflects uncertainty due to missing data values and sensitivity to prior assumptions. While there will typically be shape differences among equally plausible reconstructions, these different estimates might still support a single conclusion. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although represented in only a handful of sites, the Still Bay is widespread geographically and, at certain localities, persisted over a substantial period of time. Many studies have focused on tracing the temporal range and geographic reach of the Still Bay, as well as inferring degrees of early modern human demographic connectedness from these parameters. Variation within the Still Bay, relative to the accuracy with which it can be identified, has received considerably less attention. However, demographic models based on the spread of the Still Bay in space and time hinge on the reliability with which it can be recognized in the archaeological record. Here we document patterns of bifacial point shape and size variation in some key Still Bay assemblages, and analyse these patterns using the statistical shape analysis tools of geometric morphometrics. Morphological variation appears to be geographically structured and is driven by the spatial separation between north-eastern and south-western clusters of sites. We argue that allometric variation is labile and reflects environmentally driven differences in point reduction, whereas shape differences unrelated to size more closely reflect technological and cultural fragmentation. Our results suggest that the biogeographic structure of Middle Stone Age populations was complex during the period associated with the Still Bay, and provide little support for heightened levels of cultural interconnectedness between distantly separated groups at this time. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for tracing classic techno-traditions in the Middle Stone Age record of southern Africa, and for inferring underpinning population dynamics from these patterns. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"What is Still Bay?

Thus, metal tool use has been differentiated in contexts with an abundance of lithic tools, or even the use of hand axes has been documented in carcass processing, in contrast with simple unretouched or retouched flakes. As important as this information is, there are still other important aspects to be analysed. Can cut marks produced with different lithic raw material types be differentiated? Can cut marks made with different types of the same raw material type be characterized and differentiated? The objective of this study is to evaluate if cut marks resulting from the use of different flints and different quartzites are distinguishable from each other. In the present work, an experimental analysis of hundreds of cut marks produced by five types of flint and five varieties of quartzite was carried out. Microphotogrammetry and geometric–morphometric techniques were applied to analyse these cut marks. The results show that flint cut marks and quartzite cut marks can be characterized at the assemblage level. Different types of flint produced cut marks that were not significantly different from each other. Cut marks made with Olduvai Gorge quartzite were significantly different from those produced with a set comprising several other types of quartzites. Crystal size, which is larger in Olduvai Gorge quartzites (0.5 mm) than Spanish quartzites (177–250 μm), is discussed as being the main reason for these statistically significant differences. This documented intra-sample and inter-sample variance does not hinder the resolution of the approach to differentiate between these two generic raw material types and opens the door for the application of this method in archaeological contexts. © 2017 University of Oxford","source":"Scopus","title":"Flint and Quartzite: Distinguishing Raw Material Through Bone Cut Marks","volume":"60","page start":"437","authors with affiliations":"Maté-González, M.Á., Department of Cartography and Terrain Engineering, Polytechnic School of Avila, University of Salamanca, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila, 05003, Spain, C.A.I.

It is often assumed that this change is associated with dietary expansion to incorporate large mammal resources. Although other aspects of the hominin diet, such as aquatic or vegetal resources, are assumed to be a part of hominin subsistence, identifying evidence of these adaptations has proved difficult. Here we present a series of analyses that provide methodological support for the inclusion of aquatic resources in hominin dietary reconstructions. We suggest that bone surface modifications in aquatic species are morphologically distinguishable from bone surface modifications on terrestrial taxa. We relate these findings to differences that we document in the surface mechanical properties of the two types of bone, as reflected by significant differences in bone surface microhardness values between aquatic and terrestrial species. We hypothesize that the characteristics of bone surface modifications on aquatic taxa inhibit the ability of zooarchaeologists to consistently diagnose them correctly. Contingently, this difficulty influences correspondence levels between zooarchaeologists, and may therefore result in misinterpretation of the taphonomic history of early Pleistocene aquatic faunal assemblages. A blind test using aquatic specimens and a select group of 9 experienced zooarchaeologists as participants was designed to test this hypothesis. Investigation of 4 different possible explanations for blind test results suggest the dominant factors explaining patterning relate to (1) the specific methodologies employed to diagnose modifications on aquatic specimens and (2) the relative experience of participants with modifications on aquatic bone surfaces. Consequently we argue that an important component of early hominin diets may have hitherto been overlooked as a result of (a) the paucity of referential frameworks within which to identify such a component and (b) the inability of applied identification methodologies to consistently do so. © 2013 Archer, Braun.","source":"Scopus","title":"Investigating the Signature of Aquatic Resource Use within Pleistocene Hominin Dietary Adaptations","volume":"8","authors with affiliations":"Archer, W., Human Evolution Department, Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany; Braun, D.R., Human Evolution Department, Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany, Archaeology Department, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa, George Washington University, Center for the Advanced Study of Hominin Paleobiology, Washington DC, United States","author(s) id":"35085743300;23972180300;","index keywords":"aquatic fauna; aquatic species; archeology; article; bone characteristics and functions; bone examination; bone structure; bone surface microhardness; dietary intake; evolutionary adaptation; fossil hominin; Pleistocene; resource management; species difference; terrestrial species; zoology; Animals; Bone and Bones; Catfishes; Cichlids; Diet; Food Handling; Hominidae; Kenya; Paleontology; Principal Component Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Tool Use Behavior","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"e69899","pr_indegree":"4.0","authors":"Archer W., Braun D.R.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0069899"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":21.520000457763672},{"label":"Santonja M., Panera J., Rubio-Jara S., Pérez-González A., Uribelarrea D., Domínguez-Rodrigo M., Mabulla A.Z.P., Bunn H.T., Baquedano E.","x":-4946.125,"y":-490.7734375,"id":"8370","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84893865608","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"3","year":"2014","page end":"208","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84893865608\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.quaint.2013.10.069\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d317d6e221b0c23f19c585becca99cd19","affiliations":"CENIEH (Centro Nacional de Investigación sobre la Evolución Humana), Economic and Spatial Archaeology, Paseo Sierra de Atapuerca s/n, 09002 Burgos, Spain; IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Museo de los Orígenes, Plaza de San Andrés 2, 28005 Madrid, Spain; Department of Geodynamics, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain; Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain; Archaeology Unit, University of Dar es Salaam, P.O.

TK is located at the exposed top of Olduvai\u0027s Bed II, recently dated to 1.353 ± 0.035 Ma.

The new interpretation focuses particularly on the technological and paleoeconomic study of a new lithic assemblage recovered from the lower occupation level (TKLF). This assemblage comprises 5805 objects in total, including 3812 items of shatter. We analyse here the chaînes opératoires represented in this level, as well as the processes implied by the raw materials, management, maintenance and abandonment of the lithic assemblage.The character of the site, as well as the activities carried out in it, have been greatly influenced by the proximity of the sources of the raw material primarily used, which could have been extracted from an inselberg of a particular type of quartzite located within a few hundred meters of the site. Two different chaînes opératoires can be identified in TKLF: one based on obtaining flakes from varied blanks, particularly volcanic rocks and the distinctive quartzite, and the second on the manufacture of large and highly standardized bifaces that were produced, used and abandoned in the site. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.","source":"Scopus","title":"Technological strategies and the economy of raw materials in the TK (Thiongo Korongo) lower occupation, Bed II, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania","page start":"181","authors with affiliations":"Santonja, M., CENIEH (Centro Nacional de Investigación sobre la Evolución Humana), Economic and Spatial Archaeology, Paseo Sierra de Atapuerca s/n, 09002 Burgos, Spain; Panera, J., IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Museo de los Orígenes, Plaza de San Andrés 2, 28005 Madrid, Spain; Rubio-Jara, S., IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Museo de los Orígenes, Plaza de San Andrés 2, 28005 Madrid, Spain; Pérez-González, A., CENIEH (Centro Nacional de Investigación sobre la Evolución Humana), Economic and Spatial Archaeology, Paseo Sierra de Atapuerca s/n, 09002 Burgos, Spain; Uribelarrea, D., Department of Geodynamics, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain; Domínguez-Rodrigo, M., IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Museo de los Orígenes, Plaza de San Andrés 2, 28005 Madrid, Spain, Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain; Mabulla, A.Z.P., Archaeology Unit, University of Dar es Salaam, P.O.

Broadly defined as \"small-bodied Homo sapiens\" (compared with neighboring populations), their origins and the nature of the processes involved in the maintenance of their phenotype over time are highly debated. Major results have been recently obtained from population genetics on present-day negrito populations, but their evolutionary history remains largely unresolved. We present and discuss the Upper Pleistocene human remains recovered from Tabon Cave and Callao Cave in the Philippines, which are potentially highly relevant to these research questions. Human fossils have been recovered in large numbers from Tabon Cave (Palawan Island) but mainly from reworked and mixed sediments from several archaeological layers. We review and synthesize the long and meticulous collaborative work done on the archives left from the 1960s excavations and on the field. The results demonstrate the long history of human occupations in the cave, since at least ~30,000 BP. The examination of the Tabon human remains shows a large variability: large and robust for one part of the sample, and small and gracile for the other part. The latter would fit quite comfortably within the range of variation of Philippine negritos. Farther north, on Luzon Island, the human third metatarsal recently recovered from Callao Cave and dated to ~66,000 BP is now the oldest direct evidence of human presence in the Philippines. Previous data show that, compared with H. sapiens (including Philippine negritos), this bone presents a very small size and several unusual morphological characteristics. We present a new analytical approach using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics for comparing the Callao fossil to a wide array of extant Asian mammals, including nonhuman primates and H. sapiens. The results demonstrate that the shape of the Callao metatarsal is definitely closer to humans than to any other groups. The fossil clearly belongs to the genus Homo; however, it remains at the margin of the variation range of H. sapiens. Because of its great antiquity and the presence of another diminutive species of the genus Homo in the Wallace area during this time period (H. floresiensis), we discuss here in detail the affinities and potential relatedness of the Callao fossil with negritos that are found today on Luzon Island. © 2013 Wayne State University Press.","source":"Scopus","title":"\"Small size\" In the Philippine human fossil record: Is it meaningful for a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the negritos?","volume":"85","page start":"45","authors with affiliations":"Détroit, F., UMR7194, Département de Préhistoire, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Paris, France; Corny, J., UMR7194, Département de Préhistoire, Muséum national d\u0027Histoire naturelle, Paris, France, Dipartimento di Biologia ed Evoluzione, Università degli Studi di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy; Dizon, E.Z., Archaeology Division, National Museum of the Philippines, Manila, Philippines; Mijares, A.S., University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines","author(s) id":"6504774261;55928735500;23391946100;35574282200;","index keywords":"animal; archeology; Asian continental ancestry group; ethnology; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; genetics; hominid; human; phenotype; Philippines; physical anthropology; population dynamics; population genetics; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Archaeology; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biological Evolution; Fossils; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Hominidae; Humans; Phenotype; Philippines; Population Dynamics","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Callao cave; Homo sapiens; Philippines; Small body-size; Tabon cave; Upper pleistocene","pr_indegree":"1.0","authors":"Détroit F., Corny J., Dizon E.Z., Mijares A.S.","doi":"10.3378/027.085.0303"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":9.880000114440918},{"label":"Topi J.R., VanPool C.S., Waller K.D., VanPool T.L.","x":590.0958862304688,"y":437.8058166503906,"id":"8812","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85043300263","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.002061855670103093","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"1","year":"2018","page end":"142","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85043300263\u0026doi\u003d10.1017%2flaq.2017.62\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d62e6274e500ef8c9539f17f0b57bb237","affiliations":"Swallow Department 202, Department of Anthropology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO  65211, United States","source title":"Latin American Antiquity","abstract":"Recent analyses use geometric morphometrics (GM), the quantitative study of shape and its variation, to examine aspects of the archaeological record. Our research builds on such applications to examine the organization of production by applying GM analysis to whole ceramic vessels from the Casas Grandes culture of northwest Mexico. We quantify variation in vessel shape and size and conclude that specialists made at least some of the Ramos and Babicora Polychromes, but that the other Casas Grandes ceramic types were generally made by nonspecialists. This bolsters arguments for Medio period (AD 1200 to 1450) specialized production above the household level but indicates that specialized production was limited to a subset of economically valuable goods. We further suggest some Ramos Polychrome was made by attached specialists associated with elites at Paquime, the religious center of the Medio period, whereas some Babicora Polychrome was made by independent specialists. The analysis contributes to three important anthropological topics: (1) the study of the Medio period Casas Grandes culture, and by extension the organization of production in mid-level hierarchically organized societies; (2) geometric morphometric analysis of archaeological collections; and (3) the Standardization Hypothesis and the relationship between artifact standardization and the organization of production.

According to this hypothesis, hafting constrained point bases such that they are less variable than point blades. The results of several studies have been claimed to be consistent with this hypothesis. However, there are reasons to be skeptical of these results. None of the studies employed statistical tests, and all of them focused on points recovered from kill and camp sites, which makes it difficult to be certain that the differences in variability are the result of hafting rather than a consequence of resharpening. Here, we report a study in which we tested the predictions of the hafting hypothesis by statistically comparing the variability of different parts of Clovis points. We controlled for the potentially confounding effects of resharpening by analyzing largely unused points from caches as well as points from kill and camp sites. The results of our analyses were not consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis. We found that several blade characters and point thickness were no more variable than the base characters.

Methods: To do so, three transitional populations were analyzed, including samples from groups that inhabited the same geographical region and for which the evidence shows that major changes occurred in their subsistence mode. Ninety three-dimensional landmarks were digitized on 357 skulls and used as the raw data to develop geometric morphometric analyses. The landmark coordinates were divided into several different regions of biomechanical interest, following a three-level hierarchically nested scheme: the whole skull, further subdivided into neurocranium (divided into the vault and basicranium), the facial (divided into the lower and upper facial), and the masticatory apparatus (divided into alveolar, temporal, and temporo-mandibular joint). Results: Our results indicate that the morphological integration and variability patterns significantly vary across skull regions but are maintained across the transitions. The alveolar border and the lower facial are the regions manifesting greater value of morphological integration and variability, while the upper facial, the temporo-mandibular joint, and the basicranium are highly integrated and poorly variable.

Within an ISPRS Scientific Initiative a team of researchers from USAL, UCLM, FBK and UNIBO have developed an open photogrammetric tool, called GRAPHOS (inteGRAted PHOtogrammetric Suite). GRAPHOS allows to obtain dense and metric 3D point clouds from terrestrial and UAV images. It encloses robust photogrammetric and computer vision algorithms with the following aims: (i) increase automation, allowing to get dense 3D point clouds through a friendly and easy-to-use interface; (ii) increase flexibility, working with any type of images, scenarios and cameras; (iii) improve quality, guaranteeing high accuracy and resolution; (iv) preserve photogrammetric reliability and repeatability. Last but not least, GRAPHOS has also an educational component reinforced with some didactical explanations about algorithms and their performance.

For this reason, studies focusing on purported early hominid hunting and butchery sites are important if rigorous criteria for recognizing such sites are used. Different criteria currently used as evidence of hominid involvement with ancient bones are reviewed and it is concluded that the presence of cutmarks, verified by scanning electron microscope (SEM) inspection, is the most reliable. Successful application of this criterion depends upon a thorough knowledge of the normal variations in microscopic morphology of different types of marks that are found on bones. Therefore, variations in microscopic and gross morphology within and among a large sample of known stone tool cutmarks, carnivore tooth scratches, and rodent gnawing marks are documented. The effects of sedimentary abrasion, as caused by fluvial transport of bones, are also presented. Guidelines are presented for using microscopic criteria to identify unknown marks on fossils and possible applications of this approach are discussed. Further, it is suggested that evidence of hominid carcass-processing activities can be placed into one of three ranked categories of certainty according to the type of data used. Explicitly stating the category and type of evidence used to deduce hominid activities, and by extension to define site types (i.e., butchery, kill, base camp), may improve the clarity of hypotheses about and interpretations of early hominid behaviors. © 1983.","source":"Scopus","title":"Early hominid hunting, butchering, and carcass-processing behaviors: Approaches to the fossil record","volume":"2","page start":"57","authors with affiliations":"Shipman, P., Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 725 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States; Rose, J., Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 725 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States","author(s) id":"7004475336;7404390659;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Shipman P., Rose J.","doi":"10.1016/0278-4165(83)90008-9"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Estévez E.J., López-Lázaro S., López-Morago C., Alemán I., Botella M.C.","x":-104.27003479003906,"y":-664.3363647460938,"id":"3814","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85027376379","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"6","year":"2017","page end":"1756","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85027376379\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs00414-017-1659-6\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d8065d6620f2cb368033326b174d9d3c5","affiliations":"Laboratory of Anthropology, Department of Legal Medicine, Toxicology and Physical Anthropology, University of Granada, Granada, 18012, Spain; Laboratory of Forensic Dentistry, Center for Applied Morphology Research, Faculty of Dentistry, Universidad de La Frontera, Temuco, 4780000, Chile","source title":"International Journal of Legal Medicine","abstract":"In archeology or forensics, the analysis of the ilia is often used to determine the age and sex of unknown individuals.

After electronic restoration, the isolated original pieces were recomposed on the computer screen using external and internal anatomical clues to position the bone fragments and mirror images to complete missing parts. The inferred effects of general compressive deformation that occurred during fossilization were corrected by virtual decompression of the skull. The resulting new reconstruction of the Le Moustier 1 skull shows morphologic features close to the typical Neanderthal adult state. Residual asymmetry of skeletal parts can be traced to in vivo skeletal modification: the left mandibular joint shows signs of a healed condylar fracture, and the anatomy of the occipital region suggests mild plagiocephaly. Using micro-CT analysis, the left incus could be recovered from the matrix filling of the middle ear cavity. Its morphometric dimensions are similar to those of the La Ferrassie III incus.

Modules are integrated internally by many interactions among their component parts, but are linked to one another only by few or weak interactions. Accordingly, traits within modules are tightly correlated with each other, but relatively independent of traits in other modules. Hypotheses concerning the boundaries of modules in a landmark configuration can therefore be tested by comparing the strength of covariation among alternative partitions of the configuration into subsets of landmarks. If a subdivision coincides with the true boundaries between modules, the correlations among subsets should be minimal. This article introduces Escoufier\u0027s RV coefficient and the multi-set RV coefficient as measures of the correlation between two or more subsets of landmarks. These measures can be compared between alternative partitions of the configuration into subsets. Because developmental interactions are tissue bound, it is sensible to require that modules should be spatially contiguous.

When too few landmarks are available, outlines can be digitized as series of discrete points. The individual points must be slid along a tangential direction so as to remove tangential variation, because contours should be homologous from subject to subject whereas their individual points need not. This variation can be removed by minimizing either bending energy (BE) or Procrustes distance (D) with respect to a mean reference form. Because these two criteria make different assumptions, it becomes necessary to study how these differences modify the results obtained. We performed bootstrapped-based Goodall\u0027s F-test, Foote\u0027s measurement, principal component (PC) and discriminant function analyses on human molars and craniometric data to compare the results obtained by the two criteria. Results show that: (1) F-scores and P-values were similar for both criteria; (2) results of Foote\u0027s measurement show that both criteria yield different estimates of within- and between-sample variation; (3) there is low correlation between the first PC axes obtained by D and BE; (4) the percentage of correct classification is similar for BE and D, but the ordination of groups along discriminant scores differs between them.

Some common pitfalls of these methods when used to analyze fossil specimens are: (1) ignoring the possibility that a fossil belongs to a group other than one of the predefined reference samples (i.e., restricted versus unrestricted approaches to classification), (2) misinterpreting probabilities of group membership (i.e., posterior versus typicality probabilities), and (3) failing to understand how sample sizes influence multivariate ordinations in trying to effectively illustrate the morphometric affinities of a fossil (i.e., weighted versus unweighted analyses with fossils entered indirectly or directly into the analysis). To better understand canonincal variate analysis and generalized distances, the workings of these methods are portrayed graphically as a series of rotations and rescaling of data plotted in a multivariate data space. The influence of sample sizes and the importance of higher-numberer canonical variates are emphasized.

Beyond paleopathological diagnosis, however, it is often difficult to gain insight into the processes, mechanisms, and consequences of the pathology, notably because archaeological specimens are often fragmentary. Here, we propose a combination of virtual reconstruction (VR) and geometric morphometrics (GM) to address these issues. As an example, we use VR to reconstruct the only known archaeological specimen exhibiting persistence of the pelvic triradiate cartilage and compare it via GM with a set of healthy pelvises representing both sexes and different ontogenetic stages. Our results evidence (i) a marked deviation of the pathological pelvis from the adult mean shape, (ii) the retention of typical male features, and (iii) the retention of a paedomorphic ratio between iliac and ischiopubic size. Altogether, such data offer new insights into the modularity and integration of pelvic ontogeny, while at the same time demonstrating the usefulness of a combined VR/GM approach as complement to classical methods of paleopathology.

There are numerous studies suggesting Oldowan hominins preferred certain types of stone for artifact manufacture. Previous studies of the artifact assemblage from the early Pliocene Oldowan locality of Kanjera South (South Rachuonyo District, Kenya) show that raw material selection and transport was an important aspect of Late Pliocene hominin adaptations. Yet the exact properties of stones that hominins were selecting remain enigmatic. Two potentially important features of artifact raw material are durability and fracture predictability. We investigate fracture predictability through mechanical tests of stone and investigations of the affect of stone properties on fracture patterns in archaeological collections. We investigate stone durability with actualistic studies of edge attrition combined with further mechanical tests of various lithologies. Oldowan hominins at Kanjera appear to have selected raw materials based on their durability. The ability for a stone to fracture consistently does not appear to be as important in hominin toolstone preference as previously assumed. Hominins that produced the assemblages at Kanjera South appear to have incorporated an extensive understanding of various attributes of raw material in the transport and production of stone artifacts. When combined with previous research on the transport patterns at Kanjera, the results of this study provide evidence for a more complex raw material acquisition strategy than has previously been suggested for Late Pliocene Oldowan hominins. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In southern France this cereal is common in carbonized contexts such as cultural layers, ditches, pits, hearths, etc. The distinction between the two subspecies, two-rowed (. Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L.) and six-rowed barley (. H.vulgare subsp. vulgare L.) is usually based on morphological characters. The following criteria can be used to discriminate both subspecies from archaeological remains: the number of fertile spikelets per rachis segments, the linear or horseshoe shape depression of the lemma base, the maximum width of the caryopses and the proportion of twisted grains. The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for two-rowed barley is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of two-rowed barley in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1st to the 11th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Geometric morphometric analysis of grain shape and the identification of two-rowed barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichumL.) in southern France","volume":"41","authors with affiliations":"Ros, J., CNRS, Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, UMR 7209, Archéozoologie, Archéobotanique - Sociétés, Pratiques et Environnements, 55 rue Buffon, 75005 Paris, France; Evin, A., CNRS, Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, UMR 7209, Archéozoologie, Archéobotanique - Sociétés, Pratiques et Environnements, 55 rue Buffon, 75005 Paris, France, Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, St. Mary\u0027s Building, Elphinstone Road, Aberdeen AB24 3UF, United Kingdom; Bouby, L., CNRS, Centre de Bio-Archéologie et d\u0027Ecologie, UMR 5059, UM2/CNRS/EPHE, 163 Rue A.

In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered.

Its frequent preservation in the fossil record gives the temporal bone added significance in the study of human evolution, but its morphology has proven difficult to quantify. In this study we use techniques of 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify differences among humans and great apes and discuss the results in a phylogenetic context. Twenty-three landmarks on the ectocranial surface of the temporal bone provide a high level of anatomical detail. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) is used to register (adjust for position, orientation and scale) landmark data from 405 adults representing Homo, Pan, Gorilla and Pongo. Principal components analysis of residuals from the GPA shows that the major source of variation is between humans and apes. Human characteristics such as a coronally orientated petrous axis, a deep mandibular fossa, a projecting mastoid process, and reduced lateral extension of the tympanic element strongly impact the analysis. In phenetic cluster analyses, gorillas and orangutans group together with respect to chimpanzees, and all apes group together with respect to humans. Thus, the analysis contradicts depictions of African apes as a single morphotype. Gorillas and orangutans lack the extensive preglenoid surface of chimpanzees, and their mastoid processes are less medially inflected. These and other characters shared by gorillas and orangutans are probably primitive for the African hominid clade.","source":"Scopus","title":"Quantifying temporal bone morphology of great apes and humans: An approach using geometric morphometrics","volume":"201","authors with affiliations":"Lockwood, C.A., Department of Anthropology, Institute of Human Origins, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, United States; Lynch, J.M., Barrett Honors College, Institute of Human Origins, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, United States; Kimbel, W.H., Department of Anthropology, Institute of Human Origins, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, United States","author(s) id":"7102516713;25934906700;6603930109;","index keywords":"Africa; analytic method; Anthropoidea; ape; article; bone structure; chimpanzee; cladistics; cluster analysis; comparative anatomy; controlled study; craniofacial morphology; evolution; fossil; geographical variation (species); geometry; gorilla; hominid; human; human versus animal comparison; mandible; mastoid; middle ear; morphometrics; morphotype; nonhuman; orang utan; Pan paniscus; petrous bone; phylogeny; priority journal; register; structure analysis; temporal bone; Adult; Animals; Gorilla gorilla; Hominidae; Humans; Pan troglodytes; Phylogeny; Pongo pygmaeus; Temporal Bone; Alocasia macrorrhizos; Animalia; Anthropoidea; Hominidae; Homo; Pan (ape); Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Paniscus; Pongo; Pongo pygmaeus; Procrustes","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Geometric morphometrics; Hominids; Hominoids; Relative warp analysis; Thin-plate spline analysis","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Lockwood C.A., Lynch J.M., Kimbel W.H.","doi":"10.1046/j.1469-7580.2002.00122.x"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Zanolli C., Pan L., Dumoncel J., Kullmer O., Kundrát M., Liu W., Macchiarelli R., Mancini L., Schrenk F., Tuniz C.","x":-1221.9415283203125,"y":-1894.75439453125,"id":"3139","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85040583268","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"4","year":"2018","page end":"13","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85040583268\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jhevol.2017.11.002\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d36d86c9f07bfc80720255e78582ebe27","affiliations":"UMR 5288 CNRS, Université Toulouse III – Paul Sabatier, France; Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, CAS, Beijing, China; State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy, Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS, Nanjing, China; Department of Palaeoanthropology, Senckenberg Research Institute, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Department of Paleobiology and Environment, Institute of Ecology, Evolution, and Diversity, Goethe University, Max-von-Laue-Str. 13, Frankfurt, 60438, Germany; Center for Interdisciplinary Biosciences, Technology and Innovation Park, Pavol Jozef Safarik University, Kosice, Slovakia; UMR 7194 CNRS, Muséum National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France; Unité de Formation Géosciences, University of Poitiers, France; Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A., Basovizza (Trieste), Italy; Multidisciplinary Laboratory, The ‘Abdus Salam’ International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy; Centro Fermi, Museo Storico della Fisica, Rome, Italy; Center for Archaeological Science, University of Wollongong, Australia","source title":"Journal of Human Evolution","abstract":"Locality 1, in the Lower Cave of the Zhoukoudian cave complex, China, is one of the most important Middle Pleistocene paleoanthropological and archaeological sites worldwide, with the remains of c. 45 Homo erectus individuals, 98 mammalian taxa, and thousands of lithic tools recovered.

This small sample consists of an upper canine (PMU 25719), an upper third molar (PMU M3550), a lower third premolar crown (PMU M3549), and a lower fourth premolar (PMU M3887). Some researchers have noted the existence of morpho-dimensional differences between the Zhoukoudian and the H. erectus dental assemblage from Sangiran, Java. However, compared to its chrono-geographical distribution, the Early to Middle Pleistocene dental material currently forming the Chinese-Indonesian H. erectus hypodigm is quantitatively meager and still poorly characterized for the extent of its endostructural variation.

Here we address the morphometric diversity of wild rabbits in seven current populations from south-western Europe. Size variations in different skeletal parts were analysed to explore the potential impact of sexual dimorphism. A geometric morphometric analysis of the third lower premolar (p3) - a tooth commonly used to distinguish leporid species - was used to evaluate the relative effects of size, phylogeny, geographical location and climate on shape variation. The results show a negligible impact of sexual dimorphism, contradicting previous studies. We also demonstrate geography and climate to be the main factors driving variation in p3 shape, potentially calling into question criteria typically used to identify rabbit species.

Finally, the technique’s application was demonstrated for inter-sample comparison through analysis of the principal component (PC) weights.

The hypotheses advanced by Bunn (1986; Bunn and Kroll, 1986) and Leakey (1971), and by Binford (1981, 1986) are tested using the proportion of long bone specimens bearing hammerstone percussion marks and carnivore tooth marks. Unambiguous test implications based on surface mark frequencies are provided by results of well controlled experiments and naturalistic observations that model three alternative sequences of long bone processing and consumption by hominids and/or carnivores. Percussion mark and tooth mark frequencies, reported systematically for the first time on the assemblage from FLK Zinjanthropus, allow the rejection of the hypothesis that carnivores rather than hominids at FLK Zinjanthropus enjoyed first access to marrow in long bone cavities. This result contradicts Binford\u0027s characterization of Plio-Pleistocene hominids as marginal scavengers of carcasses heavily ravaged by bone-crunching carnivores. However, a high proportion of tooth-marked long bone midshaft fragments allows the rejection of the alternative hypothesis that carnivore access to long bones was exclusively or even primarily secondary to butchery and marrow extraction by hominids, as argued by Bunn (1986; Bunn and Kroll, 1986) and Leakey (1971). The results show that the sequence of carnivore and hominid access to long bones, and their respective carcass tissue yields, was more complex, as is consistent with a dominantly passive scavenging mode of carcass acquisition by hominids hypothesized earlier on the basis of skeletal part data and paleoecological considerations. Confidence in these deductions based on surface mark frequencies is increased by demonstrations of (i) a close comparability in agencies of bone fragmentation between the control samples and FLK Zinjanthropus; (ii) the representativeness of the control samples with respect to the process-pattern relationship between marrow/grease extraction and frequencies of surface marking; and (iii) the energetic and mechanical uniformities linking rates of bone surface marking to the timing of carnivore and hominid access to long bone nutrients. © 1995 Academic Press.

Which human populations settled them? When, why and how? Where did they come from? Did environment influence these migrations? An exhaustive discussion of these vast questions could not be undertaken rigorously within the framework of this short article. We thus propose to discuss here very precise points that could bring a new lighting on the first settlements of South Pacific. According to the oldest archaeological sites of Australia, first arrivals of Homo sapiens in the area occurred at least 40 000 years ago, and possibly as early as 50 to 60 ka BP. From a palaeoanthropological point of view, the question of the origin of these anatomically modern H. sapiens is under debate for several years: did they come from a relatively recent \u0027out of Africa\u0027 migration (Out-of-Africa hypothesis) or did they evolve locally from the last Indonesian H. erectus (multiregional hypothesis)? Partisans of these two models disagree on several fundamental points, and particularly on the interpretation of certain morphometric affinities between the most recent Indonesian H. erectus and the \u0027robust\u0027 Australian fossil H. sapiens from Kow Swamp and Cohuna. The application of 3D geometric morphometrics (Procrustes analysis) makes it possible to approach this question under a new angle. The shapes of these two sets of fossil hominids are clearly distinct, questioning seriously the assumption of a local direct evolution. For these oldest human settlements as well as for later migrations, multidisciplinary studies (archaeology, palaeoenvironment, palaeoanthropology, genetic, and linguistic) allow us to reconstruct the outlines of the first human settlements of these areas. Climate and environment interacted with these migrations of populations. The very first example is the formation of land bridges between Asian mainland and the Indonesian archipelago during Quaternary glaciations allowing the passage of humans and fauna. And periods of lower sea levels possibly also favoured dispersion from islands to islands. Winds and sea currents, directly related with climate and its variations, also intervened in the settlement of the Pacific. Natural environment, which is impoverished eastward, has been enriched by animals and plants transported by humans. In relation to their way of life as well as to available resources, peoples initially settled littoral zones (Lapita sites), then moved inland very quickly, as demonstrated by excavations carried out in the North of Grande Terre, New Caledonia.

Metrical methods are the most commonly used; these are reviewed. Assemblages containing a wider range of measurements (as measured by the coefficient of variation [V]) than is found in one population suggest that two populations of different-sized pigs were present, probably indicating separate wild and domestic populations with little or no interbreeding. These assemblages, sometimes taken to indicate animals \u0027intermediate\u0027 between wild and domestic, are clear evidence of full domestication. Other traditional means of diagnosing domestication based on age at death (the killing of many young animals) and biogeography (the export of the animal beyond its natural range, especially to islands) are particularly problematic when applied to pigs. New methods include the frequency of Linear Enamel Hypoplasia, which may increase due to domestication-induced stress, the study of diet through isotopes and dental microwear, and the examination of population histories through ancient and modern DNA and geometric morphometrics. These are all promising but should not be considered in isolation: many problems remain. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","source":"Scopus","title":"Distinguishing Wild Boar from Domestic Pigs in Prehistory: A Review of Approaches and Recent Results","volume":"25","page start":"1","authors with affiliations":"Rowley-Conwy, P., Department of Archaeology, Durham University, South Road, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom; Albarella, U., Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom; Dobney, K., Department of Archaeology, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"57204378841;8267110000;6602595568;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; diet; DNA; domestication; historical perspective; isolation effect; morphometry; pig; Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; Sus scrofa domestica","document type":"Review","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Domestic pig; Domestication; Methods; Old World; Wild boar","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Rowley-Conwy P., Albarella U., Dobney K.","doi":"10.1007/s10963-012-9055-0"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Yravedra Sainz de los Terreros J., Maté-González M.Á., Courtenay L.A.","x":-3598.235107421875,"y":-1616.021728515625,"id":"832","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85068446514","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"3","year":"2019","page end":"3","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85068446514\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.quaint.2019.06.030\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d50ef51d30e4ecff1832984f09ac93db0","affiliations":"Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain; Department of Cartographic and Land Engineering, Higher Polytechnic School of Avila, University of Salamanca, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila, 05003, Spain; Àrea de Prehisòria, Universita Rovira I Virgili (URV), Avignuda de Catalunya 35, Tarragona, 43002, Spain; Institut de Paleoecologia Humana I Evolució Social (IPHES), Zona Educacional, Campus Sescelades URV (Edifici W3) E3, Tarragona, 43700, Spain","source title":"Quaternary International","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"New technologies applied to archaeology.

To make an appropriate study of three-dimensional form we require a method for analysing size-related change in multiple measures of form.

We have applied this approach to an analysis of several biface assemblages from separate parts of the Kilombe site complex. Allometry is an important component in all the localities, but one area observes a different set of adjustments. We argue that the allometry is probably imposed in response to functional requirements: it suggests that Homo erectus was constrained to follow a number of different guiding principles in the manufacturing process.

Recently, it has been argued that linear marks with the same properties as cut marks can be created by crocodiles, thereby questioning whether secure cut mark identifications can be made in the Early Pleistocene fossil record. Powerful classification methods based on multivariate statistics and machine learning (ML) algorithms have previously successfully discriminated cut marks from most other potentially confounding BSM. However, crocodile-made marks were marginal to or played no role in these comparative analyses. Here, for the first time, we apply state-of-the-art ML methods on crocodile linear BSM and experimental butchery cut marks, showing that the combination of multivariate taphonomy and ML methods provides accurate identification of BSM, including cut and crocodile bite marks.

The objective of this report is to provide a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of the Pleistocene when sea levels were below present day levels. Location: The maps presented here cover tropical Southeast Asia and Austral-Asia. The east-west coverage extends 8000 km from Australia to Sri Lanka. The north-south coverage extends 5000 km from Taiwan to Australia. Methods: Present-day bathymetric depth contours were used to estimate past shore lines and the locations of the major drowned river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves. The timing of sea level changes associated with glaciation over the past 250,000 years was taken from multiple sources that, in some cases, account for tectonic uplift and subsidence during the period in question. Results: This report provides a series of maps that estimate the areas of exposed land in the Indo-Australian region during periods of 17,000, 150,000 and 250,000 years before present. The ancient shorelines are based on present day depth contours of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 120 m. On the maps depicting shorelines at 75, 100 and 120 m below present levels the major Pleistocene river systems of the Sunda and Sahul shelves are depicted. Estimates of the number of major sea level fluctuation events and the duration of time that sea levels were at or below the illustrated level are provided. Main conclusions: Previous reconstructions of sea-level change during the Pleistocene have emphasized the maximum lows. The perspective provided here emphasizes that sea levels were at their maximum lows for relatively short periods of time but were at or below intermediate levels (e.g. at or below 40 m below present-day levels) for more than half of each of the time periods considered.","source":"Scopus","title":"Maps of Pleistocene sea levels in Southeast Asia: Shorelines, river systems and time durations","volume":"27","page start":"1153","authors with affiliations":"Voris, H.K., Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, IL, United States, Department of Zoology, Field Museum of Natural History, 1400 S.

For interpolation of a surface over a fixed set of nodes in the plane, the bending energy is a quadratic form in the heights assigned to the surface. The spline is the superposition of eigenvectors of the bending energy matrix, of successively larger physical scales, over a tilted flat plane having no bending energy at all. When these splines are paired, one representing the x-coordinate of another form and the other the y-coordinate, they aid greatly in the modeling of biological shape change as deformation. In this context, the pair becomes an interpolation map from R2 to R2 relating two sets of landmark points. The spline maps decompose, in the same way as the spline surfaces, into a linear part (an affine transformation) together with the superposition of principal warps, which are geometrically independent, affine-free deformations of progressively smaller geometrical scales. The warps decompose an empirical deformation into orthogonal features more or less as a conventional orthogonal functional analysis decomposes the single scene. This paper demonstrates the decomposition of deformations by principal warps, extends the method to deal with curving edges between landmarks, relates this formalism to other applications of splines current in computer vision, and indicates how they might aid in the extraction of features for analysis, comparison, and diagnosis of biological and medical images. © 1989 IEEE","source":"Scopus","title":"Principal Warps: Thin-Plate Splines and the Decomposition of Deformations","volume":"11","page start":"567","authors with affiliations":"Bookstein, F.L., Center for Human Growth and Development, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States","author(s) id":"7004606384;","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Affine transformations; biharmonic equation; biomedical image analysis; deformation; principal warps; quadratic variation; shape; thin-plate splines; warping","pr_indegree":"11.0","authors":"Bookstein F.L.","doi":"10.1109/34.24792"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":48.68000030517578},{"label":"Buchanan B., Collard M., O\u0027Brien M.J.","x":593.4888916015625,"y":2465.485107421875,"id":"1636","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85077302252","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"1","year":"2019","page end":"181","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85077302252\u0026doi\u003d10.1017%2faaq.2019.89\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dee3e1dd8c53be99abb513994a835b3c6","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK  74104, United States; Department of Archaeology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia  V5A 1S6, Canada; Department of History, Texas AandM University-San Antonio, San Antonio, TX  78224, United States","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"Recent work has demonstrated that Goshen points overlap in time with another group of unfluted lanceolate points from the Plains, Plainview points.

The phenotypic distance between populations, and the influence of several eco-geographical factors on the size and shape of the mandible in island populations, were assessed. Based on mandible shape divergence, the populations of C. suaveolens were clustered into continental, insular Atlantic and insular Mediterranean groups. Archaeological specimens from Molène Island, more than 3400 years old, display a mandible shape signal closer to that of the continental population than those of modern island populations. Conversely, the continental shape signals of the modern populations from Höedic and Sark suggest that these are relatively recent anthropogenic introductions. The populations of C. suaveolens from both the Atlantic and Mediterranean islands (except for Rouzic and Cyprus) show a significant increase in mandible size, compared to those from continental Europe. Significant phenotypic differences support the indigenous condition of C. suaveolens on most of the Atlantic islands, suggesting that the species arrived there before the separation of the Scilly Isles and Ushant from the continent due to the post-glacial rise in sea level.

Thus, there is potential for fossil taxa, particularly fossil hominins, to be distinguished at similar taxonomic levels using molar crown morphology. Unfortunately, due to occlusal attrition, the original crown morphology is often absent in fossil teeth, and this has limited the amount of shape information used to discriminate hominin molars. The enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) of molar teeth preserves considerable shape information, particularly in regard to the original shape of the crown, and remains present through the early stages of attrition. In this study, we investigate whether the shape of the EDJ of lower first and second molars can distinguish species and subspecies of extant Pan. Micro-computed tomography was employed to nondestructively image the EDJ, and geometric morphometric analytical methods were used to compare EDJ shape among samples of Pan paniscus (N \u003d 17), Pan troglodytes troglodytes (N \u003d 13), and Pan troglodytes verus (N \u003d 18). Discriminant analysis indicates that EDJ morphology distinguishes among extant Pan species and subspecies with a high degree of reliability. The morphological differences in EDJ shape among the taxa are subtle and relate to the relative height and position of the dentine horns, the height of the dentine crown, and the shape of the crown base, but their existence supports the inclusion of EDJ shape (particularly those aspects of shape in the vertical dimension) in the systematic analysis of fossil hominin lower molars. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Discrimination of extant Pan species and subspecies using the enamel-dentine junction morphology of lower molars","volume":"140","authors with affiliations":"Skinner, M.M., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz 6, Leipzig 04103, Germany, Center for the Advanced Study of Hominid Paleobiology, Department of Anthropology, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052, United States; Gunz, P., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz 6, Leipzig 04103, Germany; Wood, B.A., Center for the Advanced Study of Hominid Paleobiology, Department of Anthropology, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052, United States; Boesch, C., Department of Primatology, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig 04103, Germany; Hublin, J.-J., Department of Human Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Deutscher Platz 6, Leipzig 04103, Germany","author(s) id":"35724424000;6506472733;7401873883;26642873000;6602606027;","index keywords":"article; comparative anatomy; controlled study; dentin; discriminant analysis; enamel; micro-computed tomography; molar tooth; morphometrics; nonhuman; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; subspecies; tooth crown; Animals; Classification; Dental Enamel; Dentin; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Molar; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Principal Component Analysis; Species Specificity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Pan; Pan paniscus; Pan troglodytes; Pan troglodytes troglodytes; Pan troglodytes verus","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Geometric morphometrics; Micro-computed tomography; Sliding semilandmarks; Tooth morphology","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Skinner M.M., Gunz P., Wood B.A., Boesch C., Hublin J.-J.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.21057"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Hay R.L.","x":-3562.5986328125,"y":-547.58544921875,"id":"8816","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003904043","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","authors with affiliations":"Hay, R.L.","Modularity Class":"3","year":"1976","source title":"Geology of the Olduvai Gorge","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"3.0","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Hay R.L."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Wallace M., Bonhomme V., Russell J., Stillman E., George T.S., Ramsay L., Wishart J., Timpany S., Bull H., Booth A., Martin P.","x":56.1930046081543,"y":104.53469848632812,"id":"427","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85056694105","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"1","issue":"3","year":"2019","page end":"1142","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85056694105\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs10816-018-9402-2\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d05b2fc7c98f10b8d3253648b3ad42c4e","affiliations":"Department of Archaeology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, South Yorkshire  S1 3NJ, United Kingdom; Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution-Montpellier, Université de Montpellier, Montpellier Cedex 2, 34095, France; The James Hutton Institute, Dundee, DD2 5DA, United Kingdom; School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S3 7RH, United Kingdom; Agronomy Institute, Orkney College, University of the Highlands and Islands, Kirkwall, KW15 1LX, United Kingdom; Archaeology Institute, Orkney College, University of the Highlands and Islands, Kirkwall, KW15 1LX, United Kingdom","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory","abstract":"Bere is a landrace of barley, adapted to the marginal conditions of northern Scotland, especially those of the Northern and Western Isles.

The longevity of bere raises the possibility of using grain characteristics of present-day specimens to identify bere in the archaeological record. Geometric modern morphometric (GMM) analysis of grains from bere and other barley landraces is conducted to determine whether landraces can be differentiated on grain morphology. Results indicate that there are morphological differences between bere and other British and Scandinavian landraces, and between bere from Orkney and the Western Isles, both of which are apparent in genetic analysis. This finding paves the way for the identification of bere archaeologically, helping to establish its status as living heritage and securing its commercial future.

Overall, among-population differences in extant Homo sapiens cranial morphology are proportional to among-population differences in neutral molecular characteristics. For most of the populations studied, cranial morphology varies among regions in a manner consistent with neutral expectations. Removal of the effects of shared population history and structure by using the partial Mantel\u0027s test, however, does not remove the correlation between some aspects of cranial morphology and a measure of coldness of climate. The excess differentiation is most apparent in those population comparisons that involve a Siberian population living in an extremely cold environment. This finding suggests the action of natural selection, associated with regional variation in temperature, leading to among-population differentiation in excess of neutral expectations for some cranial dimensions. Those dimensions reflect the breadth of the skull, cranial vault size and shape, and aspects of nasal morphology. Although morphology for most of the world appears to vary among populations in accordance with neutral expectations in the context of population structure and history, morphology of the Siberian population appears to have undergone adaptation by natural selection.","source":"Scopus","title":"Detecting interregionally diversifying natural selection on modern human cranial form by using matched molecular and morphometric data","volume":"101","page start":"12824","authors with affiliations":"Roseman, C.C., Dept. of Anthropological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-2117, United States","author(s) id":"6701907722;","index keywords":"DNA; article; craniofacial morphology; ethnic group; genetic variability; geographic distribution; human; morphology; morphometrics; natural selection; population genetics; priority journal; skull; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Selection (Genetics); Skull; Variation (Genetics); Homo; Homo sapiens","document type":"Article","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Roseman C.C.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0402637101"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Yravedra J., García-Vargas E., Maté-González M.Á., Aramendi J., Palomeque-González J.F., Vallés-Iriso J., Matesanz-Vicente J., González-Aguilera D., Domínguez-Rodrigo M.","x":-4405.74169921875,"y":767.4995727539062,"id":"8629","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85019725876","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.01443298969072165","Modularity Class":"3","year":"2017","page end":"115","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85019725876\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jasrep.2017.05.043\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d64840c93f82edd17b6b7a7b5460fee34","affiliations":"Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain; IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Museo de los Orígenes, Plaza de San Andrés 2, Madrid, 28005, Spain; Department of Cartography and Terrain Engineering, Polytechnic School of Avila, University of Salamanca, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila, 05003, Spain; C.A.I de Arqueometría y Análisis Arqueológico, Universidad Complutense.

One of them is related to the action of carnivores, which is reflected in conspicuous tooth marks, such as pits, scores, punctures or furrowing. Different carnivores damage bone assemblages differently. Thus, several researches have tried to identify carnivore agency based on different parameters such as skeletal profiles, tooth mark frequencies and dimensions, breakage patterns, or more recently, taphotypes. Here we propose a new methodology based on the analysis of tooth scores to determine the carnivore type involved in bone modification. For this purpose, we have built 3D models of several tooth scores produced by wolves, lions, jaguars, foxes and hyenas using photogrammetric techniques. These models were later analyzed by means of Geometric Morphometrics and multivariate statistics. We show that although there is a high degree of overlap in tooth mark morphology, the combined action of tooth score dimensions and morphology enables the identification of some of the tooth scores made by lions from those of the other carnivores with a higher degree of confidence than any other inter-carnivore comparison. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","source":"Scopus","title":"The use of Micro-Photogrammetry and Geometric Morphometrics for identifying carnivore agency in bone assemblages","volume":"14","page start":"106","authors with affiliations":"Yravedra, J., Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain, IDEA (Institute of Evolution in Africa), Museo de los Orígenes, Plaza de San Andrés 2, Madrid, 28005, Spain; García-Vargas, E., Department of Prehistory, Complutense University, Prof. Aranguren s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain; Maté-González, M.Á., Department of Cartography and Terrain Engineering, Polytechnic School of Avila, University of Salamanca, Hornos Caleros 50, Avila, 05003, Spain, C.A.I de Arqueometría y Análisis Arqueológico, Universidad Complutense.

Despite the importance of the concept of symmetry to studies of early human development, its current use is usually based on loose qualitative assessment. A more informative approach would be to use a continuous scale of this shape property rather than the strict current language of \"more\" or \"less\". A symmetry measurement tool has been developed, which is based on evaluation of the minimal distances that the vertices of a structure have to move in order to attain the required symmetry. Using this Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM) method, it is possible to evaluate quantitatively how much symmetry exists in a non-symmetrical configuration and how the nearest symmetrical shape looks. We test and demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of this approach on handaxe samples from three Lower Paleolithic sites in Israel, Ubeidiya, Gesher Benot Ya\u0027aqov and Ma\u0027ayan Barukh, representing various stages in the Acheulian Techno-complex of the Levant.

Hence, this hypothesis is based on the assumption that similarities between Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores can be interpreted as being phylogenetically homologous (i.e. due to common technological ancestry) as opposed to being homoplasic (i.e. due to convergent technological evolution). Here, the phylogenetic basis of this hypothesis is tested using a formal cladistic procedure. Under the framework of an \u0027iterative\u0027 approach to phylogenetic analysis, a series of post-hoc tests and re-evaluations of results follow the initial cladistic analysis. Results of these combined analyses indicate that morphological similarities between Mode 2 Acheulean handaxes and Mode 3 Levallois cores can, most parsimoniously, be seen as phylogenetically homologous. Hence, these results support the tenets of the \u0027Movius-Schick\u0027 hypothesis in suggesting that a lack of Levallois industries in East Asia may be due to the paucity of an ancestral Acheulean tradition in that region. The implications of these phylogenetic analyses for the concept of Palaeolithic \u0027Modes\u0027 are discussed. It is further suggested that low demographic levels (i.e. small effective population sizes) in East Asia may have constrained the technological phylogenetic trajectory of East Asia compared with that seen in other regions of the Old World during the Lower Palaeolithic. In addition, it is hoped that several methodological issues discussed here will contribute to the growing field of cultural phylogenetic analysis. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Virtual anthropology (VA) contributes to comparative morphology by taking advantage of technological innovations, and it also offers new opportunities for functional analyses. It exploits digital technologies and pools experts from different domains such as anthropology, primatology, medicine, paleontology, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and engineering. VA as a technical term was coined in the late 1990s from the perspective of anthropologists with the intent of being mostly applied to biological questions concerning recent and fossil hominoids. More generally, however, there are advanced methods to study shape and size or to manipulate data digitally suitable for application to all kinds of primates, mammals, other vertebrates, and invertebrates or to issues regarding plants, tools, or other objects. In this sense, we could also call the field \"virtual morphology.\" The approach yields permanently available virtual copies of specimens and data that comprehensively quantify geometry, including previously neglected anatomical regions. It applies advanced statistical methods, supports the reconstruction of specimens based on reproducible manipulations, and promotes the acquisition of larger samples by data sharing via electronic archives. Finally, it can help identify new, hidden traits, which is particularly important in paleoanthropology, where the scarcity of material demands extracting information from fragmentary remains. This contribution presents a current view of the six main work steps of VA: digitize, expose, compare, reconstruct, materialize, and share. The VA machinery has also been successfully used in biomechanical studies which simulate the stress and strains appearing in structures. Although methodological issues remain to be solved before results from the two domains can be fully integrated, the various overlaps and cross-fertilizations suggest the widespread appearance of a \"virtual functional morphology\" in the near future. © 2014 American Association of Physical Anthropologists.","source":"Scopus","title":"Virtual anthropology","volume":"156","page start":"22","authors with affiliations":"Webere, G.W., Department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Althanstr. 14, Vienna, A-1090, Austria, Core Facility for Micro-Computed Tomography, University of Vienna, Vienna, A-1090, Austria","author(s) id":"57188930505;","index keywords":"animals; anthropology; anthropology, physical; archaeology; biomechanics; biometry; comparative anatomy; Computational Biology; computer assisted tomography; evolution; fossil; Fossils; functional morphology; history; Hominidae; human; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; methods; morphometrics; nonhuman; paleoanthropology; physical anthropology; Review; trends; virtual anthropology; Animals; Anthropology, Physical; Archaeology; Biometry; Computational Biology; Fossils; Hominidae; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; methods; methods; methods; methods; trends; trends","document type":"Review","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Biomechanics; Comparative morphology; Functional morphology; Geometric morphometrics; Human evolution; Shape and form analysis; Virtual anthropology; Virtual morphology","pr_indegree":"2.0","authors":"Webere G.W.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.22658"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":13.760000228881836},{"label":"Boschin F., Crezzini J.","x":-4779.5234375,"y":203.05032348632812,"id":"8637","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84867331436","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.012371134020618556","Modularity Class":"3","issue":"5","year":"2012","page end":"562","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84867331436\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2foa.1272\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dd692d78aa0b8bca3bb29fa454d8b5caa","affiliations":"Dipartimento di Scienze Ambientali G.

Discrimination of predefined groups is a very different problem than trying to characterize the patterns of morphological variation among individuals, and so the kinds of morphometric tools used for these two kinds of questions differ. In this paper I review the basic procedures used for discriminating groups of organisms based on morphological characteristics – measures of size and shape. A critical reading of morphometric discrimination studies of various kinds of organisms in recent years suggests that a review of procedures is warranted, particularly with regard to the kinds of assumptions being made. I will discuss the main concepts and methods used in problems of discrimination, first using conventional morphometric characters (measured distances between putatively homologous landmarks), and then using landmarks directly with geometric morphometric approaches. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","source":"Scopus","title":"Discriminating groups of organisms","volume":"124","authors with affiliations":"Strauss, R.E., Department of Biological Sciences, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX  79409-3131, United States","author(s) id":"7202966775;","document type":"Book Chapter","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Strauss R.E.","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-95853-6_4"},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Claude J.","x":776.1799926757812,"y":-700.6303100585938,"id":"8644","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-67349169356","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","authors with affiliations":"Claude, J.","Modularity Class":"2","year":"2008","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Morphometrics with R","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"3.0","title":"Morphometrics with R","authors":"Claude J."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Lidicker W.Z.","x":-1321.6234130859375,"y":1342.1156005859375,"id":"9047","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0002006451","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"2","issue":"1","year":"1966","page end":"50","source title":"Ecological Monographs","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Ecological observations on a feral house mouse population declining to extinction","volume":"36","page start":"27","authors with affiliations":"Lidicker, W.Z.","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","authors":"Lidicker W.Z."},"color":"rgb(0,61,87)","size":17.639999389648438},{"label":"Cucchi T., Kov�cs Z.E., Berthon R., Orth A., Bonhomme F., Evin A., Siahsarvie R., Darvish J., Bakhshaliyev V., Marro C.","x":-1228.8082275390625,"y":1194.900390625,"id":"6435","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84875069212","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"2","year":"2013","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84875069212\u0026doi\u003d10.1111%2fbij.12004\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d4a7b2d2ae6f4cc7268bff3376d21b312","affiliations":"UMR 7209 \u0027Archeozoologie Archeobotanique: soci�t�s, pratiques et environnements\u0027, CNRS, Mus�um National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, 55 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France; Archaeology Department, University of Aberdeen, Elphinstone Road, Scotland, Aberdeen, AB24 3UF, United Kingdom; Hungarian National Museum, National Heritage Protection Centre, Budapest, Hungary; Graduate School \u0027Human Development in Landscapes\u0027, Christian-Albrechts-Universit�t, Kiel, Germany; CNRS UMR5554, Institut des Sciences de l\u0027Evolution, Universit� Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France; Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran; Rodentology Research Department, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran; Department of Archaeology, National Academy of Science of Azerbaijan, Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan; UMR 5133, Archeorient, Environnements et Societes de l\u0027Orient Ancien Maison de l\u0027Orient et de la Mediterranee, CNRS, Universit� Lyon 2, Lyon, France","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society","source":"Scopus","title":"On the trail of Neolithic mice and men towards Transcaucasia: Zooarchaeological clues from Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan)","document type":"Article","root":"true","pr_indegree":"0.0","issue":"4","page end":"928","abstract":"Transcaucasia comprises a key region for understanding the history of both the hybrid zone between house mouse lineages and the dispersal of the Neolithic way of life outside its Near Eastern cradle. The opportunity to document the colonization history of both men and mice in Transcaucasia was made possible by the discovery of mouse remains accumulated in pits from a 6000-year-old farming village in the Nakhchivan (Autonomous Republic of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan). The present study investigated their taxonomy and most likely dispersal path through the identification of the Mus lineage to which they might belong using a geometric morphometric approach of dental traits distances between archaeological and modern populations of the different Mus lineages of South-West Asia. We demonstrate that the mouse remains trapped in the deep storage pits of the dwelling belong to the Mus musculus domesticus from the Near East, with dental shapes similar to current populations in Northern Syria. These results strongly suggest that the domesticus lineage was dispersed into Transcaucasia from the upper Euphrates valley by Neolithic migration, some time between the 7th and 5th millennium BC, providing substantial evidence to back up the scenario featuring near-eastern stimuli in the emergence of agriculture in the South Caucasus. The domesticus mitochondrial DNA signature of the current house mouse in the same location 5000 years later, as well as their turnover towards a subspecies musculus/castaneus phenotype, suggests that early domesticus colonizers hybridized with a later musculus (and maybe castaneus) dispersal originating from south of the Caspian Sea and/or Northern Caucasia. � 2013 The Linnean Society of London.","volume":"108","page start":"917","authors with affiliations":"Cucchi, T., UMR 7209 \u0027Archeozoologie Archeobotanique: soci�t�s, pratiques et environnements\u0027, CNRS, Mus�um National d\u0027Histoire Naturelle, 55 rue Buffon, Paris, 75005, France, Archaeology Department, University of Aberdeen, Elphinstone Road, Scotland, Aberdeen, AB24 3UF, United Kingdom;

The ancestors of the Inuit were the first to introduce the widespread usage of dog sledge transportation technology to the Americas, but whether the Inuit adopted local Palaeo-Inuit dogs or introduced a new dog population to the region remains unknown. To test these hypotheses, we generated mitochondrial DNA and geometric morphometric data of skull and dental elements from a total of 922 North American Arctic dogs and wolves spanning over 4500 years. Our analyses revealed that dogs from Inuit sites dating from2000 BP possess morphological and genetic signatures that distinguish them from earlier Palaeo-Inuit dogs, and identified a novel mitochondrial clade in eastern Siberia and Alaska. The genetic legacy of these Inuit dogs survives today in modern Arctic sledge dogs despite phenotypic differences between archaeological and modern Arctic dogs. Together, our data reveal that Inuit dogs derive from a secondary pre-contact migration of dogs distinct from Palaeo-Inuit dogs, and probably aided the Inuit expansion across the North American Arctic beginning around 1000 BP. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","source":"Scopus","title":"Specialized sledge dogs accompanied Inuit dispersal across the North American Arctic","volume":"286","authors with affiliations":"Ameen, C., Department of Archaeology, University of Exeter, Exeter, Devon, United Kingdom, Department of Archaeology Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, United Kingdom;

The distinction between most of the Prunus species, based on traditional morphological characters of the fruit stones, is usually not problematic. However the discrimination between P. avium L., P. cerasus L. and related cherry species, based on classical criteria alone, often turns out to be ambiguous because of the increasing number of varieties which have been bred since Roman times. By combining geometric and traditional morphometrical approaches, the overall variation in shape and size of stones from French and Swiss excavations dating from the 1st century to the 16th century a. d. were assessed. Among these important archaeobotanical data, the detailed examination of 100 waterlogged stones from the 16th century Hôtel-Dieu cesspit at Tours, France, revealed that the morphological diversity is structured into two distinct morphotypes which diverge mainly according to geometrical features. Finally, the comparison between morphological features of these well-preserved archaeological stones and modern reference material including P. avium, P. cerasus and P. × gondouinii, suggests that these two morphotypes, which have been initially attributed to P. avium (long stones) and P. avium/cerasus (rounded stones) according to traditional morphological parameters, would correspond to two different cultivated varieties, both belonging to Prunus avium.

This study provides a new statistical framework for the identification of both domestic and wild Sus scrofa using standard molar tooth lengths and widths from a large modern comparative collection consisting of 407 West Palearctic wild boar and domestic pigs. Our study continues to rely upon so-called \u0027cut-off\u0027 values that correspond to the optimal separation between the two groups, but based upon a measure and visualisation of the error risk curves for erroneous identifications. On average, wild boar have larger teeth than domestic pigs and cut-off values were established for maximum tooth length and width, respectively as follows: 2.39cm and 1.85cm for second upper molar, 3.69cm and 2.13cm for third upper molar, 2.26cm and 1.50cm for second lower molar, 3.79cm and 1.75cm for third lower molar. Specimens below and above these cut-offs are most likely to be, respectively, domestic pig and wild boar and the risk of providing a wrong identification will depend on the distance to the cut-off value following a relative risk curve. Although likely containing high risk of inherent statistical error, nonetheless this basic metrical identification-tool (based only on recent specimens), is here shown to correctly re-identify 94% of the Neolithic pigs from Durrington Walls (England) as domestic pig.

Levallois technology remains an important focus for research in Palaeolithic archaeology, yet quantitative morphological comparisons of Levallois core morphology from different regions remain rare. Here, utilizing Levallois cores from Africa, the Near East, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent, patterns of morphological variability in the shape of the Levallois flaking surface and core outline (margin) shape were examined for patterns of variability and stability across regions using 3D geometric morphometrics. The multivariate statistical shape analyses undertaken revealed a clear pattern: that is, the greatest levels of shape variability in Levallois cores is evident in the form of their outline (planform) shape. Conversely, the geometrical relationship between the margin of the Levallois cores and their topological surface morphology was relatively uniform. This pattern of variability was evident in terms of variation both across regions and between cores from the same locality. These results indicate that the outline form of such cores was a less important variable than the geometric/topological properties of the surface morphology and, in particular, the relationship between the margin of the core and those variables. These results have implications for why it has been reported that replicating such cores in modern experiments is a particularly difficult task. The specific interrelationship between the geometric properties of the core and the core margin provide further evidence that Levallois core technology would be unlikely to emerge from the context of opportunistic migrating platform reduction strategies (such as those seen in many Mode 1 industries). If, as is widely suggested, Levallois cores were deliberate products in Pleistocene contexts, these results also hint that relatively sophisticated means of social transmission (i.e. teaching) may have been required to sustain their production over time and space. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"A 3D morphometric analysis of surface geometry in Levallois cores: Patterns of stability and variability across regions and their implications","volume":"40","page start":"1508","authors with affiliations":"Lycett, S.J., Department of Anthropology, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NR, United Kingdom; Von Cramon-Taubadel, N., Department of Anthropology, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent CT2 7NR, United Kingdom","author(s) id":"9434693200;23471109300;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; archaeology; geometry; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; technological development; Africa; Europe; India","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Core variation; Geometric morphometric analysis; Levallois","pr_indegree":"11.0","authors":"Lycett S.J., Von Cramon-Taubadel N.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.11.005"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":48.68000030517578},{"label":"Fukase H., Ito T., Ishida H.","x":1018.9546508789062,"y":-3224.641845703125,"id":"4808","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84940986776","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","Modularity Class":"4","issue":"3","year":"2016","page end":"351","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84940986776\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2fajhb.22786\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003df7cf4285526e12ada756ab47a36c6738","affiliations":"Division of Human Evolution Studies, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido UniversityHokkaido  060-8638, Japan; Department of Human Biology and Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, University of the RyukyusOkinawa  903-0215, Japan","source title":"American Journal of Human Biology","abstract":"Objectives: Geographic variation in human nasal form has often been interpreted as a climatic adaptation, owing to the nasal air-conditioning function. The aim of this study was to further address morphofunctional issues of the nasal cavity, using three human groups from subarctic, temperate, and subtropical regions of the Japanese Archipelago: prehistoric Okhotsk, early-modern Honshu and Okinawa groups. Methods: Using three-dimensional coordinates of craniometric landmarks surrounding the nasal cavity, we compared linear measurements regarding nasal cavity form among the three groups and also conducted 3D geometric morphometrics. Results: Both linear measurements and morphometric analyses corroborate the previously reported covariation pattern of nasal cavity shape with climate, where humans from a cold/dry climate tend to possess a relatively tall, narrow, and deep nasal cavity compared with those from a warm/humid environment. The northern Okhotsk group had overall larger cranial airways, which may be attributable to their large facial skeleton. However, the ratio of nasal/bimaxillary breadth was significantly lower in the Okhotsk group, indicating that maxillary size does not necessarily constrain the nasal breadth. In addition, despite the presence of obvious geographic clines in anterior nasal shape, posterior choanal shape lacked the north-south geographic cline. This suggests a certain level of morphofunctional independence between the anterior and posterior nasal openings. Conclusions: The observed geographic variations must, however, be partly considered as a reflection of different ancestral traits and population histories of the three groups. Nevertheless, the results indicate that intergroup variations in nasal cavity morphology can be largely explained by climatic conditions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"Geographic variation in nasal cavity form among three human groups from the Japanese Archipelago: Ecogeographic and functional implications","volume":"28","page start":"343","authors with affiliations":"Fukase, H., Division of Human Evolution Studies, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido UniversityHokkaido  060-8638, Japan; Ito, T., Department of Human Biology and Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, University of the RyukyusOkinawa  903-0215, Japan; Ishida, H., Department of Human Biology and Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, University of the RyukyusOkinawa  903-0215, Japan","author(s) id":"16202536400;55471124700;55437344300;","index keywords":"anatomy and histology; archeology; cephalometry; history; human; Japan; nose cavity; physical anthropology; Anthropology, Physical; Archaeology; Cephalometry; History, 18th Century; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Japan; Nasal Cavity","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"0.0","authors":"Fukase H., Ito T., Ishida H.","doi":"10.1002/ajhb.22786"},"color":"rgb(133,0,32)","size":6.0},{"label":"Eerkens J.W., Lipo C.P.","x":2649.0400390625,"y":3277.008544921875,"id":"8687","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-28244440525","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.006185567010309278","Modularity Class":"6","issue":"4","year":"2005","page end":"334","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-28244440525\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jaa.2005.08.001\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d803d339f7ed9358cb2a070e499fa0106","affiliations":"Department of Anthropology, University of California, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, United States; Department of Anthropology, California State University Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Boulevard, Long Beach, CA 90840, United States","source title":"Journal of Anthropological Archaeology","abstract":"Archaeologists are adept at analyzing variation in artifacts. The discipline has well established and tested methods to track change through time and to evaluate the function of artifacts that depend upon measures of variation in the archaeological record. Although a critical concept, the means by which variation in material culture is generated is not well understood. This paper explores one source of variation, copying errors, and systematically examines how cultural transmission processes act to amplify, reduce, or maintain such variation. Using simple models, we generate expected distributions for the amount of variation that occurs through time under varying circumstances. This variation is caused by small errors that are transmitted from one person to another in the propagation and replication of cultural traits. These baseline values provide useful null models for explaining variation in prehistoric assemblages of artifacts.

The precise origins and dispersal routes of the Austronesian peoples and the associated Lapita culture remain contentious, and numerous disparate models of dispersal (based primarily on linguistic, genetic, and archeological data) have been proposed. Here, through the use of mtDNA from 781 modern and ancient Sus specimens, we provide evidence for an early human-mediated translocation of the Sulawesi warty pig (Sus celebensis) to Flores and Timor and two later separate human-mediated dispersals of domestic pig (Sus scrofa) through Island Southeast Asia into Oceania. Of the later dispersal routes, one is unequivocally associated with the Neolithic (Lapita) and later Polynesian migrations and links modern and archeological Javan, Sumatran, Wallacean, and Oceanic pigs with mainland Southeast Asian S. scrofa. Archeological and genetic evidence shows these pigs were certainly introduced to islands east of the Wallace Line, including New Guinea, and that so-called \"wild\" pigs within this region are most likely feral descendants of domestic pigs introduced by early agriculturalists. The other later pig dispersal links mainland East Asian pigs to western Micronesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

In parallel, increasing numbers of studies have applied finite elements analysis (FEA) to the study of skeletal mechanics in fossil and extant hominoid material. While FEA studies of fossils are becoming ever more popular they are constrained by the difficulties of reconstruction and by the uncertainty that inevitably attaches to the estimation of forces and material properties. Adding to these modelling difficulties it is still unclear how FEA analyses should best deal with species variation. Comparative studies of skeletal form and function can be further advanced by applying tools from the GM toolkit to the inputs and outputs of FEA studies. First they facilitate virtual reconstruction of damaged material and can be used to rapidly create 3D models of skeletal structures. Second, GM methods allow variation to be accounted for in FEA by warping models to represent mean and extreme forms of interest. Third, GM methods can be applied to compare FEA outputs – the ways in which skeletal elements deform when loaded. Model comparisons are hampered by differences in material properties, forces and size among models but how deformations from FEA are impacted by these parameters is increasingly well understood, allowing them to be taken into account in comparing FEA outputs.

More recently, this claim has been modified to include stone tool standardization as a feature of modern human behavior (e.g., Klein, J World Prehistory 9:167-198, 1995). It has been argued elsewhere (Chase 1991, Monnier, Cambridge Archaeological Journal 17:341-350, 2007) that standardization and apparent imposition of form in retouched tools reflect factors other than adherence to mental templates. This study tests the notion that standardization is a feature of behavioral modernity by comparing artifact standardization among Middle Paleolithic, Upper Paleolithic, and Neolithic assemblages from western Switzerland. It uses a 2D geometric morphometric approach to quantify variance in shape within selected tool types. The results show that the most highly standardized types occur in the Upper Paleolithic assemblage. Neolithic types are significantly less standardized than Upper Paleolithic types, and are not more standardized than Middle Paleolithic ones. This suggests that degree of standardization does not correlate strongly with behavioral modernity; rather, the occurrence of highly standardized tools in many Upper Paleolithic assemblages is a feature unique to the Upper Paleolithic, and the reasons for it most likely do not directly reflect mental templates or any other cognitive factors. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.","source":"Scopus","title":"Questioning the link between stone tool standardization and behavioral modernity","page start":"61","authors with affiliations":"Monnier, G.F., Department of Anthropology, University of Minnesota, 395 Hubert H.

We test the hypothesis that fronto‐occipital artificial reshaping of the neurocranial vault results in specific changes in the cranial base and face. Fronto‐occipital reshaping results from the application of pads or a cradle board which constrains cranial vault growth, limiting growth between the frontal and occipital and allowing compensatory growth of the parietals in a mediolateral direction. Two skeletal series including both normal and artificially modified crania are analyzed, a prehistoric Peruvian Ancon sample (47 normal, 64 modified crania) and a Songish Indian sample from British Columbia (6 normal, 4 modified). Three‐dimensional coordinates of 53 landmarks were measured with a diagraph and used to form 9 finite elements as a prelude to finite element scaling analysis. Finite element scaling was used to compare average normal and modified crania and the results were evaluated for statistical significance using a bootstrap test. Fronto‐occipitally reshaped Ancon crania are significantly different from normal in the vault, cranial base, and face. The vault is compressed along an anterior‐superior to posterior‐inferior axis and expanded along a mediolateral axis in modified individuals. The cranial base is wider and shallower in the modified crania in the face is foreshortened and wider with the anterior orbital rim moving inferior and posterior towards the cranial base. The Songish crania display a different modification of the vault and face, indicating that important differences may exist in the morphological effects of fronto‐occipital reshaping from one group to another. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

Since then, the majority of the scientific community has interpreted Teshik-Tash as a Neanderthal. However, some have considered aspects of the morphology of the Teshik-Tash skull to be more similar to fossil modern humans such as those represented at SkhÅl and Qafzeh, or to subadult Upper Paleolithic modern humans. Here we present a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of the Teshik-Tash frontal bone in the context of developmental shape changes in recent modern humans, Neanderthals, and early modern humans. We assess the phenetic affinities of Teshik-Tash to other subadult fossils, and use developmental simulations to predict possible adult shapes. We find that the morphology of the frontal bone places the Teshik-Tash child close to other Neanderthal children and that the simulated adult shapes are closest to Neanderthal adults. Taken together with genetic data showing that Teshik-Tash carried mtDNA of the Neanderthal type, as well as its occipital bun, and its shovel-shaped upper incisors, these independent lines of evidence firmly place Teshik-Tash among Neanderthals.
